in this segment I will give a brief

introduction to the task of part of

speech tagging and then we'll come back

and see how discriminative sequence

models can be used as a technique for

part of speech tagging there are many

linguistic traditions in different parts

of the globe but in the West the idea of

parts of speech perhaps started with

Aristotle and in the 4th century before

the Common Era and he suggested the idea

that there were parts of speech which

are otherwise known as lexical

categories word classes tags or POS as a

common abbreviation now but what we

think of today as the parts of speech

are normally attributed to Dynasty as

threats of Alexandria who proposed that

there were eight parts of speech and

that's the number that's still with us

today is the number of parts of speech

people get taught in school sometime

though actually if you look into the

details a little the eight parts of

speech the diagnosis threats proposed

aren't the same that with us today

so the normal list that people are

taught in schools in English now noun

verb adjective adverb preposition

conjunction pronoun interjection but for

Thrax there was actually some little

differences in the list and of course he

was working with ancient Greek and not

with English so the beginning of the

list starts out the same but note that

he doesn't recognize adjectives as a

part of speech in Greek and Latin

adjectives and nouns behave very

similarly but he does recognize possible

as a part of speech and then the other

difference is that a separate part of

speech is given for articles words like

that and are whereas in the modern list

you get a class for interjections the

status of articles has always been a bit

controversial in our current standards

set of eight parts of speech articles

are seen as a case of adjectives but

actually as soon as you start looking at

the grammar of languages like English

that the articles have a very special

behavior which is quite different from

regular adjectives for example

adjectives you can get multiple off

large green leather couch where

you can't do things like that our this

book except as a kind of speech

hesitation as to which article you

should be using when we do part of

speech taking in computational

linguistics we normally work with rather

more than eight parts of speech because

there are a lot of distinctions which

can be useful to make that multiplies

the number of parts of speech and I

start to indicate the kinds of parts of

speech you get in this slide and you can

see that there are various hierarchical

groupings so inside nouns we can divide

into proper nouns and common nouns and

we might also want to divide between

singular and plural which would happen

with both proper and common nouns verbs

very much divided into main verb see

registered verses various exhilarated

modal verbs like Ken and had there are

adjectives and adverbs note that

adjectives at least the short adjectives

in English have several forms the

positive comparative and superlative and

we might want to distinguish those forms

as well neither of the lists on the last

slide had numbers but they seemed a

fairly obvious and practically useful

part of speech to recognize and then

similarly here among the clothes classes

I'll say a bit more about clothes

classes on the next slide we don't have

a category of this called articles we

have a category called determiners so

the modern linguistic tradition is to

group the articles r and r together with

certain other demonstratives that behave

similarly words like some this and then

we have some other categories

prepositions are familiar but we're

distinguishing off a class of particles

so the particles here and words are

normally the same as prepositions but

take part in English phrasal verb

constructions things like made-up

meaning to invent the top level

distinction on the last slide was

between open classes and closed classes

it's very clear that not all parts of

speech are the same some of them like

determinants and pronouns are occupied

by only a small set of words so in

English for pronouns there's he/she heed

him/her in the first and second person

pronouns I you we third-person plural

they them but it's just a very small set

of words and that there aren't new

pronouns being invented and so things

like that we call closed class because

in general closed classes don't get new

members though you know sometimes

occasionally they do over long term

language change so sometimes people have

suggested that we should be inventing

some new gender-neutral pronouns in

English though nothing's really taken

off but in contrast the open classes

nouns verbs adjectives adverbs these are

classes which have a vast number of

members and beyond that it's very easy

for them to gain new members so that

when we have a new protocol and computer

science we create a new noun for it like

SSH and then very quickly we decide it's

useful to use that as a verb as well and

then we say is SH din to my server to

fix the configuration the task a part of

speech tagging is to say for each word

what it's part of speech is in the

context of some running text the reason

why that's not trivial is because lots

of words have more than one part of

speech so for example for the word back

it can be an adjective when it's

modifying a noun like the back door it

can be a noun when it's referring to the

body part on my back it can be an adverb

in a phrase like when the voters back

and it can also then be a verb in

another political example promised to

back the bill and so what we wanting to

do is when we see an instance of the

word back assign it to one of these

parts of speech so in the task a part of

speech tagging we start with some text

plays well with others and then for each

word we consider what are its possible

parts of speech so that plays can be a

plural noun or verb well can be an

interjection and actually turf and noun

or an adverb

with can be is just a preposition here

and others as a plural noun and so for

the words that are ambiguous we're then

going to choose for them what they

correct part of speech is in context and

so here pleases a verb and well as an

adverb modifying plays and we get

disambiguating these parts of speech so

what we're finding here at the end when

we've got you know these choices here

which we're then determining these are

our part of speech tags and depending on

the part of speech tag said they're

commonly in natural language processing

applications somewhere between twelve

and hundred part of speech tags that are

differentiated and so you can see that

this set of part of speech tags it's

differentiating things like is that a

plural noun or a singular noun here's a

singular noun or if it is a verb what

form of the verb it is so this is the

third-person seeing your plays as

opposed to play so the particular part

of speech tag set that we're seeing here

is the pin treebank part of speech tags

which are the most commonly used part of

speech tags the English especially in

the United States I'm embarrassed to say

that I've been in this business long

enough that I can actually tell you off

my heart what all the pin part of speech

takes they're a set of 45 of them which

cover word classes like this and

punctuation so what good is part of

speech tagging as well as letting you

answer your high school English problems

it has a variety of other users it has

some particular users we're just parts

of speech a sufficient so that if you're

doing text-to-speech and you want and

you see an instance of the word le ad

you want to know whether to pronounce

that as a lead or lead and the answer to

that is what's its part of speech if

it's a verb its lead if it's a noun is

led having parts of speech let you

easily do some surface linguistic

analysis so for lots of applications is

useful to pick out what we call base

noun phrases so there now

now in compound possibly modified in

front by a determiner and some

adjectives so the nearest school or an

old green couch our base noun phrases

where as big complex noun phrases with

relative clauses off after the Mart now

if we have parts of speech we can easily

write regular expressions that pick out

things like base noun phrases or verbs

followed by particle for phrasal verbs

and that can be used for a lot of

applications where you want to do

shallow processing but nevertheless want

to be able to put to give to the user

more tailored keywords or something like

that

part of speech taking is commonly used

as input to or to speed up a parser so

quite a few parcels work on already part

of speech tag set text and even once

that can do their own part of speech

tagging can often be sped up by first

doing the process a part of speech

tagging and finally a lot of models we

build for probability estimation are

very sparse if they try and work at the

word level and we discussed various ways

of backing off where you might back off

from a trigram drawer diagram earlier

but another common way of backing off is

to back off from a word that you don't

know much about to its part of speech

category you can predict based on

knowing it's an adjective part of speech

taken performance is normally measured

as accuracy what percent of tags do you

get right and the answer that that for

the best current taggers they get about

97% of words right that sounds really

good it is important to realize that

part of speech taking is in some sense

an easy task or at least a task where

you get high numbers so there's a

baseline approach to part of speech

tagging where you've tagged every word

with this most common tag if you know

about it in your training data and if

you don't know about in your training

data you take it as a noun and it turns

out that that fairly simple baseline

method already gives you performance of

90% and so that's it turns out that you

get this high baseline for a couple of

reasons one reason is that many were

birds are an unambiguous that if you see

famous it's always an adjective and also

the way part of speech taking is

normally measured that you get points

for every token so not only do you get

points for every instance of unambiguous

articles which are very common like that

and are you even get points for getting

the part of speech tags or punctuation

right but that doesn't mean that all

parts of speech decisions are easy some

part of speech decisions and quite

difficult even for human beings and so

here are some examples of the word

around so here we have around acting as

a particle got around to here we have

around again straight after a verb but

this time it's this prepositional phrase

around the corner and so around is being

a preposition and here again in this

third example around us again following

straight after a verb but actually this

time it's a modifier of this noun phrase

of around 250 short for around $250 and

so around is then an adverb it's

modifying a number which is kind of like

an adjective it turns out that in

English corpus around 11% of the word

types are ambiguous with regard to part

of speech that doesn't sound like very

many but most of them tend to be common

words such as the word that so that can

be a word that introduces a subordinate

clause and in the penn treebank those

words tagged as i in preposition which

might surprise you there's some

linguistic argument about that it can be

a determiner that play or it can be an

adverb so modifying here far that far is

an adverb and so it turns out that

although only 11% of the word types are

ambiguous as to part of speech about 40%

of the word tokens are ambiguous so

there actually are a lot of decisions

for a part of speech taker to make okay

I hope that's given you a bit of

background information on

of speech tagging so you could make

sense of the task in terms of our

methods for approaching it
