00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.580
Lastly, we will introduce
you to Spark GraphX.

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.021
After this video,
you will be able to describe GraphX is,

3
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.970
explain how vertices and
edges are stored in GraphX, and

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.702
describe how Pregel works at a high level.

5
00:00:24.295 --> 00:00:29.875
GraphX is Apache Spark's Application
Programming Interface for

6
00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.570
graphs and graph-parallel computation.

7
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.001
GraphX uses a property graph model.

8
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:40.420
This means, both nodes.

9
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.500
And edges in a graph can
have attributes and values.

10
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.955
In GraphX, the node properties
are stored in a vertex table and

11
00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:57.330
edge properties are stored
in an edge table.

12
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.429
The connectivity information, that is,
which edge connects which nodes,

13
00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:08.501
is stored separately from the node and
edge properties.

14
00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:16.400
GraphX is built on special RDDs for
vertices and edges.

15
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.432
VertexRDD represents a set of vertices,

16
00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:28.823
all of which have an attribute called A.

17
00:01:28.823 --> 00:01:33.865
The EdgeRDD here extends
this basic edge storing by

18
00:01:33.865 --> 00:01:40.326
the edges in columnar format on
each partition for performance.

19
00:01:40.326 --> 00:01:46.740
Note that VertexID are defined
to be unique by design.

20
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.257
The edge class is an object
with a source vertex and

21
00:01:52.257 --> 00:01:56.209
destination vertex and an edge attribute.

22
00:01:58.257 --> 00:02:04.511
In addition to the vortex and
edge views of the property graph,

23
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.584
GraphX also has triplet view.

24
00:02:07.584 --> 00:02:14.350
The triplet view logically joins
vortex and edge properties.

25
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:21.131
GraphX has an operator that
can execute operations

26
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:24.880
from the Pregel library for
graph analytics.

27
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.000
This Pregel operator executes
in a series of super steps

28
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.700
which defines a messaging protocol for
vertices.

29
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.824
We will revisit graph analytics and

30
00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:43.946
using GraphX in more detail in
course five of the specialization.

31
00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:51.070
In summary, Spark can be used for
graph parallel computations.

32
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.740
GraphX uses special RDDs for
storing vertex and edge information.

33
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.165
And the pregel operator works
in a series of super steps.
