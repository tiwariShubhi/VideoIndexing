1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.650
There are many ways to
look at this process.

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.120
One way of looking at it
as two distinct activities.

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.000
Mainly, big data engineering and
big data analytics,

4
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.940
or computational big data
science as I like to call it,

5
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.890
since more than simple
analytics are being performed.

6
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.053
A more detailed way of looking at
the process reveals five listing steps or

7
00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:38.125
activities of the data science process,

8
00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:43.850
namely acquire, prepare,
analyze, report, and act.

9
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.900
We can simply say that data science
happens at the boundary of all the steps.

10
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.950
Ideally, this process should
support experimental work,

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.930
which is constantly iterated and
leads to more scientific exploration,

12
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.130
as well as producing actionable
results during these explorations

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.495
using dynamic scalability on big data and
cloud platforms.

14
00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:15.842
This five step process can be used in
alternative ways in real life big data

15
00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:20.685
applications if we add the dependencies
of different tools to each other.

16
00:01:22.325 --> 00:01:25.915
The influence of big data pushes for

17
00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:30.335
alternative scalability approaches
at each step of the process.

18
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.740
Acquire includes anything
that helps us retrieve data,

19
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.740
including finding, accessing,
acquiring, and moving data.

20
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:49.170
It includes identification of and
authenticated access to all related data,

21
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.490
as well as transportation of data
from sources to destinations.

22
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.760
It includes ways to subset and
match the data to regions or

23
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.350
times of interest, which we sometimes
refer to as geospatial querying.

24
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.234
We divide the prepare data
step into two sub-steps,

25
00:02:11.234 --> 00:02:14.070
based on the nature of the activity.

26
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.060
The first step in data preparation
involves exploring the data

27
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.690
to understand its nature,
what it means, its quality, and format.

28
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.550
It often takes a preliminary
analysis of data, or

29
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.670
samples of data, to understand it.

30
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.770
This is why this primary
step is called prepare.

31
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.990
Once we know more about the data
through exploratory analysis,

32
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.420
the next step is pre-processing
of data for analysis.

33
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.690
It includes cleaning data,
subsetting, or filtering data, and

34
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.600
creating data, which programs can read and
understand by modelling raw data

35
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.710
into a more defined data model, or
packaging it using a specific data format.

36
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.270
We will learn more about data models and
data formats later in this course.

37
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.780
If there are multiple data sets involved,

38
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.220
this step also includes integration
of different data sources or

39
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.745
streams, which is a topic we will
explore in our course three.

40
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.050
The prepared data then would be
passed on to the analysis step,

41
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.670
which involves selection of
analytical techniques to use,

42
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.840
building a model of the data,
and analyzing results.

43
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.520
This step can take a couple
of iterations on its own or

44
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.119
might require a data scientist
to go back to steps 1 and

45
00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.410
2 to get more data or
package data in a different way.

46
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.520
So, exploration never ends.

47
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.413
Step 4 for communicating results includes
evaluation of analytical results,

48
00:04:02.413 --> 00:04:07.464
presenting them in a visual way,
creating reports that include

49
00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:12.250
an assessment of results with
respect to success criteria.

50
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.293
Activities in this step can often be
referred to with terms like interpret,

51
00:04:19.293 --> 00:04:23.720
summarize, visualize, and post-process.

52
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.880
The last step brings us back to the very
first reason we do data science,

53
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.550
for a purpose.

54
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.140
Reporting insights from analysis and
determining actions from insights based

55
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.267
on the purpose you initially defined
is what we refer to as the act step.

56
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.140
We have now seen all of the steps
in a typical data science process.

57
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.750
Please note that this is an iterative
process and findings from

58
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.310
one step may require previous steps
to be repeated, but need information,

59
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.250
leading for further exploration and
application of these steps.

60
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.230
Scalability of this process to big
data analysis requires the use of

61
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.099
big data platforms like Hadoop.
