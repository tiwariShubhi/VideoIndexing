00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.473
What is a data stream?

2
00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:05.913
After this video,

3
00:00:05.913 --> 00:00:11.323
you will be able to summarize the key
characteristics of a data stream.

4
00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:16.263
Identify the requirements of
streaming data systems, and

5
00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:20.323
recognize the data streams
you use in your life.

6
00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:23.262
When we talked about how
big data is generated and

7
00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:26.640
the characteristics of the big
data using sound waves.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.460
One of the challenges we mentioned was the
velocity of data coming in varying rates.

9
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.360
For some applications this
presents the need to process data

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.540
as it is generated, or
in other words, as it streams.

11
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.770
We call these types of applications
Streaming Data Processing Applications.

12
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.630
This terminology refers to a constant
stream of data flowing from a source,

13
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.380
for example data from a sensory machine or
data from social media.

14
00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:07.149
An example application would be making
data-driven marketing decisions in

15
00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:08.390
real time.

16
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.790
Through the use of data from
real-time sales trends,

17
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.670
social media analysis,
and sales distributions.

18
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.070
Another example for streaming data
processing is monitoring of industrial or

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.250
farming machinery in real time.

20
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.075
For monitoring and
detection of potential system failures.

21
00:01:30.075 --> 00:01:32.837
In fact, any sensor network or

22
00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:38.576
internet of things environment
controlled by another entity,

23
00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:42.733
or set of entities falls
under this category.

24
00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:46.304
For example,
as you have seen in an earlier video,

25
00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:48.640
FlightStats is an application.

26
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.942
That processes about 60
million weekly flight events

27
00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:56.610
that come into their
data acquisition system.

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.978
And turns it into real-time
intelligence for airlines and

29
00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:04.480
millions of travelers
around the world daily.

30
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.180
So, how then do we define a data stream?

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.268
A stream is defined as
a possibly unbounded sequence of

32
00:02:17.268 --> 00:02:19.433
data items or records.

33
00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:25.880
That may or may not be related to,
or correlated with each other.

34
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.952
Each data is generally timestamped and

35
00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:34.670
in some cases geo-tagged.

36
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.063
As you have seen in our examples,
the data can stream from many sources.

37
00:02:39.063 --> 00:02:44.403
Including instruments, and
many internet of things application areas,

38
00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:48.480
computer programs, websites,
or social media posts.

39
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.360
Streaming data sometimes get
referred to as event data as

40
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.940
each data item is treated as an individual
event in a synchronized sequence.

41
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.070
Streams pose very difficult challenges for

42
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.940
conventional data
management architectures.

43
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.860
Which are built primarily on the concept
of persistence, static data collections.

44
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.219
Due to the fact that most often we
have only one chance to look at and

45
00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.643
process streaming data
before more gets piled on.

46
00:03:21.643 --> 00:03:26.597
Streaming data management systems cannot
be separated from real-time processing

47
00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:27.160
of data.

48
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.160
Managing and

49
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.030
processing data in motion is a typical
capability of streaming data systems.

50
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.791
However, the sheer size, variety and

51
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:43.305
velocity of big data adds further
challenges to these systems.

52
00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:49.260
Such systems are designed to manage
relatively simple computations.

53
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.640
Such as one record at a time or

54
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.070
a set of objects in a short time
window of the most recent data.

55
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.090
The computations are done
in near-real-time,

56
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.910
sometimes in memory, and
as independent computations.

57
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.099
The processing components
often subscribe to a system,

58
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.074
or a stream source, non-interactively.

59
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.580
This means they sent nothing
back to the source, nor

60
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.710
did they establish
interaction with the source.

61
00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:35.133
The concept of dynamic steering involves
dynamically changing the next steps or

62
00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:38.345
direction of an application
through a continuous

63
00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:41.110
computational process using streaming.

64
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.817
Dynamic steering is often a part of
streaming data management and processing.

65
00:04:48.817 --> 00:04:55.280
A self-driving car is a perfect example
of a dynamic steering application.

66
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.330
But all streaming data applications
fall into this category.

67
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.585
Such as the online gaming example we
discussed earlier in this course.

68
00:05:04.585 --> 00:05:08.893
Amazon Kinesis an other open-source Apache

69
00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:13.993
projects like Storm, Flink,
Spark Streaming, and

70
00:05:13.993 --> 00:05:18.880
Samza are examples of big
data streaming systems.

71
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.770
Many other companies also
provide streaming systems for

72
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.920
big data that are frequently
updated in response

73
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.280
to the rapidly changing
nature of these technologies.

74
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.300
As a summary, dynamic near-real-time
streaming data management,

75
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.640
processing, and steering is an important
part of today's big data applications.

76
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.590
Next, we will look at some
of the challenges for

77
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.830
streaming data management and processing.
