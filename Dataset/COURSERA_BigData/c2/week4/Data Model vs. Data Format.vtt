00:00:01.646 --> 00:00:06.170
In our experience as educators
we have observed that

2
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.940
learners often make the assumption
that the format of the data

3
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.820
is the same as the logical model of the
data in the way that you operate on it.

4
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.740
The goal of this very
short lecture is to ensure

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.590
that we can clearly
distinguish between the two.

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.550
So, after watching this video you will be
able to explain the difference between

7
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.460
format, which is a serialized
representation of the data, as opposed to

8
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.010
data model which we have discussed
at length in the previous months.

9
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.050
Perhaps the simplest example of a data
format is a csv file, so here is

10
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.359
a snippet of a csv file from the global
terrorism database we discussed earlier.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.520
We know that CSV or
common separative values means

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.910
that the term between two commas
is the value of an attribute.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.740
But what is this value?

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.110
The common notion is that it's
a content of a single relation

15
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.870
where each line is a record
that's a tuple and

16
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.030
the iod value in the CSV corresponds
to the iod attribute as shown here.

17
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.850
Now that might very well be true but
let's look at a different example.

18
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.440
Let's say this snippet
here is my CSV file.

19
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.960
There is no difference between
the previous file and this one.

20
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.780
However, here is how I
like to see the data.

21
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.600
As you can see this is a graph,

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.190
and the data model is the same
although the format is still CSV.
