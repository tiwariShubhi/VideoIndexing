00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:05.080
Now that we are familiar with some
commonly use terms to describe data,

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.010
let's look at what data exploration is and
why it's important.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.610
After this video,
you will be able to explain why data

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.760
exploration is necessary, articulate
the objectives of data exploration,

5
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.920
list the categories of techniques for
exploring data.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.160
Data exploration means
doing some preliminary

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.300
investigation of your data set.

8
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.860
The goal is to gain a better understanding
of the data that you have to work with.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.120
If you understand the characteristics of
your data, you can make optimal use of it

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.320
in whatever subsequent processing and
analysis you do with the data.

11
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.730
Note that data exploration is also
called exploratory data analysis, or

12
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.470
EDA for short.

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.780
How do you go about exploring data?

14
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.150
There are two main categories of
techniques to explore your data,

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.130
one based on summary statistics and
the other based on visualization methods.

16
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.580
Summary statistics provide important
information that summarizes a set

17
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.120
of data values.

18
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.050
There are many such statistics.

19
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.470
Many of them you have
probably heard of before,

20
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.560
such as mean, median,
and standard deviation.

21
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.602
These are some very commonly
used summary statistics.

22
00:01:18.602 --> 00:01:22.780
A summary statistic provides a single
quantity that summarizes some aspects of

23
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.090
the dataset.

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.200
For example, the mean, is a single
value that describes the average value

25
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.630
of the dataset,
no matter how large that dataset is.

26
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.140
You can think of the mean as an indicator
of where your dataset is centrally located

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.720
on a number line, thus summary
statistics provide a simple and

28
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.285
quick way to summarize a dataset.

29
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.000
Data visualization techniques allow
you to look at your data, graphically.

30
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.540
There are several types of plots that
you can use to visualize your data.

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.790
Some examples are histogram,
line plot, and scatter plot.

32
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.590
Each type of plot serves a different
purpose, we will cover the use of plots to

33
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.710
visualize your data in
an upcoming lecture.

34
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.110
What should you look for
when exploring your data?

35
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.910
You use statistics and
visual methods to summarize and

36
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.240
describe your dataset, and
some of the things you'll want to look for

37
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.430
are correlations,
general trends and outliers.

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.940
Correlations provide information
about the relation took between

39
00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.760
variables in your data.

40
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.220
By looking at correlations,

41
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.200
you may be able to determine that
two variables are very correlated.

42
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.500
This means they provide the same or
similar information about your data.

43
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.440
Since this contain redundant information,
this suggest that you may want to

44
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.220
remove one of the variables
to make the analysis simpler.

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.690
Trends in your data will reveal
characteristics in your data.

46
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.940
For example, you can see where
the majority of the data values lie,

47
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.220
whether your data is skilled or

48
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.585
not, what the most frequent value or
values are in a date set, etc.

49
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.660
Looking at trends in your data can also
reveal that a variable is moving in

50
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.380
a certain direction, such as sales revenue
increasing or decreasing over the years.

51
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.954
Calculating the minimum, the maximum and

52
00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:12.910
range of the data values are basic
steps in exploring your data.

53
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.450
Determining outliers is
a also very important.

54
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.340
Outliers indicate potential
problems with the data and

55
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.560
may need to be eliminated
in some applications.

56
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.830
In other applications,

57
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.560
outliers represent interesting data points
that should be looked at more closely.

58
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.680
In either case, outliers usually
require further examination.

59
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.600
In summary, what you get by exploring
your data is a better understanding of

60
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.826
the complexity of the data so
you can work with it more effectively.

61
00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:44.560
Better understanding in turn will
guide the rest of the process and

62
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200
lead to more informed analysis.

63
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.450
Summary statistics and

64
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.190
visualization techniques
are essential in exploring your data.

65
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.330
This should be used together
to examined a dataset.

66
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.523
In the next two lectures,

67
00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:59.895
we will look at a specific methods that
you can apply to explore your data.
