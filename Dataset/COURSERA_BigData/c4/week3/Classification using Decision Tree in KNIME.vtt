1
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.850
In this activity, we will be
performing classification in KNIME,

2
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.830
first we will create a new workflow and
import our weather data.

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.990
Next, we will remove the missing data and
then create a categorical value for

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.260
the humidity measurements.

5
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.490
We will then examine summary
statistics of the data before and

6
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.710
after the missing data was removed, and
finally build a decision tree workflow.

7
00:00:30.203 --> 00:00:31.570
Let's begin.

8
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.450
First, let's create a New Workflow.

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.990
We'll call it Classification.

10
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.010
Next, we'll import the daily weather data,
using the File Reader node.

11
00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:56.429
Configure the file reader node,
to use daily_weather.csv.

12
00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.250
Next, we'll add a missing value node,

13
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.020
to remove the missing values
in the daily weather data.

14
00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:13.480
We'll configure missing value to
remove all the missing values.

15
00:01:21.112 --> 00:01:26.072
Next we'll use a numeric binner node
to create a categorical variable for

16
00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:27.595
the humidity at 3pm.

17
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.530
We'll add the numeric binner node,
we'll connect it to missing value.

18
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.170
We'll select the relative
humidity 3pm column.

19
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.144
We'll create two bins,
the first bin we'll call humidity_low.

20
00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:51.450
And that value will go up to 25.

21
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.885
The second bin, we'll

22
00:01:56.885 --> 00:02:03.411
call humidity_not_low.

23
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.274
We'll check the Append new column and

24
00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:10.045
we'll call the new
column low_humidity_day.

25
00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:23.435
Next, we'll examine some summary
statistics, both before, and

26
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.940
after we've removed the missing values.

27
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.649
We'll add the statistics
node to the canvas.

28
00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:38.130
We'll connect the first one to
the output of the File Reader actor.

29
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.590
We'll add another one to
the output of Numeric Binner.

30
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.540
We'll change the name of the first
one to be BEFORE filtering.

31
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.660
And change the name of the second
one to AFTER filtering.

32
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.650
Lets configure the first one.

33
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.114
We'll change the maximum number of
possible values per column to 1500.

34
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.090
We'll also add all the columns.

35
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.670
Let's configure the second statistics now.

36
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.210
Again, we'll change the maximum number of
possible values per column to 1500, and

37
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.950
we'll add all the columns.

38
00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:30.360
Now let's run our workflow.

39
00:03:34.983 --> 00:03:38.680
Let's view both Statistic
nodes to compare the outputs.

40
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:47.240
In the BEFORE filtering statistics,
we can see that there are missing values.

41
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.519
However, there are no missing values
in the AFTER filtering statistics.

42
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.050
We can also compare the summary
statistics, for different measurements,

43
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.450
to see that they are similar values.

44
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.810
For example,
let's take a look at air_temp_9am.

45
00:04:18.505 --> 00:04:21.065
We could see that most of
the statistics are the same.

46
00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:24.325
As well as the distribution of values.

47
00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:30.210
In the AFTER filtering statistics,
click on the Nominal tab,

48
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.610
and we'll look at the low humidity
day categorical variable we created.

49
00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:47.719
We can see that the samples are equally
distributed between the two values.

50
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.290
Let's close these Statistics views.

51
00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.720
Next, let's add a Column Filter node.

52
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.441
We'll connect this to
the output of Numeric Binner.

53
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:09.390
Double-click to configure the node.

54
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.141
And we will exclude
relative_humidity_9am and

55
00:05:15.141 --> 00:05:20.770
relative_humidity_3pm columns, click OK.

56
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.329
Next, we'll add a Color Manager
node to the canvas.

57
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.850
Will connect this to the output of Column
Filter, double-click to configure it.

58
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:42.450
We will make sure the humidly_low is red,
and humidity_not_low is blue.

59
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.317
Click OK to close.

60
00:05:44.317 --> 00:05:49.710
Next, we'll add the Partitioning
node to the campus.

61
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.800
We'll connect this to
the output of Color Manager.

62
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.990
Double-click to configure.

63
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.060
We want to split the data
into two partitions.

64
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.920
The first partition should
have 80% of the data.

65
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.890
The second partition should have 20%.

66
00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.560
To do this click on Relative[%] and
change this to 80.

67
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.870
We'll make sure Draw randomly is selected.

68
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.390
And check Use random seed and
change the seed to 12345.

69
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.700
Normally we would not
specific the random seed.

70
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.040
However, since we want repeatable results,
we use a specific seed value here.

71
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.520
Click OK to continue.

72
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.770
Next, we'll add a Decision Tree Learner
to the work flow.

73
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.950
We'll connect this to the top
output of the Partitioning node.

74
00:06:47.248 --> 00:06:50.580
Double-click to configure, and

75
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.090
change the Min number of
records per node to 20.

76
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.480
Click OK.

77
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:03.410
Next, we'll add a Decision Tree Predictor
node to the canvas, and we will connect

78
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.310
the bottom output of Partitioning to
the bottom input of the predictor.

79
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.760
Next we'll connect the output
of Decision Tree Learner

80
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.420
to the top input of
Decision Tree Predictor.

81
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.190
Now let's execute our workflow.

82
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.000
We can view the resulting
classification rules

83
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.190
by right clicking on
Decision Tree Predictor.

84
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:32.040
And choosing either View: Decision Tree
View or View: Decision Tree View (simple).

85
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.610
Let's do the first one.

86
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.100
This shows the first two
splits in our decision tree.

87
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.300
We can expand each branch
by clicking on the plus.

88
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.343
Let's close this.

89
00:07:43.343 --> 00:07:47.910
Now let's look at the simplified view.

90
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.160
Again, we can expand the branches to
see the splits in the Decision Tree.

91
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.250
Close this,
finally let's save this workflow.

92
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:05.150
We'll analyze the results of the Decision
Tree model in the next KNIME Hands On.

93
00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.388
Save the workflow by
clicking on the disk icon.
