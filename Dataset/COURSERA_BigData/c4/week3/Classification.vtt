00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.410
Welcome back, we already discussing
Classification models and techniques for

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.030
next few lectures.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.450
Let's first define what
the classification task is,

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.720
after this video you will be able
to define what classification is.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.040
Explain whether classification is
supervised or unsupervised and

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.660
describe how binomial classification
differs from multinomial classification.

7
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.780
Classification is one type of
machine learning problems.

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.340
In the classification problem, the input
data is presented to the machine learning

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.620
model and the task is to predict the
target corresponding to the input data.

10
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.530
The target is a categorical variable,
so the classification task is

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.850
to predict the category or
label of the target given the input data.

12
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.870
For example, the classification
problem illustrated in this image

13
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.660
is to predict the type of weather.

14
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.540
The target that the model has to predict
is the weather and the possible values for

15
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.490
weather in this case is Sunny,
Windy, Rainy, or Cloudy.

16
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.127
The input data can consist of measurements
like temperature, relative humidity,

17
00:01:12.127 --> 00:01:16.380
atmospheric pressure,
wind speed, wind direction, etc.

18
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.640
So, given specific values for temperature,
relative humidity, atmospheric pressure,

19
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.570
etc., the task for the model is to
predict if the weather will be sunny.

20
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.370
Windy, rainy, or cloudy for the day,

21
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.530
this is what the data set might look like
for the weather classification problem.

22
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.540
Each row is a sample with input
variables temperature, humidity, and

23
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.980
pressure and target variable weather.

24
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.580
Each row has specific values for
the input variables and

25
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.970
a corresponding value for
the target variable.

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.580
The classification task is to predict
the value of the target variable

27
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.389
from the values of the input variables.

28
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.950
Since a target is provided,
we have labeled data and so

29
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.470
classification is a supervised task.

30
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.680
Recall that in a supervised task,
the target or

31
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.170
desired output for each sample is given.

32
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.440
Note that the target variable goes
by many names such as target,

33
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.170
label, output, class variable,
category, and class.

34
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.050
A classification problem can be binary or
multi-class with binary

35
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.520
classification the target variable has two
possible values, for example yes and no.

36
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.500
With multi-class classification
the target variable has more than

37
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.320
two possible values.

38
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.425
For example, the target can be short,
medium and tall.

39
00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:51.805
Multi-class classification is
also referred to multinomial or

40
00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:53.200
multi-label classification.

41
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.600
Remember though that the target is always
a categorical variable in classification.

42
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.270
Some examples of binary
classification are predicting

43
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.380
whether it will rain tomorrow or not,
here there are two possible outcomes,

44
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.450
yes it will rain tomorrow or
no, it will not rain tomorrow.

45
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.360
Identifying whether a credit card
transaction is legitimate or fraudulent,

46
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.660
again, there are only two possible values
for the target, legitimate or fraudulent.

47
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.780
Some examples of multi-class
classification include

48
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.610
predicting what type of product
that a customer will buy.

49
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.540
The possible values for
the target variables would be product

50
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.960
categories such as kitchen,
electronics, clothes, etc.

51
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.580
There is more than one
category of products, so

52
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.210
this is a multi-class
classification problem.

53
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.530
Another example is categorizing a tweet
as having a positive, negative, or

54
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.090
neutral sentiment, again,
the number of possible values for

55
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.830
the target is more than two here.

56
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.250
So, this is also a multi-class
classification task

57
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.330
to summarize in classification,

58
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.770
the model has to predict the category
corresponding to the input data.

59
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.870
Since the target is provided for each
sample, classification is a supervised

60
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.519
task, the target variable is always
categorical in classification.
