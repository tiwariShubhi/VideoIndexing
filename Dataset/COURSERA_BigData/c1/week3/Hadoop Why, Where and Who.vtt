1
00:00:02.022 --> 00:00:03.322
Getting started.

2
00:00:03.322 --> 00:00:05.063
Why Hadoop?

3
00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:07.254
We have all heard that Hadoop and

4
00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:12.150
related projects in this
ecosystem are great for big data.

5
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.332
This module will answer the four Ws and
an H about why this statement is true.

6
00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:33.788
Before we dive further into
the details of Hadoop,

7
00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:38.890
let's take a moment to analyze the
characteristics of the Hadoop ecosystem.

8
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.680
What's in the ecosystem?

9
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.890
Why is it beneficial?

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.040
Where is it used?

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.130
Who uses it?

12
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.740
And how do these tools work?

13
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.642
The Hadoop ecosystem frameworks and
applications that we will describe in this

14
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.670
module have several overarching themes and
goals.

15
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.930
First, they provide scalability
to store large volumes of data

16
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.180
on commodity hardware.

17
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.820
As the number of systems increases,
so does the chance for crashes and

18
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.510
hardware failures.

19
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.570
A second goal, supported by most
frameworks in the Hadoop ecosystem,

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.590
is the ability to gracefully
recover from these problems.

21
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.070
In addition, as we have mentioned before,
big data comes in

22
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.560
a variety of flavors, such as text files,
graph of social networks,

23
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.681
streaming sensor data and raster images.

24
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.250
A third goal for
the Hadoop ecosystem then,

25
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.920
is the ability to handle these different
data types for any given type of data.

26
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.590
You can find several projects in
the ecosystem that support it.

27
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.890
A fourth goal of the Hadoop ecosystem

28
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.998
is the ability to facilitate
a shared environment.

29
00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:15.030
Since even modest-sized
clusters can have many cores,

30
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.640
it is important to allow multiple
jobs to execute simultaneously.

31
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.450
Why buy servers only to let them sit idle?

32
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.750
Another goal of the Hadoop ecosystem
is providing value for your enterprise.

33
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.630
The ecosystem includes a wide
range of open source projects

34
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.270
backed by a large active community.

35
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.500
These projects are free to use and
easy to find support for.

36
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.750
In the following lectures in this module,

37
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.260
we will take a more detailed
look at the Hadoop ecosystem.

38
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.590
First, we will explore the kinds
of projects available and

39
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.760
the types of capabilities they provide.

40
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.300
Next we will take a deeper look at
the three main parts of Hadoop.

41
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.130
The Hadoop distributed file system,
or HDFS.

42
00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.910
YARN, the scheduler and resource manager.

43
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.400
And MapReduce, a programming model for
processing big data.

44
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.060
We will then discuss cloud computing, and
the types of service models it provides.

45
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.865
We will also describe situations in
which Hadoop is not the best solution.

46
00:03:36.935 --> 00:03:40.945
This module then concludes with
two readings involving hands-on

47
00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:44.245
experience with HDFS and MapReduce.

48
00:03:44.245 --> 00:03:45.325
So let's get started.
