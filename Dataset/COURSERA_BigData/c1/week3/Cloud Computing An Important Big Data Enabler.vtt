00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.918
Cloud Computing: An Important
Big Data Enabler.

2
00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:25.586
In our first lecture in this course,
we mentioned the cloud as one of

3
00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:29.450
the two influences of
the launch of the big data era.

4
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.050
We called it on-demand computing, and

5
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.390
we said that it enables us to
compute any time any anywhere.

6
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.110
Simply, whenever we demand it.

7
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.540
In this video,

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.260
we will see how we deploy the cloud to
our benefit in our big data applications.

9
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.990
The main idea behind cloud computing

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.340
is to transform computing
infrastructure into a commodity.

11
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.220
So application developers can focus on
solving application-specific challenges

12
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.880
instead of trying to build
infrastructure to run on.

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.760
So how does this happen?

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.840
We can simply define
a cloud computing service,

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.390
as a rental service for computing.

16
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.700
You rent what you want,
and return upon usage.

17
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.650
Think about this, you wouldn't buy, or

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.950
even build, a truck every time you
have to move a piece of furniture.

19
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.880
You would simply rent.

20
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.750
Why build a computing
cluster when you can rent?

21
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.930
Especially if you are not
using it all the time.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.900
Similarly, you can rent a car or
a bike when you are on vacation.

23
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.035
So you can bike anytime, anywhere.

24
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.970
Let's dig into this question.

25
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.240
What factors do you consider when you're
developing a solution for your yourself or

26
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.800
your client?

27
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880
Should you build a hardware and
software resources yourself?

28
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.090
Or should you rent these
resources from the cloud?

29
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.390
Let's look at in-house hardware and
software resource building first.

30
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.975
If you choose to develop in-house
capabilities, you have to hire people and

31
00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.630
buy hardware that suits your requirements.

32
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.750
These includes, but not limited to,
buying networking hardware,

33
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.040
storage disks, upgrading hardware
when it becomes obsolete, and so on.

34
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.360
Not to forget, the real estate
cost of keeping the hardware.

35
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.190
How do you estimate the size
of your hardware needs?

36
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.910
Do you make a five year estimate,
or ten year?

37
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.110
In today's fast changing world,

38
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.620
it is becoming harder to
estimate future demands.

39
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.220
Getting the software that fits
your needs is equally challenging.

40
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.700
Most software installations
require a lot of tweaking and

41
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.030
manual intervention that
require a lot of skills.

42
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.025
You will need your engineers to do this.

43
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:05.300
Compatibility issues bring
problems that are hard to foresee.

44
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.750
Most software is updated on a daily basis.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.210
You must ensure you're updated.

46
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.870
This insures you avoid security risks and
get the best.

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.770
Over all, building your own data center or
computing power house can be expensive.

48
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.200
And it can be time consuming,
maintaining it is a task by itself.

49
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.760
This requires high initial
capital investments and

50
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.380
efficient operation of several
departments in your business,

51
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.540
which you might not have if
you are a startup company.

52
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.800
Most people forget to include
the cost of disposing old hardware.

53
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.788
Now lets see what the cloud can do for us.

54
00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:55.660
Cloud's benefits are similar to what you
would get from a rental car company.

55
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.720
You pay for what you use,
which means a low capital investment.

56
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.680
You don't need to go to the dealership,
do a negotiation, get a bank loan,

57
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.420
get insurance.

58
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.680
That means quick implementation
of your projects.

59
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.350
Just like you don't need to buy
a car if you only need a car for

60
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.200
a limited use, deploying your application
on a server that is geographically

61
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.200
closer to your client can give you
fast service and happy customers.

62
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.430
For startup and small business,
it can be challenging to do so.

63
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.620
Cloud lets you do this with a click.

64
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.950
You can be sitting at a coffeeshop or your
home and starting your Internet business,

65
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.700
without a huge capital investment,
thanks to the cloud.

66
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.230
And you don't need to have a five or
ten year resource estimation plan.

67
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.527
Adapt to your requirements faster if
your business is growing faster than you

68
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:56.130
thought.

69
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.330
Cloud lets you forget about
the resource management problems and

70
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.310
lets you focus on your business's products
or domain expertise with minimal cost.

71
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.500
Just as you can rent a truck or
a convertible at a rental car company,

72
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.520
you can build your own
custom machine on cloud.

73
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.430
With a custom machine,
we mean a commodity cluster

74
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.940
made out of the right type of
computing nodes for your application.

75
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.930
You pick not only a CPU or a GPU, but

76
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.420
pick from a whole menu of compute,
memory and storage choices.

77
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.590
It's a buffet on the cloud.

78
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.900
Design machines to suit your application
requirements, data size and analytics.

79
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.740
Get what you want, and
pay for what you use.

80
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.380
Compare this with buying and

81
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.980
maintaining all combinations of
hardware that you possibly would use.

82
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.860
That is so costly and
not possible at all times.

83
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.710
Thanks to all these advantages, there
are many cloud server providers today.

84
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.990
And the numbers are growing.

85
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.820
Here we list some of the players
in the cloud computing market.

86
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.940
Take a moment to look at them.

87
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.990
You will probably recognize
some big names and

88
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.730
some others you have not
even heard of before.

89
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.670
As a summary, cloud does the heavy
lifting, so your team can extract

90
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.300
value from data with getting bogged
down in the infrastructure details.

91
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.680
Cloud provides convenient and

92
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.485
viable solutions for scaling your
prototype to a full fledged application.

93
00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:43.400
You can leverage the experts
to handle security,

94
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.450
robustness, and
let them handle the technical issues.

95
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.560
Your team can work on
utilizing your strengths

96
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.320
to solve your domain specific problem.
