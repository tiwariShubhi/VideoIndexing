00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.160
Generating value from Hadoop and

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.996
Pre-Built Hadoop Images that
come as off the shelf products.

3
00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:23.922
Assembling your own software stack
from scratch can be messy and

4
00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:26.298
a lot of work for beginners.

5
00:00:26.298 --> 00:00:31.661
The task of setting up the whole stack
could consume a lot of project time and

6
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.550
man power, reducing time to deployment.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.490
Getting pre-built images is similar
to buying pre-assembled furniture.

8
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.701
You can obtain a ready to go software
stack which contains a pre-installed

9
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:51.510
operating system, required libraries and
application software.

10
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.380
It saves you from the trouble
of putting the different

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.090
parts together in the right orientation.

12
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.030
You can start using
the furniture right away.

13
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.620
Packaging of these pre-built
software images is enabled

14
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.420
by virtual machines using
virtualization software.

15
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.380
Without going into too much detail,
one of the benefits of virtualization

16
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.710
software is that it lets you run a ready
made software stack within minutes.

17
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390
Your software stack comes as a large file.

18
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.800
Virtualization software provides
a platform where your stack can run.

19
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.240
Many companies provide images for
their version of the Hadoop platform,

20
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.100
including a number of
tools of their choice.

21
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.570
Hortonworks is one of the companies that
provides a pre-built software stack for

22
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.370
both Mac and Windows platforms.

23
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.420
Cloudera is another company
that provides pre-installed and

24
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.120
assembled software stack images.

25
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.230
Cloudera image is what we will
be working with in this course.

26
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.020
Many other companies
provide similar images.

27
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.831
Additionally, lots of online tutorials for
beginners are on vendors websites for

28
00:02:04.831 --> 00:02:08.740
self-training of users
working with these images and

29
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.580
the open source tools they include.

30
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.200
Once you choose the vendor,
you can check out their website for

31
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.550
tutorials on how to get started quickly.

32
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.980
There are plenty of resources online for
that.

33
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.080
You can deploy pre-built
images over the Cloud.

34
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.490
This would further accelerate your
application deployment process.

35
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.170
It is always best to evaluate which
approach is most cost effective for

36
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.320
your business model and organization.

37
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.485
Companies such as Cloudera,
Hortonworks and others,

38
00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:49.090
provide step-by-step guides on how to
set up pre-built images on the Cloud.

39
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.460
As a summary, using pre-built software
packages have a number of benefits and

40
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.280
can significantly accelerate
your big data projects.

41
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.558
Even small teams can quickly prototype,
deploy and validate their project ideas.

42
00:03:06.558 --> 00:03:11.480
The developed analytical solutions
can be scaled to larger volumes and

43
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.560
increase velocities of
data in a matter of hours.

44
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.162
These companies also provide
Enterprise level solutions for large,

45
00:03:20.162 --> 00:03:21.837
full-fledged applications.

46
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.395
An added benefit is that there
are plenty of companies which provide

47
00:03:27.395 --> 00:03:29.250
ready-made solutions.

48
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:35.270
That means lots of choices for you to
pick the one most suited to your project.
