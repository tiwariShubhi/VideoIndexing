1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.650
Big data, generated by organizations,
structured but often siloed.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.930
The last type of big data we will discuss
is big data generated by organizations.

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.740
This type of data is the closest to
what most businesses currently have.

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.550
But it's considered a bit out of fashion,
or

5
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.180
traditional, compared to
other types of big data.

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.760
However, it is at least as important
as other types of big data.

7
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:51.350
So how do organizations produce data?

8
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.940
The answer to how
an organization generates data

9
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.260
is very unique to the organization and
context.

10
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.540
Each organization has distinct
operation practices and

11
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.860
business models, which result in
a variety of data generation platforms.

12
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.697
For example, the type and source of data
that a bank gets is very different from

13
00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:15.650
what a hardware equipment
manufacturer gets.

14
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.808
Some common types of organizational big
data come from commercial transactions,

15
00:01:23.808 --> 00:01:29.033
credit cards, government institutions,
e-commerce, banking or

16
00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:35.070
stock records, medical records, sensors,
transactions, clicks and so on.

17
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.930
Almost every event can
be potentially stored.

18
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.320
Organizations store this data for
current and

19
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.040
future use, as well as for
analysis of the past.

20
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.970
Let's say you're an organization
that collects sales transactions.

21
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.500
You can use this data for pattern
recognition to detect correlated products,

22
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.990
to estimate demand for
products likely to go up in sales, and

23
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.780
capture fraudulent activity.

24
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.560
Moreover, when you know your
sales record and can correlate it

25
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.370
with your marketing records, you can find
which campaigns really made an impact.

26
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.340
You are already becoming
a data savvy organization.

27
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.180
Now think of bringing your
sales data together with other

28
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.680
external open public data,
such as major world events in the news.

29
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.420
You can ask, was it savvy marketing or

30
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.310
a consequence of external events
that triggered your sales?

31
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.037
Using proper analytics,

32
00:02:45.037 --> 00:02:50.800
you can now build inventories to match
your predicted growth and demand.

33
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.060
In addition, organizations build and
apply processes to record and

34
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.310
monitor business events of interest,
such as registering a customer,

35
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.116
manufacturing a product or
taking an order.

36
00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:10.930
These processes collect
highly structured data

37
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.460
that include transactions,
reference tables, and

38
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.810
relationships, as well as
the metadata that sets its context.

39
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.580
Usually, structured data is stored in
relational database management systems.

40
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.805
However, we call any data
that is in the form of

41
00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:36.708
a record located in a fixed field or
file structured data.

42
00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:40.300
This definition also
includes spreadsheets.

43
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.490
As I have mentioned before,
traditionally this type of

44
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.070
highly structured data is the vast
majority of what IT managed and

45
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.420
processed in both operational and
business intelligence systems.

46
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.410
Let's look at the sales transaction
data in our previous example.

47
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.575
If you look at the data in
the relational table on the right.

48
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:09.687
As the name structured suggests,

49
00:04:09.687 --> 00:04:14.649
the table is organized to store data using

50
00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:18.493
a structure defined by a model.

51
00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:24.450
Each column is tagged to tell us what
data that column intends to store.

52
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.950
This is what we call a data model.

53
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.680
A data model defines
each of these columns and

54
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.290
fields in the table, and
defines relationships between them.

55
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.960
If you look at the product ID column,
you will see that it includes only

56
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.940
identifiers that can potentially be linked
to another table defining these products.

57
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.990
The ability to define such relationships,
easily make structured data,

58
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.220
or in this case relational databases,
highly adopted by many organizations.

59
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.330
There are commonly used
languages like SQL,

60
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.600
the Structured Query Language, to extract
data of interest from such tables.

61
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.800
This is referred to as querying the data.

62
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.060
However, it could even be a challenge
to integrate such structured data.

63
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.460
This image shows us a continuum
of technologies to model,

64
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.880
collect and query unstructured
data coming from software and

65
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.180
hardware components
within an organization.

66
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.150
In the past, such challenges
led to information being stored

67
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.050
in what we call silos,
even within an organization.

68
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.700
Many organizations have traditionally
captured data at the department level,

69
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.950
without proper infrastructure and
policy to share and integrate this data.

70
00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.550
This has hindered the growth of
scalable pattern recognition

71
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.510
to the benefits of
the entire organization.

72
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.700
Because no one system has access to
all data that the organization owns.

73
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.080
Each data set is compartmentalized.

74
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.320
If such silos are left untouched,
organizations risk having outdated,

75
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.320
unsynchronized, and
even invisible data sets.

76
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:29.260
Organizations are realizing
the detrimental outcomes of this rigid

77
00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.820
structure.

78
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.270
And changing policies and infrastructure
to enable integrated processing of

79
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.025
all data to the entire
organization's benefit.

80
00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:44.090
Cloud-based solutions
are seen as agile and

81
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.550
low capital intensive
solutions in this area.

82
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:53.309
As a summary, while highly structured
organizational data is very useful and

83
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:57.671
trustworthy, and
thus a valuable source of information,

84
00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:01.860
organizations must pay special
attention to breaking up

85
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.243
the silos of information to
make full use of its potential.
