00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.970
As we have already seen, there are many
different exciting applications

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.060
that are being enabled
by the Big Data era.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.500
As part of my core research here at
the San Diego Supercomputer Center,

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.420
I work on building methodologies and

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.150
tools to make Big Data useful to dynamic
data driven scientific applications.

6
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.600
My colleagues and I work on many grand
challenge data science applications,

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.903
in all areas of science and engineering,
including genomics, geoinformatics,

8
00:00:30.903 --> 00:00:36.050
metro science, energy management,
biomedicine, and personalized health.

9
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.492
What is common to all these applications
is their unique way of bringing

10
00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:46.046
together new modes of data and
computing research.

11
00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:52.195
Let me tell you the one I'm passionate

12
00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:57.192
about, Wildfire Analytics,

13
00:00:57.192 --> 00:01:03.342
which breaks up into two components,

14
00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:07.779
prediction and response.

15
00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:21.629
Why is this so important?

16
00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:25.608
On May 2014, in San Diego County where

17
00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:30.804
the instructors of this
specialization live and work,

18
00:01:30.804 --> 00:01:36.330
there were 14 fires burning,
as many as nine at one time,

19
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.964
which burned a total of 26,000 acres,
11,000 hectares,

20
00:01:42.964 --> 00:01:48.520
an area just less than the size
of the City of San Francisco.

21
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.087
Six people were injured and
one person died.

22
00:01:56.087 --> 00:02:00.093
And these wildfires
resulted in a total cost of

23
00:02:00.093 --> 00:02:04.620
over $60 million US in damage and
firefighting.

24
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.925
These wildfires can become so severe
that we actually call them firestorms.

25
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.170
Although we cannot
control such fire storms,

26
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.070
something we can do is to get ahead
of them by predicting their behavior.

27
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.670
This is why disaster management
of ongoing wildfires relies

28
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.470
heavily on understanding their
direction and rate of spread.

29
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.000
As these fires are a part of our lives,

30
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.410
we wanted to see if we can use Big Data to
monitor, predict and manage a firestorm.

31
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.337
Why can Big Data help?

32
00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:46.685
As we will see in this video,
indeed, wildfire prevention and

33
00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:50.879
response can benefit from many
streams in our data torrent.

34
00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.087
Some streams are generated by
people through devices they carry.

35
00:02:56.087 --> 00:03:01.713
A lot come from sensors and satellites,
things that measure environmental factors.

36
00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:05.855
And some come from organizational data,
including area maps,

37
00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:10.839
better service updates and field content
databases, which archive how much

38
00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.991
registers vegetation and other types of
fuel are in the way of a potential fire.

39
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.337
What makes this a Big Data problem?

40
00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:25.233
Because novel approaches and
responses can be taken if

41
00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:29.712
we can integrate this many
diverse data streams.

42
00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:34.504
Many such data sources have already
existed for quite some time.

43
00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:39.835
But what is lacking in disaster
management today is a dynamic system

44
00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:44.979
integration of real time sensor networks,
satellite imagery,

45
00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:50.405
near real time data management tools,
wildfire simulation tools,

46
00:03:50.405 --> 00:03:54.334
connectivity to emergency command centers,
and

47
00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:58.470
all these before, during,
and after a firestorm.

48
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.450
As you will see,
the integration of diverse streams and

49
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.760
novel ways is really what's driving
our ability to see new things and

50
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.270
develop predictive analytics,
which may help improve our world.

51
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.140
What are these diverse sources?

52
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.870
One of the most important data sources
is sensor data streaming in from weather

53
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.540
stations and satellites,
such sensed data include temperature,

54
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.960
humidity, air pressure.

55
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.346
We can also include image
data streaming from

56
00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:38.379
mountaintop cameras and
satellites in this category.

57
00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.967
Another important data source
comes from institutions

58
00:04:41.967 --> 00:04:44.867
such as
the San Diego Supercomputer Center,

59
00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:48.250
which generate data related
to wildfire modeling.

60
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.585
These include past and current fire
perimeter maps put together by

61
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:58.824
the authorities and fuel maps that
tell us about the vegetation,

62
00:04:58.824 --> 00:05:02.171
and other types of fuel in a fire's path.

63
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:08.171
These types of data sources are often
static or updated at a slow rate,

64
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:14.083
but they provide valuable data
that is well-curated and verified.

65
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.450
A huge part of data on fires is
actually generated by the public

66
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.820
on social media sites such as Twitter,
which support photo sharing resources.

67
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.050
These are the hardest data sources to
streamline during an existing fire, but

68
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.340
they can be very valuable once
integrated with other data sources.

69
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.380
Imagine synthesizing all the pictures
on Twitter about an ongoing fire or

70
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.850
checking the public sentiment
around the boundaries of a fire.

71
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.710
Once you have access to such
information at your fingertips,

72
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.610
there are many things you
can do with such data.

73
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.300
You can simply monitor it, or
maybe you can visualize it.

74
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.370
But it's not until you bring all these
different types of data sources together

75
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.910
and integrate them with real time analysis
and predictive modeling that you can

76
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.570
really make contributions in predicting
and responding to wildfire emergencies.

77
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.221
So now,
I will like you to take a moment and

78
00:06:22.221 --> 00:06:27.296
imagine how Big Data might help
with firefighting in the future.

79
00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:32.280
All these streams of data will come
together in 3D displays that can show

80
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.182
all the related information along
with weather and fire predictions,

81
00:06:37.182 --> 00:06:40.462
just like the way tornadoes
are managed today.
