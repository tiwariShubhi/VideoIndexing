00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:04.788
Building a Big Data Strategy.

2
00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:29.760
Before we focus on big data strategy,
let's look at what strategy means.

3
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.090
Although it is associated
with a military term,

4
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.490
a dictionary search on strategy shows
the meaning as a plan of action or

5
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.820
policy designed to achieve a major or
overall aim.

6
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.990
This definition calls out the four major
parts that need to be in any strategy.

7
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.110
Namely, aim, policy, plan, and action.

8
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.620
Now, we are talking about
a big data strategy.

9
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.770
So what do these four terms mean for us?

10
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.382
When building our big data strategy,
we look at what we have,

11
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:15.793
what high level goals we want to achieve,
what we need to do to get there,

12
00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:20.878
and what are the policies around
data from the beginning to the end.

13
00:01:24.568 --> 00:01:29.210
A big data strategy starts
with big objectives.

14
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.939
Notice that I didn't say it
starts with collecting data

15
00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.171
because in this activity we
are really trying to identify what

16
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:44.118
data is useful and
why by focusing on what data to collect.

17
00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:48.410
Every organization or team is unique.

18
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.120
Different projects have
different objectives.

19
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.960
Hence, it's important to first
define what your team's goals are.

20
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.570
Have you ever had the scenario where you
see the temperature on the weather report

21
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.350
and someone else highlights
the humidity instead?

22
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.820
To find problems relevant to solve and

23
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.290
data related to it, it might be
useful to start with your objectives.

24
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.500
Once you define these objectives, or

25
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.030
more generally speaking, questions to turn
big data into advantage for your business,

26
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.450
you can look at what you have and
analyze the gaps and actions to get there.

27
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.192
It is important to focus
on both short term and

28
00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:33.108
long term objectives in this activity.

29
00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:37.791
These objectives should also be linked
to big data analytics with business

30
00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:38.720
objectives.

31
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.620
To make the best use of big data,
each company needs to evaluate how

32
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.220
data science or big data analytics would
add value to their business objectives.

33
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.730
Once you have established that
analytics can help your business,

34
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.550
you need to create
a culture to embrace it.

35
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.820
The first and foremost ingredient for

36
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.790
a successful data science program
is organizational buy-in.

37
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.810
A big data strategy must
have commitment and

38
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.010
sponsorship from the company's leadership.

39
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.930
Goals for using big data analytics should
be developed with all stakeholders and

40
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.640
clearly communicated to
everyone in the organization.

41
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.740
So that its value is understood and
appreciated by all.

42
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.790
The next step is to build
your data science team.

43
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.930
A diverse team with data scientists,
information technologists,

44
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.520
application developers, and business
owners is necessary to be effective.

45
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.830
As well as the mentality that everyone
works together as partners with

46
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.950
common goals.

47
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.970
Remember, one for all.

48
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.960
No one is a customer or
service provider of another.

49
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.360
Rather, everyone works together and
delivers as a team.

50
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.930
Since big data is a team game,
and multi-disciplinary,

51
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.180
a big part of a big data
strategy is constant training

52
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.400
of team members on new big data tools and
analytics.

53
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.050
As well as business practices and
objectives.

54
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.095
This becomes even more critical if your
business depends on deep expertise

55
00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:27.381
on one or more subject areas with subject
matter experts working on problems,

56
00:04:27.381 --> 00:04:28.838
utilizing big data.

57
00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:37.138
Such businesses might have subject matter
experts who can be trained to add big

58
00:04:37.138 --> 00:04:42.730
data skills, and provide more value added
support than a newcomer would have.

59
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.024
Similarly, any project member would
be trained to understand what

60
00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:50.564
the business objectives and
products are, and how he or

61
00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:55.478
she can utilize big data to improve those
objectives using his or her skills.

62
00:04:58.218 --> 00:05:04.186
Many organizations might benefit by having
a small data science team whose main job

63
00:05:04.186 --> 00:05:10.000
is do data experiments and test new ideas
before they get deployed at full scale.

64
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.200
They might come up with
a new idea themselves

65
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.990
based on the analysis they perform.

66
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.220
They take more research level role.

67
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.010
However, their findings can drastically
shape your business strategy

68
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.540
almost on a daily basis.

69
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.620
The impact of such teams
becomes evident over time

70
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.950
as other parts of your organization starts
to see the results of their finding and

71
00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.790
analysis affecting their strategies.

72
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.550
They become strategic partners of
all verticals in your business.

73
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.820
Once you see that something works,

74
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.210
you can start collecting more data to see
similar results at organizational scale.

75
00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.330
Since data is key to any big
data initiative, it is essential

76
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.870
that data across the organization
is easily accessed and integrated.

77
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.700
Data silos as you know, are like
a death knell on effective analytics.

78
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.470
So barriers to data
access must be removed.

79
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.430
Opening up the silos must be encouraged
and supported from the organization's

80
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.020
leaders in order to promote a data
sharing mindset for the company.

81
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.900
Another aspect of defining
your big data strategy

82
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.700
is defining the policies around big data.

83
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.190
Although it has an amazing amount
of potential for your business,

84
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.540
using big data should also raise some
concerns in long term planning for data.

85
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.270
Although this is a very complex issue,

86
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.230
here are some questions you should
think of addressing around policy.

87
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.350
What are the privacy concerns?

88
00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.770
Who should have access to,
or control data?

89
00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.190
What is the lifetime of data,
which is sometimes defined as volatility,

90
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.290
anatomy of big data?

91
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.890
How does data get curated and cleaned up?

92
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.320
What ensures data quality
in the long term?

93
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.530
How do different parts of your
organization communicate or

94
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.400
interoperate using this data?

95
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.070
Are there any legal and
regulatory standards in place?

96
00:07:28.295 --> 00:07:32.270
Cultivating an analytics
driven culture is crucial

97
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.600
to the success of a big data strategy.

98
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.690
The mindset that you want to
establish is that analytics

99
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.200
is an integral part of doing business,
not a separate afterthought.

100
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:50.170
Analytics activities must be tied
to your business objectives, and

101
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.480
you must be willing to use analytics
in driving business decisions.

102
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.598
Analytics and business together bring
about exciting opportunities and

103
00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:01.750
growth to your big data strategy.

104
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.570
Finally, one size does not fit all.

105
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.780
Hence, big data technologies and

106
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:15.490
analytics is growing rapidly as your
business is an evolving entity.

107
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:21.180
You have to iterate your strategy to
take advantage of new advances and

108
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.310
also make your business more
dynamic in the face of change.

109
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.380
As a summary,
when building a big data strategy,

110
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.130
it is important to integrate big data
analytics with business objectives.

111
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.450
Communicate goals and
provide organizational buy-in for

112
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.420
analytics projects.

113
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.990
Build teams with diverse talents,
and establish a teamwork mindset.

114
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.370
Remove barriers to data access and
integration.

115
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.160
Finally, these activities need to be
iterated to respond to new business

116
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.568
goals and technological advances.
