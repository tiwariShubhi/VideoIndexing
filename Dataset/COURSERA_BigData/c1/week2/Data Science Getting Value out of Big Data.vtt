00:00:02.826 --> 00:00:04.162
Data Science.

2
00:00:04.162 --> 00:00:06.298
Getting value out of big data.

3
00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:31.860
We have all heard data science turned
data into insights or even actions.

4
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.250
But what does that really mean?

5
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.990
Data science can be
thought of as a basis for

6
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.440
empirical research where data is used
to induce information for observations.

7
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.310
These observations are mainly data,
in our case,

8
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.985
big data, related to a business or
scientific case.

9
00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:54.430
Insight is a term

10
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.050
we use to refer to the data
products of data science.

11
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.523
It is extracted from a diverse amount
of data through a combination of

12
00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:07.686
exploratory data analysis and modeling.

13
00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:13.440
The questions are sometimes more specific,
and sometimes it requires

14
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.170
looking at the data and patterns in it
to come up with the specific question.

15
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.550
Another important point to recognize
is that data science is not static.

16
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.020
It is not one time analysis.

17
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.920
It involves a process where models
generated to lead to insights

18
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.630
are constantly improved through further
empirical evidence, or simply, data.

19
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.060
For example, a book retailer like
Amazon.com can constantly improve

20
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.560
the model of a customer's book preferences
using the customer demographic,

21
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.630
his or her previous purchases and
the book reviews of the customer.

22
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.350
The book retailer can also
uses information to predict

23
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.219
which customers are likely
to like any book,

24
00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.560
and take action to market
the book to those customers.

25
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.955
This is where we see insights
being turned into action.

26
00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:24.718
As we have seen in the book marketing
example, using data science and analysis

27
00:02:24.718 --> 00:02:29.240
of the past and current information,
data science generates actions.

28
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.200
This is not just an analysis of the past,
but

29
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.980
rather generation of actionable
information for the future.

30
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.070
This is what we can call a prediction,
like the weather forecast.

31
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.140
When you decide what to wear for
the day based on the forecast of the day,

32
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.880
you are taking action based
on insight delivered to you.

33
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.110
Just like this, business leaders and
decision makers

34
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.170
take action based on the evidence
provided by their data science teams.

35
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.870
We set data science teams.

36
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.290
This comes from the breadth of information
and skill that it takes to make it happen.

37
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.010
You have probably seen diagrams like
this one that describe data science.

38
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.220
Data science happens at
the intersection of computer science,

39
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.820
mathematics and business expertise.

40
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.750
If we zoom deeper into this diagram and

41
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.030
open the sets of expertise we will
see a variation of this figure.

42
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.690
Even at this level, all of these circles
require deeper knowledge and skills

43
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.140
in areas like domain expertise, data
engineering, statistics and computing.

44
00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:55.790
An even deeper analysis of these
skills will lead you to skills like

45
00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.110
machine learning, statistical modeling,
relational algebra,

46
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.640
business passion, problem solving and
data visualization.

47
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.582
That's a lot of skills to have for
a single person.

48
00:04:12.922 --> 00:04:17.862
These wide range of skills and
definitions of data scientists having them

49
00:04:17.862 --> 00:04:21.855
all led to discussions like
are data scientists unicorns?

50
00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.115
Meaning they don't exist.

51
00:04:25.375 --> 00:04:29.795
There are data science experts who have
expertise in more than one of these

52
00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:31.380
skills, for sure.

53
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.795
But they're relatively rare, and

54
00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:37.470
still would probably need help from
an expert on some of these areas.

55
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.550
So, in reality, data scientists
are teams of people who act like one.

56
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.860
They are passionate about the story and
the meaning behind data.

57
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.700
They understand they problem
they are trying to solve, and

58
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.910
aim to find the right analytical
methods to solve this problem.

59
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.350
And they all have an interest in
engineering solutions to solve problems.

60
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.360
They also have curiosity about each
others work, and have communication

61
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.940
skills to interact with the team and
present their ideas and results to others.

62
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.460
As a summary, a data science team often
comes together to analyze situations,

63
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.370
business or scientific cases, which none
of the individuals can solve on their own.

64
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.090
There are lots of moving
parts to the solution.

65
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.370
But in the end, all these parts
should come together to provide

66
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.055
actionable insight based on big data.

67
00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:46.732
Being able to use evidence-based
insight in business decisions is more

68
00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:48.517
important now than ever.

69
00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:52.594
Data scientists have a combination
of technical, business and

70
00:05:52.594 --> 00:05:54.716
soft skills to make this happen.
