00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:05.646
Step four, reporting insights.

2
00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:20.498
The fourth step in our data science
process is reporting the insights gained

3
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:21.800
from our analysis.

4
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.840
This is a very important step
to communicate your insights and

5
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320
make a case for
what actions should follow.

6
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.380
It can change shape based on your
audience and should not be taken lightly.

7
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.760
So how do you get started?

8
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.040
The first thing to do is to look
at your analysis results and

9
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.720
decide what to present or report as the
biggest value or biggest set of values.

10
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.530
In deciding what to present you
should ask yourself these questions.

11
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.740
What is the punchline?

12
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.330
In other words, what are the main results?

13
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.590
What added value do
these results provide or

14
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.870
how can the model add to the application?

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.840
How do the results compare to
the success criteria determined at

16
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.260
the beginning of the project?

17
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.220
Answers to these questions are the items
you need to include in your report or

18
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.990
presentation.

19
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.336
So make them the main topics and
gather facts to back them up.

20
00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:44.330
Keep in mind that not all of
your results may be rosy.

21
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.650
Your analysis may show results that are
counter to what you were hoping to find,

22
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.410
or results that are inconclusive or
puzzling.

23
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.530
You need to show these results as well.

24
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.950
Domain experts may find some of
these results to be puzzling, and

25
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.932
inconclusive findings may
lead to additional analysis.

26
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.920
Remember the point of
reporting your findings

27
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.410
is to determine what
the next step should be.

28
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.538
All findings must be presented so
that informed decisions can be made.

29
00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:29.180
Visualization is an important
tool in presenting your results.

30
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.400
The techniques that we discuss and
explore in data can be used here as well.

31
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.760
What were they?

32
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.690
Scatter plots, line graphs,
heat maps, and other types of graphs

33
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.390
are effective ways to present
your results visually.

34
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.150
This time you're not
plotting the input data, but

35
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.250
you're plotting the output
data with similar tools.

36
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.238
You should also have tables with
details from your analysis as backups,

37
00:03:01.238 --> 00:03:04.418
if someone wants to take
a deeper dive into the results.

38
00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:10.080
There are many visualization
tools that are available.

39
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.750
Some of the most popular open
source ones are listed here.

40
00:03:16.205 --> 00:03:20.370

45
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.820
producing interactive web based

Tableau Public Allows you
to create visualizations,

49
00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:07.916

50
00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:12.925
Google Charts provides
cross-browser compatibility,

51
00:04:12.925 --> 00:04:17.940
and closed platform portability
to iPhones and Android.

52
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.865
Timeline is a JavaScript library
that allows you to create timelines.

53
00:04:27.865 --> 00:04:33.787
In summary, you want to report your
findings by presenting your results and

54
00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:37.780
value add with graphs
using visualization tools.
