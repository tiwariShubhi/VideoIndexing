00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.360
Asking the Right Questions.

2
00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:23.810
The first step in any process is to define
what it is you are trying to tackle.

3
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.975
What is the problem that
needs to be addressed, or

4
00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.240
the opportunity that
needs to be ascertained.

5
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.223
Without this,
you won't have a clear goal in mind, or

6
00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:38.153
know when you've solved your problem.

7
00:00:38.153 --> 00:00:42.833
An example question is,
how can sales figures and

8
00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:48.072
call center logs be combined
to evaluate a new product,

9
00:00:48.072 --> 00:00:53.534
or in a manufacturing process,
how can data from multiple

10
00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:59.573
sensors in an instrument be used
to detect instrument failure?

11
00:00:59.573 --> 00:01:02.745
How can we understand our customers and

12
00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:07.273
market better to achieve
effective target marketing?

13
00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:11.320
Next you need to assess the situation
with respect to the problem or

14
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.730
the opportunity you have defined.

15
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.011
This is a step where you need to
exercise caution analyzing risks,

16
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.609
costs, benefits, contingencies,

17
00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:28.650
regulations, resources and
requirements of the situation.

18
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.910
What are the requirements of the problem?

19
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.850
What are the assumptions and constraints?

20
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.450
What resources are available?

21
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.614
This is in terms of both personnel and
capital,

22
00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:43.685
such as computer systems, instruments etc.

23
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:47.425
What are the main costs
associated with this project?

24
00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.335
What are the potential benefits?

25
00:01:49.335 --> 00:01:52.625
What risks are there in
pursuing the project?

26
00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:57.125
What are the contingencies to
potential risks, and so on?

27
00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:02.570
Answers to these questions will help you
get a better overview of the situation.

28
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.700
And better understanding of
what the project involves.

29
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.172
Then you need to define your goals and
objectives,

30
00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.813
based on the answers to these questions.

31
00:02:13.813 --> 00:02:17.850
Defining success criteria
is also very important.

32
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.770
What do you hope to achieve
by the end of this project?

33
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.368
Having clear goals and and

34
00:02:22.368 --> 00:02:28.280
success criteria will help you to assess
the project throughout its life cycle.

35
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.780
Once you know the problem you want to
address and understand the constraints and

36
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.990
goals, then you can formulate
the plan to come up with the answer,

37
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.330
that is the solution to
your business problem.

38
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.920
As a summary, defining the questions
you're looking to find answers for

39
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.250
is a huge factor contributing to
the success of a data science project.

40
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.830
By following the explained set of steps,
you can formulate better questions

41
00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.500
to solve using analytical skills and
link them to business value.
