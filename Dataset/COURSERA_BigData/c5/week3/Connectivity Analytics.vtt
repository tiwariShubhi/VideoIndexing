00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.640
In this video we will explore

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.040
another fundamental property
of graphs called Connectivity.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.350
We list two important kinds
of graph analytic questions

4
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.610
that are based on connectivity.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.380
In the first case we are asking
about the robustness of the network.

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.520
Suppose we have a computer
network with many servers and

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.330
a hacker is trying to
bring the system down,

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.190
you set a small set of servers that the
hacker can target to disrupt the network.

9
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.750
What we mean by disrupt is to disconnect
a part of the network from the rest.

10
00:00:37.262 --> 00:00:41.110
A similar problem may occur in
the power distribution network.

11
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.100
In that case, an attacker may be able to
attack one or two central components so

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700
that large portions of
the network loses power.

13
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.117
I have a geneticist colleague at
Tech Graduate Institute who studied

14
00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:56.460
the robustness of biological networks.

15
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.990
He told me that many biological
networks have built in redundancy, so

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.030
that even if you disrupt one important
gene, there are other genes in the network

17
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.580
which will support the biological
function, possibly through other routes.

18
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.940
Therefore a network is robust,
if removing one or

19
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.610
more edges or
nodes still keeps it connected.

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.720
The second category is about network
comparison in terms of their

21
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.630
overall connectivity.

22
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.060
The two graphs shown here are very
different in their structure.

23
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.920
What are some parameters by
which we can compare them?

24
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.540
That to talk about connectivity, we must
first define the concept of connectivity.

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.200
Very simple.

26
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.120
A graph is connected if we can
reach any node from any other node.

27
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.243
Let's look at the crypto graph in
the picture, clearly we cannot

28
00:01:57.243 --> 00:02:02.714
reach from all nodes to all nodes here
because this graph is not connected.

29
00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:08.850
However, we can identify four parts of
the graph that are themselves connected.

30
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.300
These islands of connected
parts are called components or

31
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.790
connected components of a graph.

32
00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:21.420
For directed graphs, we need to be
a little more specific about connectivity.

33
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.200
We say that the directed graph is strongly
connected, if we follow the direction of

34
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.690
the edges and still reach every
node from every other node.

35
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.640
A weaker form of connectivity is if we do
not care about the direction of the arrows

36
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.790
and can reach every node
from every other node.

37
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.430
Another way of saying it is that
the undirected version of the graph

38
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.760
is connected,
this is called Weak Connected.

39
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.300
Look at the graph that we have seen so
many times in this course.

40
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.994
Is it strongly connected or
weakly connected?

41
00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:10.070
This leads to some big graph challenge.

42
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.750
Given an arbitrarily large graph,

43
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.050
can I find the connected components
of the graph efficiently?

44
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.280
Second given an arbitrarily large graph,

45
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.970
can we find its sub graphs
that are strongly connected?

46
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.649
We'll touch upon these
questions in Module Four.
