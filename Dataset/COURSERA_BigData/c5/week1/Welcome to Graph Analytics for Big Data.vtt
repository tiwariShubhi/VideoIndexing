Hello.

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.750
Welcome to the Graph Analytics module
in the Big Data specialization.

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm Amarnath Gupta, a research scientist
at the San Diego Supercomputer Center.

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.080
What do I do research on?

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.380
Well, a number of different areas,
all generally related to data engineering.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740
But the area I'm recently very
excited about has to do with graphs.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.650
Now, graphs or
networks has many people call them,

8
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.270
are about studying relationships and
relationship patterns on objects.

9
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.420
I became interested in graphs
when I was a graduate student and

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.930
the professor in our artificial
intelligence class showed us how a part of

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.240
human knowledge can be represented as
a kind of graphs called semantic networks.

12
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.030
She showed us how even
very simple things like

13
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.840
relationships somewhere in a family can
be represented and viewed as graphs.

14
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.121
Represent your knowledge huh?

15
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:15.030
Now, that got me really excited.

16
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.042
Someday, I thought this will be a really
interesting topic to research on.

17
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.660
What I didn't realize then is that
in just a few years graphs and

18
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.787
the need to model and analyze them would
become so dominant in both academia and

19
00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:40.600
industry that graphs will
be found everywhere today.

20
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.520
Now we look at Facebook,
LinkedIn, Twitter, and many,

21
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.930
many more companies that
are thriving in the market with data

22
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.450
that are represented, modeled,
and processed as graphs.

23
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.210
Now, even the entire World Wide Web,
if you think about it,

24
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.140
is a giant graph that people analyze.

25
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.710
And that brings us to this course.

26
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.400
Now, in this course, I'll introduce you
to the wonderful world of Graph Analytics

27
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700
specifically, I'd like
to show how different

28
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.070
kinds of real world data science problems
can be viewed and modeled as graphs.

29
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.856
And how the process of solving
them can apply analytical

30
00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:29.710
techniques that used graph based methods,
that is Algorithms.

31
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.870
This course would have four models.

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.820
In model one, we'll introduce graphs and
different applications that use graphs.

33
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.880
In model two,
we'll cover a number of common techniques,

34
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.000
mathematical and algorithm techniques,
that are used in Graph Analytics.

35
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.264
In module three,
we'll look at a graph database.

36
00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.288
And through some sort
of a hands on guidance,

37
00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:04.840
we'll show you how to store and
query graph data with the database.

38
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.800
In module four, we'll cover some
strategies of handling very large

39
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.855
graphs and discuss how existing
tools that are currently used by

40
00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:21.625
the community are actually prints.

41
00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.585
Thank you for joining this course and

42
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:27.885
I sincerely hope that you'll find
it both exciting and useful.

43
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:29.884
Happy learning.
