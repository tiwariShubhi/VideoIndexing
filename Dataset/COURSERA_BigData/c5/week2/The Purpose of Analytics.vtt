00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.950
As we saw in these four examples
what graphs are used for

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.920
are kind of different but they all show

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.275
different viewpoints from which you
can use graphs for your analysis.

4
00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:16.380
Since this course focuses
on graph analytics,

5
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.150
I'd like to briefly recap
what the term means.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.790
Analytics is the ability to
discover meaningful patterns and

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.972
interesting insights into data using
mathematical properties of data.

8
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.260
It covers the process of computing
with mathematical properties, and

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.460
accessing the data itself efficiently.

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.970
Further, it involves
the ability to represent and

11
00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.910
work with domain knowledge as we
saw in use case two with biology.

12
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.220
Finally, analytics often involves
statistical modeling techniques for

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.180
drawing inferences and
making predictions on data.

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.110
With analytics, we should be able
to achieve the goals shown here.

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.977
Take a minute to read.

16
00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:15.180
Therefore, graph analytics is
a special case of analytics where

17
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.985
the underlying data can be
modeled as a set of graphs.
