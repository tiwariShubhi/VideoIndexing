00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.940
Next we'll import the BreezeViz library,
define a function to calculate the degree

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.810
histogram, calculate the probability
distribution for the degree histogram, and

3
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.500
graph the results.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.580
In this hands on exercise,
we will plot the degree histogram created

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.130
in the previous hands on exercise
using the BreezeViz library.

6
00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.742
Starting again where we left off
in the previous hands-on exercise,

7
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:30.880
ensure your is started.

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.170
First we will import
the BreezeViz library.

9
00:00:40.286 --> 00:00:44.958
Next, we will define a function to
calculate the degree histogram of Metro's

10
00:00:44.958 --> 00:00:47.480
graph, so we can plot it with BreezeViz.

11
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.310
The definition of the degree histogram
function is nearly identical

12
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.680
to the code from the previous
exercise that helped us create.

13
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.050
The histogram data array.

14
00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:06.623
Now we will calculate the probability
distribution of the vertex degrees over

15
00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:11.453
the whole graph by normalizing the vertex
degree by the total number of vertices so

16
00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:14.930
that the degree probabilities add up to 1.

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.070
The output of the first command is 28,
the number of countries in country.csv.

18
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.200
The output of the second command
is an array of numbered pairs.

19
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.190
The first number is the vertex degree,

20
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.180
and the second number is
the probability distribution.

21
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.590
Notice that the sum of all
the probability distributions equals one.

22
00:01:40.915 --> 00:01:44.950
Now we will plot two graphs to
visualize the degree histogram.

23
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.340
The first graph will be a line
graph of the degree histogram and

24
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.720
the second will be
the degree histogram itself.

25
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.540
We will not go over in detail how to use
the BreezeViz library to create graphs.

26
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.540
The project is well documented and there
are many resources online if you want to

27
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.070
explore the BreezeViz library on your own.

28
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.970
For the first graph we will define
the X axis as the vertex degree and

29
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.910
the Y axis as the degree probability.

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.520
For the second graph we will
just pass the metro graph

31
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.360
degree attribute to
BreezeViz's histogram function

32
00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:41.200
You should see two graphical
representations of the data.

33
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.260
The bottom one is the histogram.

34
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.880
The top shows the degrees
distribution plotting the histogram.

35
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.287
As we saw in the previous exercise's
array most countries have one metropolis.
