1
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:23,210
Genetic algorithms and we want to look at
GAs for solving TSP. So, as you know the

2
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:32,549
TSP of the travelling salesmen problem the
problem where you have to have

3
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,659
Hamiltonian cycle b in which you visit every
city exactly once and come back to the

4
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:44,609
original cities essentially and 1. So, for
example, if you have 9 cities you may have

5
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:54,539
representation which is that you start with
2. And you go to 4 and you go to 5 and you

6
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:10,780
go
to 6 and you go to 9 go to 3 1 7 and 8. So,

7
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,170
this could be 1 to a and since I am doing
JAS.

8
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,359
I may want to take 2 to us and try to see
how I can generate new to us after that? So

9
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:32,709
let
us I another to so let to say this is 3 7

10
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:43,849
some 2 to as have had mention this problem
earlier

11
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:53,368
that how do you now, device cross over operators
for the TSP problem? Because you

12
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:57,468
cannot do a single point or multi point cross
aver have for the simple reason that

13
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:05,629
supposing have what a do of cross over some
point then I 2 a would be 2 4 5 6 4. Now,

14
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:09,449
I
able to came back 4 which means I close the

15
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:13,459
loop earlier and so I come do a simple thing
like that.

16
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:22,640
.So they at 2 questions we want to look at.
One is that given this representation and

17
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:23,689
this
representation is called the path representation.

18
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:38,599
Because if all the told represented by
path and it is implicit that from the last

19
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,939
city in the path you come back the first city.
If

20
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:48,689
you means start with 2 4 5 6 9 3 1 7 8 and
come back to 2 if I rotated this by certain

21
00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:54,719
all
would see the same to. So, that the 2 question

22
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:04,840
we want to ask is what the representation
to choose and secondly what cross over function

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,860
to device all for that would the TSP is
problemise we said which your very interest

24
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,880
many people, because it is got estimated
many practical application as will. And people

25
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:23,359
would like to good get good solutions of
TSP problem what about the valuation function?

26
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,900
As a simple function in this case which
given a 2 you can the order commutates cost

27
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,670
an you can use valuation function keeping
in mind that it is a minimization problem

28
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:45,419
that you want to minimize total cost. So,
you

29
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,309
have to work out the problem will it is for
selection in a care full fraction which I

30
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,069
inversely proportional to the cost how is
it to solve the problem?

31
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,699
Because a very of a you can find representation
and it help use all the problem very

32
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:10,759
quickly essentially. So, let me try out a
small game with you. So, the game is that

33
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:13,699
that
say you and I playing this game and we have

34
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:23,089
to divided this 9 cities between us. And we
get to choose city by city so forget of the

35
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,000
cost to a cost nothing to do here this is
the

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,279
different game. And the game is the following
they give choose a city and I choose city

37
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:38,929
then you choose a city and I choose a city
and so on. The first person to pick up 3 cities

38
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:45,168
exactly which is adder to 15 men’s again
so nothing do with that your cost just a do

39
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:52,769
with
city labels in the labels are 1 to 9. So,

40
00:04:52,769 --> 00:05:06,378
how would you play this game? Let me say I
choose you choose something I choose 5 when

41
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:24,908
will be look at my representation so your
choose on what 8 I choose 5 you will choose

42
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:40,918
a 1 which will n1 that i to a chosen 8 and
7.

43
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:47,379
.I chosen 5 and 4 you on some of 3 city 15
not 2 cities.

44
00:05:47,379 --> 00:05:50,519
Any 3 cities you pick up any 3 cities.

45
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:59,209
.You cannot choose 7 I would suppose game
we cannot 7 will start again you

46
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:00,209
start 4.

47
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:08,269
I choose 6

48
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:27,058
.. I choose 2, I already chosen 6.

49
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:28,059
.

50
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:33,719
So you choose 4, I choose 6 any choose 5.

51
00:06:33,718 --> 00:06:36,389
.no 5 not 5

52
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:53,120
You set pick 8; you choose 8 then your forcing
will choose 3 anyway the point is not to

53
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,168
spend the whole class they in this game. But
discuss at that I do not know what can of

54
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:02,049
is
in your doing but, they can of is in I was

55
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:31,749
doing is shown by this figure. That I created
this you recognize this it is a magic who

56
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:38,119
some is 15 and what I was doing? I was playing
cross a cost I do not worth came you’re

57
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:45,189
playing something you a doing with. So, what
the point of the whole thing is the representation

58
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:51,249
of and helps solve the problem.
Especially if in some situation you have knowledge

59
00:07:51,249 --> 00:08:00,319
related to some mapping that you
can create with representation. So, will look

60
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,991
at representation here also, ideally we would
like to have a representation in which I can

61
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,008
do single point cross over for TSP. But this
is

62
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,028
not that 1 an there is 1 representation in
which we can do single point cross over, but

63
00:08:13,028 --> 00:08:16,189
will
come to that later. So, let us look at the

64
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:18,990
various cross over that people have tried
working

65
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:32,778
with TSP is a GAs and if you just look of
the were will find quite of your. Now, while

66
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:37,538
devising cross over 1 thing 1 should keeping
mind is at if should be nice if you can

67
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:44,350
.device cross over which would allow us to
carry forward good feature of 2 hours.

68
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:49,529
So for example, 2 hour have me features such
that some cities thing of cities which away

69
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:54,829
close each other are covered one by one in
that order. And that would be nice feature

70
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,040
if
in carried forward from 1 parent to a child

71
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:04,819
to be nice. So, let us look at some cross
over’s

72
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:24,830
so 1 cross over which is called partially
mapped crossover also call PMX workers

73
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:33,889
follows. That you choose 2 random points this
is p 1 and this is p 2 so a choose 2 random

74
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:53,429
points lets a this 1 and this 1. Let me choose
1 here then first you copy whatever is their

75
00:09:53,429 --> 00:10:01,780
between those 2 points so you have I would
not draw the segment know 6 9 3 1 here and

76
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:12,459
9 4 2 5. So, this is parent 1, parent 2 this
is child 1, child 2 your trying bill. So,

77
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,190
first part
some part of the solution in this copy in

78
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:16,700
to the child is respective child.

79
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,360
Now, remaining the part solution I really
would like to get something from the other

80
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:29,830
parents. So, in partially max map crosser
mapping between this city’s 6 and 9, 9 and

81
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,830
4, 3
and 2 and 1 and 5 can use this us following.

82
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:42,320
Now, remember this see 1 which is got part
of the 2 a from the first parent and you on

83
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
the next from the other parents. So, you try
to

84
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:54,959
copy the less so what are the less? Remaining
is 3 7 1 and 6 8 so you try to copy 3 here

85
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,259
in to this so this is c 1 in this c 2.

86
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:09,700
We find to c 1 can we want to get things for
this is p 1 and hence p 2. We are try to know

87
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:16,640
copy things in to c 1 from p 2 so we are try
to copy 3 with 3 we cannot copy, because 3

88
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:23,129
already exists in this. So, what this appropriate
that follow the point from there so from 3

89
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:30,100
go to 2 and copy 2 here so we get 2 here.
This is the class of this possible operators

90
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,360
if
you let you a repeat this you are try to copy

91
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
this 3 here, but you cannot copy 3, because
3

92
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,550
already exists in this child. So, you follow
this point a from here and take 2 so you copy

93
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:55,429
to 2 here then you want to copy 7 here from
here that is if you copy 7 here 1 you cannot

94
00:11:55,429 --> 00:12:05,179
copy so if follow the point at to 5 and you
get 5 here. Then 6 you cannot copy, because

95
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:10,609
6
is here the follow the point got to 9, 9 you

96
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,110
cannot copy, because 9 is here follow he point
at 4 an 4 can be copy it here. And that is

97
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:23,950
8 anyways with does not matter. So, this is
the

98
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:30,509
partially mapped cross over and I just illustrated
to this example and these the algorithms

99
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:38,220
for you to like. So, let me us repeat the
example this part of the 2 are is common to

100
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,529
the
parent. So, this c 1 gets this from p 1 an

101
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:44,990
c 2 gets this from p 2. The remaining part
of the

102
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:53,990
2 which is 2 7 5 4 8 it is got from this process.
The right to copy with 3 here, but I cannot

103
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,500
.copy 3, because 3 is already in might to
so a follow the point if from 3 2 this is

104
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,620
the
mapping that we a talking about partially

105
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,620
mapped process.

106
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,549
So, the mapping is between these set of cities
that you can instead of 3 you can place 2

107
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:13,740
so and this copy the actually both piece when
you do the others city you would do a

108
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,950
similar process. So, because I could not copy
3, because already there I go to 2 I am

109
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,560
allowed I can copy to 2 here than 7 I can
copy directly. Because the does not interfere

110
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:30,439
with anything 1 I cannot copy, because it
is here so I got to 5 and copy that. And then

111
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,870
4 6
I cannot copies of 6 I go to 9, but 9 already

112
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,009
here of 9 go to 4 9 get 4 here and 8 here.
So,

113
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:45,509
let us to the other 1 just complete the example.
So, I want to copy 2 here, but I cannot

114
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:53,669
copy 2 I go to 3 and I can am allow to copy
with 3 here than 4 I cannot copy here.

115
00:13:53,669 --> 00:14:02,919
Because its sales I go to 9 I cannot copy
9 so I go to 6 I can copy 6. Then 5 I cannot

116
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:12,829
copy, because 5 is here I copy 1 here from
the mapping then 7 I can copy directly and

117
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,980
8 I
can directly. As this process as a given only

118
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,120
these 2 children from this to parents. The
keep into many device is crossover operators

119
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,490
is see that the resultant things at you have
are valid to us the and the whole idea is

120
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:39,299
try in device cross over which are valid to
us.

121
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:51,859
Another popular cross over to be slinks is
the order cross over. And it works as follows

122
00:14:51,860 --> 00:15:05,029
that that like in this crossover you copy
first some things 6 9 3 1 9 4 2 5. And for

123
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,360
the
remaining part you take the slinks in the

124
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,100
order in which they appear in the other parent
so

125
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:25,500
what do I mean by that? That basically I want
all the cities to appear in my 2 out of this,

126
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,490
but I want to select them from the second
parent now.

127
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:38,919
But I got 6 9 3 1 from the first parent so
in my first parent I already have for this

128
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:53,559
9 6 3
and 1 this 4 I already got and what this already

129
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:03,719
crossover is that for the remaining cities
which I want which is 7 4 2 5 and 8 I simply

130
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,879
copy them in the other in which appear in
the other parents. So, for example, I can

131
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:19,399
simply an added this in 7 4 2 5 8 how do can
this? 7 is here 4 is here 2 is here 5 is here

132
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,149
8 is here. So, in the order in which occurred
in

133
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:28,990
the other parent I copy them in to this new
child. So, this child is got have the 2 are

134
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,629
from
its first parent and the remaining 2 are somehow

135
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:37,919
it is got from the other parent with I self
good crossover not you should think about

136
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:53,870
this an may be .. Let us
say another representation anything of another

137
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:59,100
representation for the traveling salesman
problem. I mean this is the simplest representation

138
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,090
the past representation it tells you

139
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,490
.from which city to go to with city an so
an this is that self representation.

140
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,490
.

141
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:26,549
So, there is one representation which is called
ordinal representation 

142
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:33,919
and another 1 which
is called adjacency representation. Let us

143
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:48,920
do the other 1 first and this works as follows
that I created representation for this to

144
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:57,900
find something 3 7 1 9 4 2 5 6 8 and it work
as

145
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:21,650
follows. That we haven index this is as index
in my representation and the value that is

146
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:25,269
a
told for each sell in the value that I would

147
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:29,240
go. So, you if i is a index which is one of
the

148
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,400
value. Then the value that I will tell is
the city that I will go to from higher cities.

149
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,930
So, if I
just look at this to this too is 3 7 1 9 4

150
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,779
2 5 6 8 from 1 I am going to 9. So, I have
9 here

151
00:18:50,779 --> 00:19:00,109
then from 2 I am going to 5 I have 5 here.
From 3 I am going to 7 here, from 4 I am

152
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:17,889
going to 2, from 5 I am going to 6. From 6
I am going to 8, from 7 I am going to 1, from

153
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:27,360
8 going to 3 which is the first 1 from 9 I
am going to 4. So, this representation is

154
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,969
called
as adjacency representation this a different

155
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:39,640
representation of a too are
So, you got if how we got this representation?

156
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,350
So this is the representation of
with this 2 only same as this to its us senses

157
00:19:45,349 --> 00:19:47,740
the representation is different. This choice
I

158
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,329
that I am going from 3 to 7 to 1 to 9 to 4
to 2 to 5 to 6 to 8.

159
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:57,500
This representation says that you tell me
any city and I tell you where to go from that

160
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,220
city. So, if you tell me city 3 where you
going from 3, so look at this index 3 you

161
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,220
say

162
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,750
.going to 7 where you going from 6 you going
from 6 to 8. So, if you see a 6 to 8, so

163
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:16,579
these a different is a called adjacency. Now,
every not every premonition is a legal

164
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:21,559
adjacency representation so let me given example.
Supposing I want to represent

165
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:34,639
something like this you go to 2 from 1 and
you go to 1 from 2 and so on. Now,

166
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:44,600
obviously, formation of number 1 to 9 I have
shown you formation the I do not care what

167
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:51,029
is the rest I am saying the this is not a
valid told. Because from 1 you going 2 according

168
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:56,710
to this is the index from 1 you going 2 from
2 you a going to 1 so already done know in

169
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:07,179
this cycle so it cannot to be part of a. So,
not so is my poser to you in the past

170
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:14,480
representation every formation in the value
to a in adjacency representation is not every

171
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:27,099
formation in the value to so is an in conscience
here I am losing out on some 2 hours

172
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:29,558
here.

173
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:43,690
So, if will member that in the past representation
if I what a located this representation

174
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:51,539
by cycle of any length. For example, I would
start with 4 2 5 6 8 3 7 1 9 then I would

175
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,289
get
same to our back which is the different formation,

176
00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:02,710
but the same 2 hours essentially where
is every 2 are has a unique representation

177
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,480
in the adjacency representation. Whereas,
to be

178
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,710
may in 9 city to a you a start from any other
9 cities and that would be still the same

179
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:25,380
to
.. Now, given the adjacency representation

180
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:37,090
so again of will it as this is
the index can you thing of a crossover. Given

181
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:47,049
2, 2 as adjacency representation can you
know exploit this fact that you know that

182
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:51,339
from this city 1 parent is going to 1. So,
let us

183
00:22:51,339 --> 00:23:05,808
to the other 1 in the other 1 you going from
1 to 7 from 2, 4 from 3 to 1 from 4 to 5 from

184
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:24,440
5 to 6 from 6 to 9 from 7 to 8 from 8 to 2
and from 9 to 3 S. I have this to 2 us in

185
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,900
the in
the first to this is p 1 and this p 2 the

186
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,120
different adjacency representation work and
of a

187
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,929
customer of at any think of.

188
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:44,808
Especially if you want to ensure that one
of the child is at least a better child better

189
00:23:44,808 --> 00:23:49,829
than
the parents look as a 1 once simple crossover

190
00:23:49,829 --> 00:24:08,460
operator it is called alternating crossover.
And we basically says that all alternating

191
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,250
cities you pick the parent from the you pick
the

192
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:37,558
next city from the different parent alternating
parents. So, choose from known parents so

193
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:43,609
that construct 1 2 so you choose let us say
the first so you a constructing lets a c 3

194
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:50,219
another child we choose the first 1 from p
1. So, this say you are going to 7 from 1,

195
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:56,490
we a
going to 7 then from 7 where are we going

196
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:02,700
to go 1 city says go to 1. And other city
says

197
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:18,259
go to 8 essentially from 7. So, here we cannot
choose 1, because if at know you can

198
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:24,069
.choose 1 in other problem we choose know
you cannot choose 1. If you go for 1 to 7

199
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:26,649
and
from 7 to 1 in you already in cycles so you

200
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,080
cannot choose 1. So, at this point you only
to

201
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:39,558
choose 1, but you are not to allow choose
1, because it is form a cycle you can either

202
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:51,230
choose other parent or you can make an random
choice so people if I both of something.

203
00:25:51,230 --> 00:26:08,190
So, the basic idea in alternating crossover
is to try and choose as you construct that

204
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,179
the
parent from alternate all the next city from

205
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:15,040
the alternating parent. And if you cannot
then

206
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,629
you to result to some 10 of random process
any things next so either you can u use 8

207
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,520
here
or you can choose random process. So, let

208
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:32,950
us say we choose 8 here and than we say for
the next 1 from 8 you go to 3 choose from

209
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,140
the other 1 you put 3 here. And then from
3

210
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,630
choose from the first parent you 1 go to 1
so you go to 7 you 1 go to 7 so you choose

211
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:52,010
something random. So, you can see that neither
of them can come here, because if you

212
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:59,379
go to choose 1 here then you saying form 1
go to 7, from 7 go to 8 from 8 go to 3 and

213
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:03,030
from 3 go to 1. So, that is so cycle that
you do not want to form and for the single

214
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,670
reason
you we any way you cannot go to 7 from 2 cities

215
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:14,420
so you can put 7 there so you would put
7 random value here. You can the exchange

216
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:21,240
this idea in say the alternating you can say
subtour crossover.

217
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:39,200
So, thus as be selected subtour to here in
both these example you can say choose a

218
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,890
subtour from 1 parent then choose a next subtour
from the next parent an then choose

219
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:50,350
remaining from the first and so on. Also,
in say of the alternating cities you can alternate

220
00:27:50,349 --> 00:28:00,099
subtour crossover you can exchange in this
idea. But the most in testing 1 here is called

221
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:22,439
Heuristic crossover, so let me write it here.
And what the heuristic crossover says is at

222
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:35,429
you first random a choose some city so let
us say you started city 6 or city 1 lets a

223
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:41,169
city 6
in another matter. Then for deciding as to

224
00:28:41,169 --> 00:28:50,831
way to go from that city you look at the 2
toward if your chosen 6. For example, as a

225
00:28:50,830 --> 00:29:00,178
starting point 1 parent says go to 8 the other
parent says go to 9 from 6 the heuristic crossover

226
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:10,210
says that take the short a of the 2 adjust
so 1 says go from 6 to 8 1 goes other says

227
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:20,259
go to 6 to 9. This one says the choose the
shorter of the 2 in this essentially. So,

228
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:23,950
depending on what the values are we will choose
the 8 or 9 in then construct the 2 of a from

229
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:28,730
8 other 9 in a similar. At every stage we
try to

230
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:35,940
choose where to go from that city based on
the distance to the next city and that is

231
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,650
easy
to do with this I, because you are now easing

232
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:45,090
in this fashion essentially. Try to do that
heuristic crossover with this and should be

233
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:49,058
quite difficult is an essentially. Because
this

234
00:29:49,058 --> 00:29:54,329
.as the index representation it tells you
exactly that if you 1 go from 6 from city

235
00:29:54,329 --> 00:29:59,049
5 what
are 2 parents in? Here you would at scan the

236
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:04,659
whole thing in say 5 from 5 go to 6 and then
5 from 5 go to 6 in this also.

237
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,660
.

238
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:23,210
So, the last one that you on look at is called
ordinal representation and it work as follows.

239
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:46,110
The let us take the first 2 an you just copy
here 2 4 5 6 9 3 in the ordinary representation

240
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:56,569
what you do? You just listen carefully to
this process you look at position, so think

241
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:00,990
of
this index this is 1 2 and so on as both.

242
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,940
So, this is the first city in a 2 a second
city is a

243
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,269
third city is a 4 city is and so on. You have
to a reference in this and is so less assume

244
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:13,049
as
the reference index simply this which is the

245
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:36,808
already in this cities name. So the first
city in

246
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:44,960
you 2 is 2 and that is second and the reference
index so you right 2 here. But your know

247
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:56,590
this from here reference here new reference
is the reference without the city 2 the next

248
00:31:56,589 --> 00:32:07,678
city in your 2 are is 4 and its reference
is 1 2 3 so you right 3 here and we remove

249
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:16,340
that
from there. The next city here 2 are 5 and

250
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:24,349
its indexes 3 here we right 3 here again and
remove this from here. And next cities 6 and

251
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:29,590
its indexes 1 2 3 its again 3 next cities
9 so

252
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:41,519
remove 6 from here 1 2 3 4 5, 5 here we remove
that the next 3 which is 2 here. And we

253
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:53,789
remove this and 1 which is 1 an then remove
1 then 7 which is 1 we remover 7 and 8 at

254
00:32:53,789 --> 00:33:00,819
this representation of the 2 are is calling
ordinary representation.

255
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:10,849
.So, just repeat what we are doing here is
that we have a reference index which is

256
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:17,639
dynamic which is only the index which have
the new cities the remaining cities.

257
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,830
Essentially we have all 1 to 9 so 2 is in
position to here so with 8 then we remove

258
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:27,730
to then
4 comes to position 3 then we remove 4 from

259
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:46,490
their 5 comes in position 3 remove 5 and
so on 1 we get this 2. As an exercise I will

260
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:54,169
ask to construct the to a ordinary
representation for the second 2 a as well

261
00:33:54,169 --> 00:34:01,330
all lets to it know so 3 is in position 3
when we

262
00:34:01,329 --> 00:34:08,389
remove 3 we get 7 which will be an position
6 and so on. So new I live it is an exercise

263
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:15,740
we to do. The interesting thing and this is
the exercise it I want to try would is at

264
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:20,469
1 to
represent 2 2 us using an ordinary representation

265
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:49,699
then you just to a single point
crossover. And you get 2 valued 2 us so why

266
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:55,549
do you like this single point crossover? We
like it simply, because it is very easy to

267
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:01,750
implement that is once you have a representation
the already do is cut of this thing at 1 place

268
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:07,429
and put together the cut race and new haven
1 new 2. But if you try to imaging words happing

269
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:14,819
here is at with is few different schemes
of representation they allow you different

270
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,039
says of crossover.

271
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,340
And for example, this adjacency representation
which is 1 of the most popular it allows it

272
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:28,579
you some form of heuristic knowledge we says
that from a given city you can makes

273
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:34,929
some in form choices to where to go next city.
So, even if you 1 not able to fill in the

274
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:39,159
parent from 1 of the 2 base on this whether
it is alternating crossover or subtour

275
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:44,589
crossover or heuristic crossover if you are
not able to filling from another parent. You

276
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:50,340
can say heuristically choose the closer city
which is the allowed and try to bill shorter

277
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,190
2
to us in the you are the ultimate go list

278
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,369
bill shorter to us where this presentation
does not

279
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:06,099
allow any such at all this presentation the
earn allow that. But it at is allows it do

280
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:09,309
a
simple crossover of essentially and remember

281
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:16,820
that is crossover as to be done in every
cycle for in every of parents at a choose

282
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
essentially.

283
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
..

284
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:36,359
So continue in our study of population based
methods. We look at nature again to get

285
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:44,170
inspiration from different way that the members
of the population interact with each

286
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:53,840
other. So, member, that we a said, that call
genetic algorithms some it action in genetic

287
00:36:53,840 --> 00:37:12,730
level which is the process of recombination
at genotype level. So, recombination happen

288
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:30,740
as a genotype level where as selection . happens
of the phenotype

289
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:46,239
level. So, the such is happening at a micro
level the mixing of gens from 2 different

290
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:52,959
parents to come off with new candidates. And
those candidates fainting without in some

291
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,610
real the women training to serve I have essentially.
Now, there is the another clause of

292
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:10,190
methods which some people call as cultural
algorithms, because they involve high level

293
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:16,940
interaction between the agency at what you
my say is a cultural level.

294
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,940
..

295
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:28,880
And there are various names by which these
algorithms go so 1 is all swarm intelligence

296
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:36,970
and it is in quite popular as optimization
method in the recent pass. Even choose a term

297
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:53,419
ant colony of optimization and we will look
at continue looking at the TSP problem for

298
00:38:53,420 --> 00:39:03,920
ant colony optimization. So, you must the
familiar with ant colony this ant colony was

299
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,088
a
terms which was use by . in one of this book

300
00:39:09,088 --> 00:39:13,070
. the
very shows that an individual ant cannot be

301
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,050
a very effective feature in some sense. But
I

302
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:25,670
colony of fans all society of fans is very
successful in that task what is the main task

303
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,409
at
ant such trying do? There the building nest

304
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:31,149
that were there is the we and sitting out
they

305
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:37,340
an there is worker and who job is so go out
to in the world for verge in food and get

306
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:48,849
some food bag essentially. Now, in terms of
that am interact with each other to a process

307
00:39:48,849 --> 00:40:02,340
of symbol essentially and this kind of interaction
called mimetic 

308
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:15,220
is that 2 symbols 2 signs
ant symbol essentially. And is very common

309
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:21,739
in the animal world for animals for feature
to use symbol for examples you know animal

310
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:30,019
used to mark territory essentially dogs
another predators used to mark territory.

311
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:39,849
But these ants are using it know kind of cooperative
fashion and they want to used. They

312
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:45,539
want to convey were they having being to the
less of the ant community and they do this

313
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:59,119
by a process of pheromone trails. So, pheromone
is a chemical sentences which an ant

314
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,030
drops wherever it goes essentially. So, you
can a imagine situation in the real world

315
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:08,460
.where the ants are answer exploring some
piece an dropping pheromone on the way back

316
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:12,590
essentially. Now, how to the use is pheromone?
Either drop was themselves always

317
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:17,769
somebody else is that have a tendency to go
in a direction which as pheromone trails

318
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:23,869
essentially. So, it is like marking out pass
for each other and following the pass

319
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:30,259
essentially. So you can imaging the situation
where there is an ant nest and that is if

320
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,640
4
hypothetical ants go of in 4 different direction

321
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:45,319
in such of a food. And let us say this is
founds some sugar here some 4 it is found

322
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,920
essentially 1 some food as the end of the
trail

323
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,659
essentially. So, let us a why in this happens
after some time some more ants come out

324
00:41:53,659 --> 00:41:58,449
and them what to the do? So initially 4 ant
spent out there after sometime 4 so let us

325
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:01,299
a 4
more just for the sake of the argument 4 more

326
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,070
ants come out then they likely to follow
the trails. Some goes this way some goes this

327
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,320
way some goes this way some go that.

328
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:13,570
Now, this ant which is found this piece of
food what was it do? Very unselfishly it brings

329
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,690
bag to the nest essentially so once it is
found this food it just follow its own trail

330
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:23,500
back
and goes back to the next and deposits a food.

331
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,530
But in the process if as tendency the trail
it

332
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,619
as deposited more pheromone on the way back.
So, this amount of pheromone on this

333
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:38,280
trail because more essentially. Now, if you
assume that that ant has a tendency to move

334
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,720
al1 pheromone trail in the more pheromone
there is in a kale the more the antive likely

335
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:45,449
to
following. So, the next ant which comes out

336
00:42:45,449 --> 00:42:47,960
is more like to choose this selection then
in

337
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,710
your base directions and follow that kale.
And notice that once more and more ants go

338
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,269
along with trail more and more pheromone will
be deposited along the way and the kale

339
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:04,389
becomes strong and stronger. And eventually
after period of time you will find that this

340
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:12,929
entered ant colony is sub tour travelling
food and back essentially.

341
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:19,639
Hence it is a common pheromone you must have
absorb in the real world essentially. Not

342
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,210
only that if you go to put an optical in the
pass of these ants if you own experiment then

343
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,289
off course we cannot follow the trail. So,
this part the cannot full so they will start

344
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:36,949
diverting in different direction. But eventually
some of them will come back to this trail

345
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:42,559
or some of them may find different pass of
the trail some make come back to the trail.

346
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:53,650
And in the thing is that the ant switch come
back to this trail will do it faster essentially.

347
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,760
So, they will is establish of pheromone trail
faster than an ant with goals of wonders of

348
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,420
in
count pack. And this fact that ants which

349
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:10,108
happen to do things faster they live the trails
earlier. And more ants follow on that trail

350
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:12,049
can be seen as process of optimization,

351
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:18,089
.because they are so the fine in the shorter
paths shortest paths of found first. Assuming

352
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:23,329
the they enough number of ants in this environment
shortest pass will be found first and

353
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:29,098
they will be followed first in so on about.
In that sense you will see that ants for you

354
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:38,849
open fine go to task to the 
to the source to the source of food an back

355
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,430
to the essentially.

356
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:41,429
.

357
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:50,608
Now, there was is group of miss chest that
by DORIGO at an who device is all go set up

358
00:44:50,608 --> 00:45:02,610
all will comes call an colony optimization.
And we look at it with an example of the TSP

359
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:19,490
problem. And the way that is algorithms works
is follows that let they we N cities and let

360
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:28,479
they we M ants. And we assume that is ants
kind of distributed randomly across these

361
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:54,500
cities. The basic process that we will follow
is at each ant constructs a tour in a greedy

362
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:06,909
fashion. Each ant constructs to a Grady fashion
and this will take N time steps because

363
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:20,549
the to a will have to have N cities. And each
ant also deposits pheromone we just use at

364
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:36,620
the pheromone again on the tour it constructs.
So, you can imagine that all these M ants

365
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:42,509
are there trying to find so all that travelling
salesmen problem try to fine the shortest

366
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:48,650
tour. Each an constructs a tour in a Grady
fashion and deposits certain want of

367
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:59,639
pheromone on the tour it is created. So, the
way will be look at tour is that we will look

368
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:06,230
at the amount of pheromone at the end of N
time units after each ants constructs a tour.

369
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:18,809
So, we will use T i j to stand for the pheromone
on the link from the higher city to this j

370
00:47:18,809 --> 00:47:19,809
i

371
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:27,779
.city. So, this is city i this is city j an
than off course there is the other thing essentially

372
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,269
so
how much pheromone is on this? You will do

373
00:47:31,269 --> 00:47:41,050
not by T i j and we will update it at every
N time units. So, if you know the tau pherom1

374
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:48,130
on time t you can compute the pheromone
at time T plus N after each. And this will

375
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:57,240
be updated as 
some of the whole pheromone

376
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:03,569
that was let from earlier times plus new pheromone
which has been deposited by ants in

377
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,769
the last 2. And the whole pheromone that will
deposit in earlier times as the tendency

378
00:48:08,769 --> 00:48:15,679
you operate. So, we will assume that some
of it will you operate so whatever the value

379
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:25,989
was at time T it we get you operate by some
value which is 1 minus let us a lambda

380
00:48:25,989 --> 00:48:37,649
where lambda we will calls as a coefficient
of you operation. So, lambda tells you how

381
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:45,760
fast the pheromone you operates. If lambda
is high if it is close to 1 then you can see

382
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,490
that
none of the whole will remain if lambda is

383
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:49,489
low.

384
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:51,889
Then you can see that some of 2 whole will
remain plus the new pheromone that is

385
00:48:51,889 --> 00:49:19,509
deposits and that we will call as tau i j
n let a say. We can say the incremental amount

386
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:30,109
is
delta tau i j at time t plus n let us say.

387
00:49:30,108 --> 00:49:33,569
So, this is the incremental amount of pherom1
that

388
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,700
and so deposited in the last cycle and this
is for tremens of the whole pherom1

389
00:49:37,699 --> 00:49:50,319
essentially an how much is this amount? This
is basically the sum fall i is equal to 1

390
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,070
to n
for each of the ants the amount of pheromone

391
00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:09,920
deposited while in the k let use k here were
using i n j here deposited by the k ant essentially.

392
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,260
So, the total pherom1 deposited in the
last cycle is the sum of the pheromone to

393
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,640
deposited by all the ants and for each ants
this

394
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:30,989
term delta tau i j k would be either 0 or
little be sum value it to be 0 if that and

395
00:50:30,989 --> 00:50:36,269
does not
have this i j h in h 2 an it to non zero if

396
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:38,909
it is it has i at in this 2.

397
00:50:38,909 --> 00:51:04,899
So that 2 cases a 0 if ant does not tours
edge i j otherwise it is a value it is denoted

398
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:09,660
by q
divided by l k were q is sum constant that

399
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:14,909
we use control this own computation. And l
k

400
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:29,779
is a cost of tour found by is ant kin the
k ant essentially. So, the important thing

401
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:32,980
here the
way the this dapples from the real world situation

402
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:40,639
is at the amount of tour amount of
pheromone that an deposits on an edge is inversely

403
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:48,500
proportional to length of the tour. It is
found which means that the ant switch fine

404
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,280
shorter to us will end of the deposits more
pheromone on those i j is and I am switch

405
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,130
a found long to us will at the deposited in
less

406
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:02,349
pheromone. So, again we want reinforce the
idea that an sit of fine shorter to us they

407
00:52:02,349 --> 00:52:05,050
will
encourage other and so follow that real essentially

408
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:09,510
and that why I will do deposit more
pheromone essentially. So, this is how pheromone

409
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:12,670
is updated at the end of every cycle

410
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,019
.now that lives is part of the Grady to a
construction how does and actually constructed

411
00:52:18,019 --> 00:52:23,039
to
is basically simple stochastic process in

412
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:29,389
which an ant and looks at a set of cities
at it can

413
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:39,069
move to and moves to it in a holistic fashion.

414
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:57,300
So, let us assume that ant at a city i 
moves to city j with a probability little

415
00:52:57,300 --> 00:53:01,560
bit like what
we did in the simulated . which is the proportional

416
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:16,009
to the following.
The amount of pheromone on that edge that

417
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:27,349
it is considering raise to sum power alpha
multiply it by a factor which is called eta

418
00:53:27,349 --> 00:53:33,200
i j is to power beta, so again alpha and beta
to

419
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:38,679
constant, if you control the influence of
these 2 factors. So, there 2 factors tau i

420
00:53:38,679 --> 00:53:43,099
j is a
want of pherom1 on that which an eta i j is

421
00:53:43,099 --> 00:54:03,239
called visibility. Basically it is inversely
proportion to cost of that edge. So, in other

422
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:08,229
words if that the adjust very if the if the
city j

423
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:12,769
is very close to city i and this eta factor
will shoot up. Because this is inversely

424
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:18,809
proportion to cost and then the ants so this
factors says that the ant is likely to choose

425
00:54:18,809 --> 00:54:21,440
a
city which is close to the city i at which

426
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
it is.

427
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:28,000
This factor says the ants likely to follow
that to good go to that city on which the

428
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:35,460
pheromone trails is higher. And then they
a control by these 2 parameters divided by

429
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:46,280
sum
of all a city that it can go to so T i h is

430
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:54,720
to alpha eta i h is to beta were h is the
set of

431
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:03,809
allowed city and what you mean by allowed
cities? Cities which will not close a loop

432
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:07,449
in
is remember the, that ask at we a try to find

433
00:55:07,449 --> 00:55:13,769
is complete tour the ants a so as at ask of
constructing a complete tour in a Grady fashion.

434
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:21,108
So, it goes of city to city and at any
point it only considers those cities as prospective

435
00:55:21,108 --> 00:55:29,828
destinations which will not close to
.. So, essentially what this ants it doing

436
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:36,730
is sitting at this location i and
it is got is we a assuming a completely connecting

437
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:41,829
graph here the it as we do in the TSP
so it can move to any other city.

438
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:50,460
But we will only choose those cities which
first of all it has not already tour, because

439
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:56,920
you
do not wonder close the loop again so it cannot

440
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,329
go to city which it has already tour
essentially. So, these only set of allowed

441
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:04,039
cities and from the allowed cities we chooses
is

442
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:12,289
to move to 1 of them call j probabilistically.
And the probability is proportion 2 thing;

443
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:19,599
one is how strong is pheromone trail on that
h. And secondly how close that new city is

444
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,710
to the current city, because eventually you
want to find shortest pass. In shortest pass

445
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,519
is
always be need of it adjust which are short

446
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:30,869
adjust essentially so this is the ant colony

447
00:56:30,869 --> 00:56:32,960
.optimization algorithm.

448
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:42,869
You have the set up ants each ant construct
a tour then base on the 2 it is constructed

449
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:50,019
each ant deposits a certain amount of pheromone
on every edge that it has moved on and

450
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:56,670
that the end of this whole process, we update
the amount of pheromone on every edge in

451
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:05,550
the graph. So, edges on which ants will travel
will have pheromone edges on which ants

452
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:10,810
will travel to fine short to us will have
more pheromone. And they will influence more

453
00:57:10,809 --> 00:57:16,449
ants to follow, because of this factor on
those adjust. So, in the end ideally like

454
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:18,989
in this
situation if all the ants of moving along

455
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:24,299
like 1 caravan. In the TS also 1 would expect
all

456
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:32,818
the ants would be travelling 1 optimal to
essentially. And it would be a go to exercise

457
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:35,590
for
you to influent this an colony optimization

458
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:41,930
and see how man, how the ants out up
converts to the shortest to at least for small

459
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:49,419
problems you can we seen quite easily. So,
will stop here and in the next class we will

460
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:54,950
move away from this optimization. And we
go back to state space such and try to see

461
00:57:54,949 --> 00:57:57,578
deterministic algorithms for fine in shortest
pass essentially.

462
00:57:57,579 --> 00:58:07,579
.
