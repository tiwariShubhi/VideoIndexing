1
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:27,859
Let us go back to nature today, and remember
we are doing optimization. So, does nature

2
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:29,509
to optimization?

3
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:35,280
.Yes sir, yes sir, n colony optimization.

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:45,670
Somebody said yes. Yes, but we are not going
to say n colony optimization, that is an

5
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,109
algorithm that if you, may not get time to
look at the today probably in the next class

6
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:55,269
essentially, what is it, what is optimization
happening there?

7
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,130
.Natural selection.

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,559
Natural selection, which is different from
n colony optimization.

9
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:14,478
N colonies are known to is very good at finding
food, if you leave a anything which

10
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:19,980
edible you know, a biscuit or lump of sugar
then, you can be sure that you know, within

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,700
some time ants would be there, somehow they
find it, you look at that in the next class

12
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,210
may be I think, we will go to natural selection.

13
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:36,259
So, you can think of, of course, many of us
considered human beings to be the pinnacle

14
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:44,109
of life forms. So, we can say, we have come
through a process of natural selection which

15
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:50,759
of course, is attributed, the theory is attributed
to Charles Darwin and you must have

16
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:59,239
heard about the well known phrase, survival
of the fittest, but what is nature doing

17
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:00,239
essentially.

18
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,520
So, let us set of step back and see what is
it trying to do? So, we can say it is trying

19
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,219
to
design live forms essentially. So, we have

20
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:18,370
whole wide spectrum diversity of life on earth
starting with cockroach, not starting with

21
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,341
a cockroach, starting with you know, some

22
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:32,560
.amoebas, and ants, and birds, and animals,
and so, we think that we are on top of it.

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:39,969
What would be the objective of this design
process, what is it trying to designed?

24
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:45,550
I mean if of course, we are trying to sting
by sting nature is like thing to design

25
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:52,939
something. Have you heard, how many of read
anything by Richard Dawkins? Which

26
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:56,930
one, which book have you read?

27
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,060
Student- The God delusion.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,959
The god delusion, that is one of his most
recent books I think, in which he says that

29
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,829
he is
kind of anti institution of religion, but

30
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:13,099
any way his one of the earlier books was called
the

31
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:20,358
blind watch maker, it was quite a well known
book, it quite a hit in that time. The

32
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:33,640
argument in the western society was whether
or not there was a god who created the

33
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:41,679
universe and the earth and human beings at
the center of earth.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,188
And the argument was that, you know that everything
is so perfect, the world is so

35
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:50,108
perfect, we just have the right amount of
oxygen in our air and we have everything that

36
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:56,209
we need, we have water flowing and we have
day and night and all this kind of stuff,

37
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,319
that
there must be a watch maker. If the universe

38
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,068
functions so perfectly like a Swiss watch
for

39
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:12,439
example, Switzerland is known for its mechanical
watches then, it could not have come

40
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:13,439
out of random.

41
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,529
So, this is an arguments against Darwin. Darwin
said that we came out of evolution. So,

42
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:24,969
people would aghast at the notion that we
have evolved from apes. Sometimes I think

43
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:34,479
that the apes might be more aghast at this
notion. The idea was that, such a perfectly

44
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,889
functioning world must have a maker behind
it of the watch maker, like a watch maker.

45
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:50,029
But Dawkins and Darwin, they are all on the
same side, they say that there is a built

46
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:56,168
in
ratchet mechanism. In a sense that if you

47
00:04:56,168 --> 00:05:02,370
find some improvement somehow then, that
improvement sticks around essentially. So,

48
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,930
there is a ratchet mechanism, if you by
mistake or by some chance event designed something

49
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,560
which works then, it has a
tendency to persist.

50
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
..

51
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:32,889
There is a person called Steven grand 
is somewhere in the UK, he wrote this book

52
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:40,418
call
creation, which the institute has one copy

53
00:05:40,418 --> 00:05:48,198
which is with me at this moment. If you want
to have a look at it, you can come and borrow

54
00:05:48,199 --> 00:06:01,889
it I think. You know I have heard about
creatures, these are computational . of people.

55
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:09,228
Life forms that you create in the so called
cyber world, artificial fish, artificial this

56
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:12,959
thing,
artificial that, in the creatures I means.

57
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,299
So, the term creature, if you just look up
creature

58
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,728
on the on the net, you will find some sites,
one of them is maintained by Steve Grand.

59
00:06:21,728 --> 00:06:30,269
So, he is the, in this book that he wrote,
he wrote something very profound at least

60
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:36,709
I
found it profound and it is that whatever

61
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:42,538
persists.

62
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:59,750
Just imagine a random world where there is
no watch maker, there is no creator, he says

63
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,139
that see this is at this is a kind of tautology
whatever persists, persists. Obviously, I

64
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:07,360
mean
that is what we say well, this is the fundamental

65
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:18,490
thing behind how life has emerged out
of chaos I might say essentially. I mean after

66
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:27,189
big bang I suppose there were chaos for the
lot of time and so, if you follow what Steve

67
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:33,110
grand is saying then the, you can say an
equivalent statement at the goal of life.

68
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:45,710
So, if life is you know some driving force
or something is to live, and by live essentially

69
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:56,269
.e mean persists essentially. But there is
no, one cannot describe some external high

70
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,758
level
goal to life, it just happens at we happen

71
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,479
to persists so, we are their essentially,
a goal of

72
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:14,909
life is simply to be there essentially. Now,
you can say that nature is experimenting,

73
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:21,590
I do
not really need to say.

74
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:29,119
Nature is, again when you say nature we do
not want to anthropomize again, nature is

75
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,479
not like god or some devata or somebody we
doing something. Nature is some term that

76
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:55,670
we use for everything that is around us. A
set of creating different designs for life

77
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:04,309
forms.
At least we can . like that nature is doing

78
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:14,190
it, see very often people
for the sake explanation describe a design

79
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:16,290
motive behind things which are happening.

80
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:22,599
So, why did we develop a neocortex? Because
you know, it helped us reason at a

81
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,889
symbolic level I think like that essentially,
but of course it is not, there is no motive

82
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:35,370
behind it. It just so happens that we walled
a cortex which allowed us to do thinking so,

83
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:43,399
we are thinking essentially. So, which is
what Steve grand says? Whatever persists

84
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:52,079
essentially. And this a basic mechanism behind
nature’s effort to design life forms, and

85
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,220
the goal of this life form is nothing but
to live, to persists essentially, and that

86
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,769
is our
. instinct to persists.

87
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,720
So, if you what walk out of this building
and you see somebody with a gun pointing at

88
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,649
you, the first thing you do is ., that is
our inbuilt nature to persists

89
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:18,909
essentially. And if you think of it in combination
with what is Steve grand say just

90
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:24,759
imagine that in the initial chaos there were
only atoms floating around then, molecules

91
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:29,870
form then, molecules combined into forming
bigger molecules.

92
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:34,669
And then, eventually organic molecules came
into being which has this tendency of

93
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:40,870
surviving and sticking together and then,
of course making copies of themselves and

94
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,220
so
on and so forth. Things which happened, happened

95
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,820
and those things which survive,
survive which is what Darwin called as survival

96
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,980
of the fittest essentially. Of the many
things that you are trying out, some things

97
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,710
survive and they are the fittest essentially.

98
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:03,980
So, when you say survival of the fittest,
one has to you know look at it from a careful

99
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:13,600
perspective, there it is not as if your first
determining fitness and then talking about

100
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,540
.survival. It is a other way around fact essentially.
When you say survival of the fittest,

101
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,469
what we really mean is that, the once who
survives are the fittest essentially.

102
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:38,070
Now, these life forms compete with each other.
What do they compete for? They

103
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,740
compete for whatever resources that they need
essentially, material resources, primarily

104
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:53,090
material resources like food and so, on. And
there is a limited amount of food and

105
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:58,360
remember that food is a building, food provide
just a matter for building our bodies

106
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,259
essentially. So, if a child grows up it is
by eating food and you know having that food

107
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:07,120
transform into various things inside his system.

108
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:20,539
So, they compete for resources which mean
that, some life forms succeeds and some life

109
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:27,789
forms fails essentially. Just imagine that
there is a bunch of people in a room, let

110
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:31,139
us say
there are 50 people in the room and there

111
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,710
are only let us say 20 cakes or something
like

112
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,090
that, and of course you cannot divide the
cake such you know.

113
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,410
Then, there is some mechanism by which people
are given cakes. So, some 20 people

114
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:46,350
will get cakes and 30 people will not get
a cakes and to be taking a next game point

115
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:52,460
of
you the is a very extreme you, but in some

116
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:59,810
time what is happening in the nature
especially that different life terms are like

117
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:01,469
different species.

118
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,470
.

119
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:08,600
.And nature is experimenting again I would
like to set of question that we say nature

120
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
is
experimenting it, nature is a not a like a

121
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,909
person setting of a there is a experiment
and

122
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:19,980
these things a happening on their own and
making view them as experiment essentially.

123
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:32,050
So, how is nature doing? It is nature is doing
generate and test. It is searching in,

124
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:37,729
remember that we started off by saying for
the basic paradigm of search algorithm that

125
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,570
we had look at this generate and test. Generate
a candidate and test, you know the

126
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,860
candidate, the solution that we had a smaller
problem, nature does not have a goal.

127
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,360
So, we do not have a goal test function, but
by testing we mean something else here. So,

128
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,629
what do you mean by generate? So, there was
a French poet, I do not know remember his

129
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:08,970
name unfortunately right now whose . he said
this process that a

130
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,000
world, this process of evaluation is that
one makes up the combination and the other

131
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
chooses.

132
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,179
So, there are two forces which are applying,
one is which is making up the combination,

133
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:45,009
which we will call as generate, and test is
basically other chooses. So, these are two

134
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:50,110
things essentially. What you mean by the other
chooses? Listen that there is a force with

135
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,389
natural selection which says that it will
select some people who will survive and will

136
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:56,509
not
people some creature will survive and some

137
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:57,509
which will survive essentially.

138
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:02,600
So, there were, there were selection happening
which is like a text function and there is

139
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,259
a
process of generating, creating new features

140
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:13,220
is happening. And so, just imagine this
world in which new creatures and by creatures

141
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,490
I mean individuals, I been created all this
time. And each of them is competing with other

142
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,860
creatures, they may be from the same
species or they may be from the different

143
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,860
species.

144
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,389
But everybody is competing for food essentially.
So, at the fundamental limit, I mean

145
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:33,990
that is so strongest basic urge is to eat
essentially, and that, where that we cannot

146
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:45,070
survive
essentially. How does these combinations come

147
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:54,350
out? Let us talk about other chooses
before we do that essentially. So, just imagine

148
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,659
that there is a rabbit o there is species
of

149
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:08,759
rabbit and there are these rabbits on field
and they are being chased by foxes essentially

150
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,110
also let us say on the same field. So, there
is a relation between them, the fox species

151
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,110
and

152
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:32,980
.the rabbit species. And I will use this as
a, which denotes the positive influence on

153
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,980
the
population essentially.

154
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,629
So, this is like some people call influence
diagrams. How does the population of rabbits

155
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:43,250
influence the population of foxes? We say
that there is a positive influence, beside

156
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,090
the
more the rabbits are there out there, the

157
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,180
more the foxes will get to eat them and therefore
the foxes will survive essentially. So, the

158
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:54,370
more, there is no famine nor

159
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,600
And of course there is a negative influence
of the population of the foxes and the rabbits

160
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:07,088
essentially. There of course there is this
whole eco system out there. So, when you have

161
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:24,088
foxes then, you have let us say tigers, when
you have tigers you have let us say bacteria.

162
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:31,329
And . familiar with this necessity you know.
The birds help

163
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:37,220
pollinate the flowers and there is the dependence,
the whole eco system there, it is a

164
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:47,089
stable eco system then, which every population
is having some influence on other

165
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:48,089
population essentially.

166
00:17:48,089 --> 00:17:52,038
So, now a day’s people one hears that is
suddenly bees vanish from this world, you

167
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:59,650
might have heard some news item. The bees
vanish when it will affect certain food chain

168
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:07,169
which means we stop getting things of a certain
kind. So, we have this stable eco

169
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:14,450
systems, but we also have catastrophic on
the way essentially.

170
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,808
So, like 60000 years ago or whatever when
the predominant life form was we ((Refer

171
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:25,569
Time.) so on. And mammals were you know small
smelly creatures hiding from

172
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,240
., but suddenly something happened and we
do not quite know what

173
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,620
happened. And . became extinct and mammals
become prominent

174
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:42,168
and then, human of course the most prominent
of those all essentially. So, we are talking

175
00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:45,470
about competition.

176
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,470
..

177
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:59,659
Thus competitor competition between species.
So, let us say we have rabbits and cows

178
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:04,480
and goats and sheep, all trying to go for
some ., I do not know

179
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,179
whether the rabbits eat grass, but at least
cows and goats and sheep all competing for

180
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,070
grass essentially so, there is a computation
between species. And there is also a

181
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:25,659
competition within the species. So, we are
going to focus on this, competition within

182
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,058
the
species. What do you mean by this? So, just

183
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:35,038
imagine again this bunch of rabbits on this
field and let us say 2 or 3 foxes come running

184
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:36,839
and the rabbits all run away.

185
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:42,648
Or more likely if you have watched some . it
is some set of bunch

186
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:48,000
of deer and one or two lions come running
then, all the Deers are running away. And

187
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,630
the
lion catches a in some sense of weakest one

188
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,000
essentially, the one which cannot run away
fastest so, the lion catches the weakest one

189
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,630
and the fastest deer they escape essentially.

190
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:07,720
To . leave to tell let us say another team.
So, there is competition

191
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:19,558
within the species. So, if there is a prey
and the age of species which is preyed upon,

192
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,950
there is competition within the species to
escape or to catch .

193
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:30,759
essentially. So, again the strongest lions
will be able to catch deer, by strongest we

194
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,329
mean
fastest so, whatever is the good quality,

195
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:37,990
the fastest rabbits will be able to escape.

196
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:46,240
.So, fastest is just a, just a actually that
I am using it, it is not necessarily fastest,

197
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,179
it could
be something else, cleverest or you know something

198
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,179
which can disguises itself very well
or any kind of things that nature adopts to.

199
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:59,840
So, there is a constant battle between the
predator and the prey essentially, both are

200
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:00,839
involving.

201
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:07,639
How are they involving? Because within, the
competition within the species is selecting

202
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:20,879
better and better individuals, which are propagating
there propagates in some fashion to

203
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:27,289
the next level essentially. So, that bring
us to one makes up the combination. So, what

204
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:34,678
is
the combination that nature has adopted? It

205
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:48,130
is of sexual reproduction 
and what is it lead

206
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:59,340
to it? Leads to genetic mixing, this is a
key. How does nature experiments with different

207
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:00,878
life form?

208
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:12,019
It mixes up genes of individuals. So, every
creatures is at least from this earth has

209
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:16,440
born of
two parents and inherits the genes from both

210
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,058
the parents. And there of course there is
this

211
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:21,099
whole theory of which are the dominant ones
and which are the recessive once and that

212
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:31,839
kind of stuff. But eventually there is a experimentation
with newer or newer

213
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:33,949
combinations of genes that life is doing.

214
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:45,650
So, we are, we up, we use the term genotype
for this. Nature is experimenting with the

215
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:51,548
genotype of, so, genotype is like the design
of a creature. So, of course you know

216
00:22:51,548 --> 00:22:57,259
amongst human being we say that this child
has inherited the height from one parent or

217
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:03,419
both parent or something like that essentially
or colour of hair or colour of eyes, all kinds

218
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,990
of things that you have inherited from parent.

219
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,798
So, you inherit some from one parent some
from another parent, and within a human

220
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:16,349
family one sibling may brighter than another
sibling and things like that because they

221
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:20,269
have inherited different things from different
parents and so on. So, we have this whole

222
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:25,278
churning of the genes which is happening then
with the genotype.

223
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:35,019
And at this other level which we call as a
phenotype, it is competition is happening.

224
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,099
It is
a physical creature which is competing on

225
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:53,778
the, in the real world essentially. So, what
is

226
00:23:53,778 --> 00:24:01,898
this we have to do with the optimization?
We want to look at a method of optimization

227
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:09,729
which is kind of takes inspiration from this
world of natural selection.

228
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:30,028
.So, this whole idea here is that of emergent
behavior 

229
00:24:30,028 --> 00:24:37,859
and the idea of emergent behavior
is that you put together simple parts to give

230
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:46,278
you a more complex things essentially. So,
nature is, it is this building blocks of life,

231
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:50,038
which are called the genes that we have, which
is trying out with different combination of

232
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,319
genes and letting them loose in the world.
And if they survive, they survive.

233
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,730
So, they are competing for food they are competing
for mates, they are competing for

234
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:11,649
shelter, the once who manage to win they will
pass on their genes to the next generation

235
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:19,658
and in the process we will have in some sense
fitter population. So, the population of

236
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:26,840
rabbits becomes faster, again I am using faster
just as we are talking about it. As they

237
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,079
evolve they become faster, at the same time
foxes are becoming faster. So, there is a

238
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:36,990
sort
of war going on between them essentially.

239
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:50,710
So, emergent behavior 

240
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:58,360
is this approach to
optimization, it says let us try to do this

241
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,658
so called random mixing of genes.

242
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:07,778
So, again this is a randomize process, and
see if we can somehow keep track of the best

243
00:26:07,778 --> 00:26:16,990
one. So, what is the basic idea? You allow
for random mixing of genes 

244
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:24,099
and you have a
mechanism for keeping the best. So, this thing,

245
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:28,000
one makes up the combination and the
other chooses. So, there is this two processes,

246
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,690
one is combining things which generates
and test, one is combining things to produce

247
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:37,149
a new creatures and there is some
mechanism which is judging. So, which creatures

248
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:41,408
are good and which creatures are bad
and allowing them to survive essentially.

249
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:47,289
And in the process, we want to see if we can
improve upon the designs and come up with

250
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:50,750
the optimal design, whatever optimal means
here.

251
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:51,750
..

252
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:03,490
So, this idea of optimization is called by
the known name of genetic algorithms, also

253
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:23,778
called GAS for example. And they were devised
around 1980 or so by John Holland, and

254
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:38,690
one of his students call David Goldberg 
is still very active in this area. And in

255
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:43,230
fact, he
has written a book which is called genetic

256
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,940
algorithms or something like that, which is
a

257
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:55,528
very popular book on this topic essentially.
So, the idea of the genetic algorithms is

258
00:27:55,528 --> 00:28:04,710
that
they work with populations.

259
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:28,750
So, the first thing of course is you have
to first appears to encode. You are working

260
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:38,398
in the
solutions space so, you have to encode a solution

261
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:45,738
as a string so, I just used a term string.
But if I were to be from this community, instead

262
00:28:45,739 --> 00:28:56,278
of string I would say chromosome. So,
it is a chromosome which start of contains

263
00:28:56,278 --> 00:29:01,888
the design decisions that you are going to
work with, but will tend to think of it as

264
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:04,519
a string essentially. So, the first thing
is to

265
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:11,769
encode the solution as a string. So, the simplest
example that we can think of is the sat

266
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:18,489
problem where the solution is just a bits
string essentially or TSP can be encoded as

267
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,489
some sort of string.

268
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:23,100
And for any kind of a problem that you want
to solve with GAS, you have to encode it as

269
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:38,019
a string essentially. So, this population
is a population of strings essentially. So,

270
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:46,819
this
population p 1, p n let us say we have n population

271
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:52,489
of n elements inside it essentially.

272
00:29:52,489 --> 00:30:06,558
.Then, the next thing you want to do so, the
first thing is to encode.

273
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:09,990
Candidate solutions are string essentially
so, essentially what are we trying to do that

274
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:12,079
we
will work with the population of initial randomly

275
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:17,548
generated candidates. And then, try to
mix up the strings to produce new candidate

276
00:30:17,548 --> 00:30:21,138
which will hopefully be better essentially.
And how do we decide better?

277
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:26,199
So, we do not let loose this things in to
the designs in to the real world as nature

278
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:33,190
does.
We devise something call a fitness function,

279
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:48,399
it s a f of n which is the same as what we
call eval of n which was the same as what

280
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,428
we call of a h of n start with.

281
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:55,538
Remember that we came to this world of optimization
by starting with a heuristic

282
00:30:55,538 --> 00:31:00,450
function and that we said the evaluation,
we call it the evaluation because that is

283
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,450
what the
optimization community calls it. And in particular

284
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:09,288
the genetic algorithms can be calls it a
fitness function essentially. So, with every

285
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:15,489
candidate we have a fitness value, which tells
us how good that candidate is essentially.

286
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:34,399
I have to see how much time we will have.
So,

287
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:39,829
there are, there are 3 basics steps to a genetic
algorithms so, we start with a initial

288
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:40,829
population P.

289
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:41,829
.

290
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:53,250
.And then, the first step is the so, this
is the preliminary what we are doing designing

291
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,618
the
system, but the algorithms itself, the GA

292
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:59,709
algorithms has 3 steps, the first step is
called

293
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:19,350
selection which is proportional to fitness.
So, unlike the real world, genetic algorithm

294
00:32:19,349 --> 00:32:25,319
does cloning essentially so, just creates
copies of candidates.

295
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:47,668
So, what we do? We have these candidates p
1, p 2, p 3, p n and for that each of them

296
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:55,130
we
have a fitness function, and we reproduce

297
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,289
this population, clone this population by
clone

298
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:08,759
individuals in this population, in proportion
to their fitness which means we will make

299
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:16,690
more copies of fit candidates and less copies
of unfit candidates, less meaning 0

300
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,350
essentially or more could be 1, 2, 3, 4, anything.

301
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:31,699
How do we do this? We create, it is a similar
process to how do we create this whole

302
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,788
random process. We can think of it as a . in
which we assign sectors

303
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:53,528
proportional to their fitness in is p 1, is
p 2, is p 3, is p 4 and so on. The amount

304
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:58,278
of angle
they get is proportional to the fitness value

305
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:02,429
so, p 4 is very fit so it gets a large angle,
p 3

306
00:34:02,429 --> 00:34:07,070
is and so on and so forth. And we just sort
of rotate it randomly and we have a some

307
00:34:07,069 --> 00:34:15,299
pointer, where ever it stops that candidate
gets to reproduce once.

308
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,480
So, we rotate it let us say P 4 it stops at
P 4. So, remember that this is something which

309
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,789
can rotate and we give it a random rotation
like . and observe where

310
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:38,880
the needle is. We do this n times and generate
n new, a population of n new elements.

311
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:49,070
So, let us call it P 1 prime, P 2 prime, P
n prime. So, this is the first step, selection.

312
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:54,061
We
are just making copies of the original, but

313
00:34:54,061 --> 00:35:00,430
which the difference that everyone does not
get to make a copy.

314
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:07,679
Fit members have a greater chance of making
more copies that you can see there is very

315
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,139
lightly that P 4 will stop at, the P 4 will
be created, will stop at this, at this arrow

316
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,650
more
than once essentially. So, P 4 may get more

317
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:20,289
copies, this thing whatever it is here will
probably get 0 copies or something like that.

318
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:26,389
But of course it depends upon chance, the
randomized algorithm, we cannot say deterministically

319
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:30,940
what will come about it. All we
are saying is that these rule wheel we will

320
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,470
spin n times and whichever names of the
candidates appear against the needled we will

321
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,569
create a copy of that.

322
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:42,190
.So, we will create a new population of n
candidates and you can see that this population,

323
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,720
the fit members will have a greater chance
of appearing more than once, and unfit

324
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:58,769
members may get the wheeled out essentially.
So, it is a little bit difference of what

325
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:05,710
happens in nature, we do not create the final
thing, final individuals and out, and send

326
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,780
them out to compete.

327
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,070
We allow them to clone in proportion to how
good they are essentially and they can get

328
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,039
to clone more than once. After that is the
second step is called in .

329
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:31,829
of the j a community, it is called cross over.
And what we do here? We randomly pair

330
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:32,829
this population.

331
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:39,599
So, for example, we may pair P 1 with some
other one, P 2 with somebody else and so

332
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:47,469
on and so forth. We randomly pair of these
elements of this new population and we

333
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:53,949
randomly mix up their genes, that mix up of
genes is called cross over and that is just

334
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:56,619
a
term that we use. So, the idea is something

335
00:36:56,619 --> 00:37:08,159
like this for example, let us say P 1 is a
made

336
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:26,170
up of let us say gene which we call x. Let
us say that there are 9 components to this.

337
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:32,119
So, for example, if it is a sat problems with
9 variables then, there will be 9 bits

338
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,289
essentially. So, we are just calling them
x 1 to x 9 then, P 2 so, let us say p 1 is

339
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:41,989
been
paired with p 2, or you can call it P i and

340
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:48,599
P j. Since, I am using, that is a P i and
P j and

341
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:56,389
let us call this y 1, y 2, y 3 up to y 9.

342
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:01,750
So, where these 2 parents so, p 1 and p i
and p j are the two parents which have been

343
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:07,510
mated together by this random process of mating.
We just randomly made two elements

344
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:14,020
and then, we wanted to the mix up their genes.
So, one way of doing it to just draw line

345
00:38:14,019 --> 00:38:32,150
somewhere and generate new children. So, c
1 is equal to we take x 1, x 2, x 3, x 4,

346
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:38,000
from
here and then, y 1, y 5, y 6, y 9, from this

347
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,159
essentially. The other child get the other
genes

348
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:50,629
so, this will get y 1 to y 4 and x 5 to x
9.

349
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:55,250
This process of mixing of genes is called
cross over, and you can see why it is called

350
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,760
cross over is that you know some genes are
crossing over from one candidate to the other

351
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:10,730
and vice versa policy. This particular cross
over is called single point cross over, but

352
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:16,639
you
can devise other cross overs, I mean there

353
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:18,319
is no, nothing . about this

354
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,300
.single point of a, just to illustrate we
have done that.

355
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:27,390
So, we will randomly choose a point here and
everything on one side will go to one child

356
00:39:27,389 --> 00:39:30,659
and the other side will go to the other child
and likewise for the other distinguish. So,

357
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,420
we
can imagine a sat problem in which you get

358
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,430
first 4 bit value from one candidate, one
solution and the, and the next 5 bits from

359
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,879
the other parent essentially, in likewise
for the

360
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,910
other child essentially.

361
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:49,279
So, you can see this 2 components of it talked
about, one makes up the combination is

362
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,750
being done by the cross over part, and this
the other chooses is being done by the

363
00:39:53,750 --> 00:40:09,630
selection part essentially. And we basically
put this in to a loop essentially. You take

364
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,090
a
population generate a new . population, do

365
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:19,730
cross over and go all
over again.

366
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:31,750
Now, for the sake of completeness that sometimes
a population may be lacking a gene

367
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:46,400
essentially. So, how do, new kind of species
emerge out of this process essentially? We

368
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:55,010
have a third step so, the first step is selection,
the second step is cross over, and the third

369
00:40:55,010 --> 00:41:07,650
step is called mutation. And by mutation we
mean random and not only random it is a

370
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:17,619
rare event. Every once in a while you change
one gene randomly in one individual so, we

371
00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:23,389
had this whole population of n elements here
which is reproduced according to fitness

372
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:31,469
then, we do cross over to make sub genes.
And then, we make some random change in

373
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:32,679
one candidate.

374
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:42,859
So, this is a just to allow for new genes
to come in or if a so, for example, if you

375
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,950
have a
population of this sat problem let us say

376
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:49,819
these 9 variables sat problem and you have
a

377
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,350
population of 50 candidates and it so happens
that all 50 of them have their 3 rd bit as

378
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,539
0
essentially. Now, we can see that if all 50

379
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:07,759
of them as a 3 rd bit as 0 then, however much
we do this churning the 3 rd bit will remain

380
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,660
0. Because both parents are going to have
the

381
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:16,460
3 rd bit as 0 and this cross over operation
will result in the 3 rd bit means 0 in both

382
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
the
children essentially.

383
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:22,079
So, you have lost that 3 rd bit in some sense.
To create it to something like that, we have

384
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,170
a random change somewhere in mutation, but
we do it very rarely essentially. These are

385
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:33,099
.just for the sake of completeness. So, the
primary processes is selection and cross over,

386
00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,230
but there is a process which once in a while
we do which we make some change in some

387
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:39,659
candidates essentially or random change in
some candidate.

388
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:48,269
So, when we talk about sat we are talking
about bits, but otherwise we have to do this

389
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:53,179
encoding in to the production in a low careful
fashion. And then, we have to because you

390
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:57,769
know one bit is nice, but most, for most problems
you cannot have a components

391
00:42:57,769 --> 00:43:02,309
represented by 1 bit, you will have a chunk
of bits. Then you have to devise a algorithm

392
00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:07,210
to move around chunk of bits rather than you
know just single bits and then, you have to

393
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:10,460
be careful about mutation that you can change
mutate something in to something

394
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:16,920
meaningful and not something which is not
meaningful ..

395
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,920
.

396
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:28,860
So, from this we get a new population let
us call this P 1 prime prime, P 2 prime prime,

397
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:35,610
P
n prime prime. So, the first P prime population

398
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:41,360
we got by cloning and this P prime prime
population we got by cross over essentially

399
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,970
and let us say mutation has been taken into0
account here essentially.

400
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:53,480
Now, there are variations to what people do
at this stage, if I assume that these are

401
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,710
sorted
on fitness values then these are the best

402
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:00,630
on the, just for the sake of processing, these
are

403
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:06,910
.sorted, the most fit numbers are here and
the least fit numbers are here. So, what one

404
00:44:06,909 --> 00:44:16,019
might do is that, one might take the most
fit k elements where k is a little bit smaller

405
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:25,269
than
n and we place it in the original population

406
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:30,969
by the least fit k elements.

407
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:37,639
So, what are we doing here is that we started
with this population of n elements, and let

408
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:41,900
us assume that they are sorted according to
the fitness here just for sake of allowing

409
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:48,800
me
to draw this diagram. We clone the entire

410
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,600
population to get a new population and when
I

411
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:59,710
say entire population, it means that you get
representation in proportion to a fitness

412
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:00,710
value.

413
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:06,119
A very fit member will get more copies, and
a very unfit member will get less copies or

414
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,170
0
copies, some will have to have 0 copies then,

415
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:15,480
you do this cross over, mix up the genes,
took arrived at this population which is now

416
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,090
mix up the genes of the old ones. Now,
some people would argue that what if there

417
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,269
was a very good candidate here. This P 1,
let

418
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:29,929
us say its fitness value is 98 or something
like that, and everything else let us say

419
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:32,980
began
with 67 and 65 and so and so forth. Are not

420
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,530
you losing your candidate with fitness value
98 essentially?

421
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:45,640
To, create it to this, one way to devise this,
is that you take the most fit to most fit

422
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:52,349
candidate in this new population and add them
or substitute this least k fit population

423
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:57,909
with this worst k fit population. Then, keep
those few top from the original population

424
00:45:57,909 --> 00:46:00,879
here, we just design question.

425
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,240
You can say k equal to n and that is what
really happens in nature essentially. I mean

426
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:18,759
nature does not allow one to live in definitely
essentially. If you want read some of these

427
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:27,240
work by Goldberg in fact this book by Goldberg
then, he goes on to study as to how

428
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:37,519
should we design these encoding scheme so,
that good genes in some science have a

429
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,030
tendency to stick together and carry forward
essentially.

430
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:53,290
So, let us say if we have this some or let
us say this sat example with 9 genes or 9

431
00:46:53,289 --> 00:47:01,099
variables. And let us say some good values
we have found in some candidate where let

432
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:06,599
us say x 3 and x 4, we have found what should
be the value in the ultimate solution. How

433
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:13,489
do we kind of make sure that, they stick around
together essentially. So, Goldberg talks

434
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:22,059
.about things like cluster of jeans and so
on which will so, he calls, he has a some

435
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:25,630
notion
of saying that if you have gains which sort

436
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,820
of a design kept together then, they will
stay

437
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,350
together. They are more likely to be not split,
broken up essentially.

438
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:36,519
Essentially one of the things with this genetic
programming or genetic algorithm

439
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:43,039
community is concern with is that is there
some way we can ensure that when a

440
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:50,099
candidate has good genes, we can ensure their
good genes stay together essentially. And

441
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:57,869
they do not get broken up and divided in because
in this case as we can see, it is a very

442
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:02,589
clear cut exchange of genes essentially.

443
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:09,900
Every genes of parent for example, if x 3
is a good gene, it will go to exactly one

444
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,980
child in
this way, in this scheme of thing because

445
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:20,329
c 1 will get x 3, but c 2 will get y 3 essentially.
So, it is not as if, as it, as it happens

446
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,610
in the real world, their good gene can go
to both the

447
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,079
children, in this case it will go to only
one child.

448
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:33,489
So, if x 3 and x 5 for example, happen to
be good genes, how can we sort of ensure,

449
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:37,080
how
can we ensure that you know good genes stay

450
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:41,130
together? It means they stay in one
candidate only essentially. So, this is a

451
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:43,470
kind of stuff that Goldberg has looked at,
you will

452
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:54,879
not go in to those details here, but you can
see that this scheme of things where we select

453
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,440
the k best and replace the k worst with this
k best is in some sense trying to keep the

454
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,210
good candidates still alive essentially.

455
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:13,449
Of course this even prime prime which is a
totally new candidate because it is got

456
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:20,429
generated by the cross over. It could be P
1 cross over with some other elements is

457
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:24,169
totally different then, it could in fact be
better than 98 it is quite possible essentially.

458
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:30,460
That
is a hope that as we mix up genes, the candidate

459
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,329
with the good genes will propagate their
genes more often and we are showing this by

460
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:38,469
the process of selection which is
proportional to fitness essentially.

461
00:49:38,469 --> 00:49:49,669
So, I think I will stop close to here, if
there any question you can answer them. In

462
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,809
the
next class when we meet, I will take up an

463
00:49:52,809 --> 00:49:59,070
example again from Goldberg’s book to try
and give you ((Refer Time :49:55)) behind

464
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:02,130
genetic algorithms. But I also wanted you
to

465
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:06,869
think about our, not our, the community’s
favorite problems which is the travelling

466
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:07,869
sales

467
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:15,960
.man problem. How can we use genetic algorithms
for solving the travelling salesmen

468
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:23,159
problems? So, either way outside let me say
that because the way that we have encoded

469
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:30,629
TSP so far is that let us say we have 9 cities.

470
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,630
.

471
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:50,710
So, let us say parent 1 is 1, 2, 3, 7, 1,
and parent 2 is let us say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

472
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:55,139
6, 7, 8, 9. I
have these two parents which means I have

473
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:57,569
these two towards. So, here you go from 2
to

474
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:04,240
3, 3 to 7, and 7 to 1, and 7 and so on. Here
you go for 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 and so on so

475
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,199
forth.
You can see that the single point cross over

476
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:09,489
will not work here because if I just take
a

477
00:51:09,489 --> 00:51:15,589
random point let us say here after 4 cities
then, what I am doing? I am going from 2 to

478
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,150
3
to 7 to 1 to 5 to 6 to 7, you can see I have

479
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,039
closed the loop even before, I am not allowed
to that.

480
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,820
In a travelling sales men problem, the solution
must be a permutation of the cities, but if

481
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:33,769
I do, if I do this single point crossover
and say this is, I will take this cities from

482
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:36,539
here and
this cities from here. What I get is not really

483
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:40,119
a candidate tour because this tour has a loop
inside before.

484
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:46,460
So, again from 2 to 3, 3 to 7, 7 to 1 then,
you are going to 5 to and then to 6 and then,

485
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:52,039
you are coming back to 7. And you are never
visiting some cities, you never visiting 4,

486
00:51:52,039 --> 00:51:56,480
.you never visiting 8, you never visiting
9. So, that is not a candidate solution. What

487
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,490
we
want is a population of candidate solution,

488
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:05,029
and what is a candidate solution? In which
every city is visited exactly once and then,

489
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:06,530
which means basically it is a permutation
of

490
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:13,110
the number 1 to 9 and this sequence of numbers
that is not a permutation because 7 is

491
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:22,640
repeated and 4 is missing essentially so,
it is not a permutation. How can we devise

492
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,739
cross
over operators for the TSP essentially.

493
00:52:24,739 --> 00:52:29,729
So, this has, this question is in two parts.
Can we think of a different representation

494
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:33,179
of
that candidate solution, and can we think

495
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:36,509
of different operators essentially, different
cross operators? And there is been a considerable

496
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:41,470
amount of work done in trying to
experiment with different kinds of cross over

497
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:42,469
operators.

498
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:46,829
So, we generalize the notion of cross over
to say that you take two parents, and you

499
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:50,000
must
somehow get two children which are generated

500
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,480
from those two parents essentially. So,
these two things we will do in the next class

501
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,590
to start with. Look at the example of genetic
algorithms for a simple problem and then,

502
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,769
we will look at how TSP can be solved using
j

503
00:53:02,769 --> 00:53:08,590
s and I wanted to give some thought to at
before come to the next class because we will

504
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,590
stop here.

505
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:19,590
.
