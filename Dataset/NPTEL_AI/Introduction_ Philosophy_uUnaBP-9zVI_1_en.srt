1
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:23,329
So, let us get back to this question on the
philosophical side of our introduction, so

2
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:26,809
what
are mines essentially.

3
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:34,409
So, if you remember the view from Aristotle,
it said that our

4
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:38,669
thoughts are our reflection of what is out
there.

5
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,170
If I see an apple or if I think of an apple,
it

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,489
is because there is an apple out there and
my thought is in the image of that apple that

7
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:52,229
is out
there.

8
00:00:52,229 --> 00:01:01,119
The diametrically opposite view was given
to us by Canter much much later; he said

9
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:07,750
that what is out there is the reflection of
our thoughts that what we think is out there

10
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,890
is what
we think is out there.

11
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,200
Now you see there is a gap that you can never
cross, because what you think is out there

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,960
is
only what you are thinking is out there, what

13
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,149
is really out there.

14
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,060
So, you see a person you
know person sitting here.

15
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,420
So, I think there is a person sitting here
especially.

16
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,000
So, I have this
concept of people; I have concepts of you

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,459
know boys, girls, men, women, all kind of
concepts, trees, chairs.

18
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,548
So, that is how I think about the world and
it is out there.

19
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:40,439
So, I also
have concepts about clouds and you see an

20
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:43,358
image of something in the clouds; you see
a

21
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:47,178
dog in the clouds or you know something else.

22
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,179
.

23
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:54,019
.What is out there really is a question we
want to start with and then we want to we

24
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,069
have
seen already that the notion of the mind has

25
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,728
come about the people understood that there
is

26
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:06,269
something called the mind; gradually over
a period of time when they realize that what

27
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:11,849
they are thinking about is not in direct correspondence
with what is out there.

28
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,049
But now
what we want to discuss is that it is a necessity

29
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:25,680
that if you have to have an intelligent agent,
we have to have a mind which can represent

30
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,319
the world in a way that it can manage the
representation effectively.

31
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,189
So, that is the question I am driving at today.

32
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:37,759
So, let us start with the basic question as
that

33
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:40,459
what is reality; of course, we live in a world.

34
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,239
We are also part of this world, but what is
the

35
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,239
objective reality?

36
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,590
If you wanted to create a model of the world,
how would I do it?

37
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,069
No what
is really out there, any suggestions?

38
00:02:56,068 --> 00:03:00,378
We are talking about reality.

39
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:12,079
So, you are saying that
reality is as we see a collection of situations

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,340
which we can manipulate.

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,650
No, but simpler
things like people take this young man sitting

42
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:27,920
over here; is he real or what is the young
man; what is the human being?

43
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,919
.

44
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:39,318
Okay, now let us take a scientific enforce
point of view, the physics point of view;

45
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,589
everything in the physical world is made up
of a small number of fundamental particles.

46
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,569
So, whereas a small number of fundamental
particles I mean there is a number of different

47
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:54,109
particles are small; it is not that the number
of particles is small.

48
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:56,659
The different type is small
actually.

49
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:59,769
So, depending on what theory you are following.

50
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,450
So, the simplest one could

51
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,609
.follow the bore atom module, for example;
you know an atom is made up of protons and

52
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,760
neutrons and electrons and everything else
in the world is made of these three kind of

53
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,848
things essentially.

54
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:20,189
So, physics is, of course, I have been struggling
to figure out what the world is made up of

55
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,769
but let us take it for granted at it is some
fundamental particle; it could be something

56
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:39,399
smaller that proton and neutron, but everything
is there, and these particles they obey some

57
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,758
laws of physics.

58
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:51,430
So, the laws of physics are sufficient to
explain what is happening in the

59
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,430
world out there.

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,470
So, that is a first assumption that we will
work with and it is not something

61
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,940
that we can dispute because then you are saying
the physics is wrong essentially.

62
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:05,670
So, like
Penrose was saying that the physics of the

63
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,550
brain we do not understand, then you would
be

64
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:11,240
saying that we do not understand the physics
of this world essentially.

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,360
So, the physics is believe that that you know
we do not know what the.

66
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,150
So, there is a sling
theory, then they are neutrinos and gluons

67
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,060
and that kind of stuff, but there is something
out

68
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,060
there.

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,699
And they all behave according to the laws
of physics which we are trying to

70
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,710
discover; by the way they behave according
to these laws, and, therefore, everything

71
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:34,640
can
be exchanged according to these laws.

72
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:36,910
So, that is enough to understand the world
in some

73
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,180
sense.

74
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:50,530
So, we are talking about people, what is the
person.

75
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:56,909
So, even adult, it is made up of
about 10 raise to 27 atoms.

76
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,050
I do not know whether you can visualize the
number 10 raise to

77
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,919
27, but you should try; it is a huge number.

78
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:12,539
So, we can think of a person or person not
in the social sense, but in the physical sense;

79
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,660
a
human body is made up of about 10 raise to

80
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,660
27 atoms.

81
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,340
So, this young man sitting over there
is just a collection of a 10 rise to 27 atoms

82
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,709
which for some reason decide to stick together,
and the reason is given by the laws of physics.

83
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:31,579
It can be explained by the laws of physics,
and of course, we may call it in different

84
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:32,579
terms.

85
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:38,219
We may talk about biology or chemistry
and so on, but deep down they obey these laws

86
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,410
of physical is fundamental particles obeyed
essentially.

87
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,670
So, we have mention earlier that there are
two views of the world.

88
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,479
One is
materialist view which says that there is

89
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,538
only matter and the other is the idealism
view

90
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,430
which says that there is no matter essentially.

91
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,819
So, which is why in the last line I had said
that if there are fundamental particles; you

92
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,848
know
some people believe that it is all energy

93
00:07:03,848 --> 00:07:07,050
or something out there essentially, but that
let us

94
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,629
not get into that kind of a thing.

95
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,629
So, we are trying to understand the world;
we are trying to

96
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,889
.model the world; we are trying to why do
you want to do that?

97
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:18,819
Because an intelligent agent
and we discussed this in the early lectures

98
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,759
should be able to operate in a meaningful
manner in the world.

99
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,629
Do something useful for itself and achieve
its goals and you know

100
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,040
learn and that kind of stuff.

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,099
So, it needs to represent the world out there,
but what is the

102
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:33,209
world out there is the question we are asking.

103
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:34,209
.

104
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:39,549
So, human beings is about 10 raise to 27 atoms,
and these 10 raise to 27 atoms are

105
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,288
continuously interacting with zillions of
other atoms out there; you know we breathe,

106
00:07:45,288 --> 00:07:48,839
we
eat, we have sound wave impinging upon us

107
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:56,418
which are also made up of oscillating particles
and so on and so forth essentially.

108
00:07:56,418 --> 00:08:01,250
So, if we try to talk about reality in these
terms like a

109
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,980
physicist, can we ever make sense of this
world out there?

110
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,349
And when I say it makes sense
of this world as I mean in the practical sense

111
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:15,550
as an intelligent agent in some environment
trying to do useful things especially.

112
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,680
So, can we ever hope to write down the equations
for them and solve them even if we

113
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,509
know the equations and what would we get if
we solve them especially.

114
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:29,240
The trajectories of
their location how does that help us?

115
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,350
You know that atom number 259 is moving in
this

116
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,470
direction or something, does not help.

117
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,940
So, if you want to interact with the world,
we need

118
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,060
to have our own level of presentation, and
this is what I am going to be driving at today.

119
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:55,289
The world that we interact with like handset,
it is a world in our minds especially.

120
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:56,289
..

121
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:03,049
So, we have already said that the world around
us and including us operates according to

122
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,659
and can in principle be explained by the fundamental
laws of physics; nothing else is really

123
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:15,409
needed, but it is too big for us to work with,
because the number of amount of information

124
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,069
we would have to use would be too much essentially.

125
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:24,590
What we do is that we create our own
worlds in our minds, and it is only our creation

126
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,590
that is meaningful to us essentially.

127
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,500
So,
coming back to the example of a person, I

128
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,350
do not think of a person as an example of
10

129
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,950
raise to 27 atoms behaving in some concerted
action.

130
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:42,660
I think of it as a single entity a person
who is sitting on a single entity called a

131
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:47,480
chair or
eating a single entity which is I call a dosa

132
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,750
some masala dosa; for example, I think of
it as

133
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,750
one thing essentially.

134
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,639
Of course, it is not one thing; it is made
up of so many things and so

135
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,720
many processes and I do not want to get into
that at all.

136
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,790
So, we create levels of abstraction
at which we represent things and reason at

137
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:03,969
those levels of abstractions.

138
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,129
So, we should also
keep in mind Newell and Simon physical symbol

139
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:14,820
system hypothesis is that we can create
symbol systems and manipulate that symbol;

140
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,600
that is enough for us to reason about the
world in an intelligent fashion essentially.

141
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:27,920
So, Douglas Osheroff who I will talk about
again in a moment has a different notion of

142
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,009
a
symbol which we will not peruse very much

143
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,009
here.

144
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:34,960
He talks about how the mind creates
symbol, how the brain creates these same symbols

145
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,960
that we are talking about.

146
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,250
We stand for
a person and so on and so forth.

147
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,730
So, when I was talking about a symbol, I said
something

148
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,899
.which was perceptible.

149
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,709
So, for example, I write the name of a person;
I can read it

150
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,650
essentially or I can you know type it in a
word processor and things like that, but Osheroff

151
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,980
also talks about symbol processing in the
human brain that the human brain leads symbols

152
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,230
and what are the symbols?

153
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:02,500
These are kind of concerted patterns of activity
in thousands of

154
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
neurons.

155
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,629
So, we will not go into more detail than that,
but somehow neurons act in concert with each

156
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:18,200
other in a manner which we are inspecting
ourselves, think of a symbols that we are

157
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,759
reasoning with symbols.

158
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:28,870
So, this kind of an idea has been exploited
in movies; of course,

159
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,279
movies do not necessarily depict reality.

160
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,919
So, again coming back to the matrix, so if
those of

161
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:48,169
you have seen matrix would remember that its
main character called Neil Neo; in Neo’s

162
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:55,879
mind, Neo was a software engineer working
in New York city, and that is how the movie

163
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:04,139
begins, but in reality, whatever, that means,
neo is in some cell in some human battery

164
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:09,919
which the machines have constructed to extract
the energy out of him.

165
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,939
So, which is the complicated sequence which
we have to sought off watch the movie

166
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,370
carefully to understand that when eventually
that something is pulled out of his brain,

167
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,419
he
really finds himself in some very unknown

168
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,019
like place you know inside some cell where
he

169
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,059
is just unit of a large battery or something
like that.

170
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:41,889
The important thing that I am trying to
say is that it uses this idea that the world

171
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:46,580
we live in is actually in our minds out there
essentially which is why, of course, sometimes

172
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,770
people can hallucinate.

173
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:52,370
They imagine
something what is not out there, because their

174
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,329
minds are sought of not in sync with again
let me use the word reality out there.

175
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:02,940
But there is a big case in that you know we
do not know what is reality; we only know

176
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:06,730
what
we know essentially.

177
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,740
Inception is another film in which you would
not know whether you

178
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,830
are dreaming or whether you are in some real
world.

179
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:18,680
And this is not the physical system
hypothesis says that if you can create a level

180
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:21,250
of representation and is it not that level
that

181
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,259
should be enough for creating intelligence
systems.

182
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:24,259
..

183
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,149
We have dense slides that I have put in; we
are not going to go through this slide.

184
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:37,259
It is just
to illustrate the levels of scale at which

185
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:39,580
our concepts exist.

186
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,200
Remember that in the end
everything is made up of examples of this

187
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,800
fundamental particles, but then we talk of
people, we will talk of football field, we

188
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,779
talk of a planet.

189
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:52,289
All these are at different levels of
scale.

190
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,319
There is a very nice movie; I do not know
how many of you have seen it called,

191
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,360
‘powers of ten’ which is available on
the web, and there is a link I have given

192
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,519
here which
essentially is rooms out of a level in which

193
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,960
a couple is seen in a park and goes to the
very

194
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:19,580
top most level here which you can see a 10
rise to 26 meters and then zooms down back

195
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:28,200
and goes to the bottom most level which is
10 raise to minus 17 meters and things like

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
that.

197
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,210
So, at different levels you see the world
with a different perspective.

198
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,800
Suggest some
examples, for example, mustard seed is about

199
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:46,399
one millimeter thick whereas the distance
from Chennai to Pune is about 1100 kilometers.

200
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:55,669
So, in these powers of ten, you keep
magnifying the image all reducing the image

201
00:14:55,669 --> 00:15:00,750
by powers of ten every time and then you sort
of keep diving in deeper and so on and so

202
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,200
forth.

203
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,830
So, you can see at the top most level, there
are very things that we cannot I mean our

204
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,830
mind bowels to talk about something like ten
billion light years.

205
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,560
First of all, you have to imagine what is
a light year or remember what is a light year.

206
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,059
It is
a distance covered by light in one year and

207
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,609
we do not even think of light having speed.

208
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,389
I
mean I just see you and you raise your hand

209
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,759
and I see instantaneously; where is the

210
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,759
.question of speed?

211
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,509
We do not even have a notion of speed; of
course nowadays we have

212
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:42,759
thanks to Einstein and all these people but
light travels at a finite speed.

213
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:45,431
And we do not
realize it because we know it is so fast for

214
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:47,629
all of us here that everything happens
instantaneously.

215
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:53,870
We do not suffer from these effects of relativity
and things like that.

216
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:58,090
But ten billion light
years, how much would the light travel in

217
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,090
ten billion years?

218
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:02,220
I mean we cannot even think
of these kinds of things especially, alright,

219
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,940
the very extreme end 10 raise to minus 17
meters where you have quacks and gluons and

220
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,430
so on and so forth.

221
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:17,419
So, the world as we think
of nowadays exists at these very different

222
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,339
scales of things; that are at one level.

223
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,970
At another
level, it is all just collections of fundamental

224
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,340
particles which we have already agreed that
we cannot deal with at that level; that is

225
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,670
why we think of these different scales especially,
okay.

226
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:30,669
.

227
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:36,000
So, our perceptible universe is a small subset
of the scales essentially.

228
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,820
So, the largest thing
we can see is may be about a kilometer across.

229
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,060
So, like the golden gate bridge and San
Fransisco or something like that, and the

230
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:48,349
smallest thing is may be a mustard seed or
may be

231
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,580
some people can see pollen you know there
is rays of light and you can see dust particles.

232
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,820
Some of them may be 0.1 millimeter across.

233
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,050
So, you can perhaps think about things at
this

234
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:00,399
level of scale essentially.

235
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,019
So, the human mind as far I am trying to get
at; the human mind

236
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:11,019
has evolved to create concepts at these scales
essentially.

237
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,930
.So, we tend to think of objects at these
scales; that is why we are comfortable with

238
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,930
this.

239
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,320
We
are not even comfortable talking about how

240
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,480
far the planet Jupiter is from here, because
we

241
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,440
cannot even imagine that kind of a thing.

242
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,610
And at least we have not evolved to imagine
that

243
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:34,439
kind of a thing, and to reasons at different
levels, we have created this different discipline.

244
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,690
So, we become a specialist in biology or geography
or aestrophysics or anything.

245
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,690
.

246
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,299
But each discipline operates in its own level
of scale; social science is operated some

247
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:46,799
level
where we are talking about collections of

248
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,809
human beings.

249
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,329
Remember human being, each
human being is collection of 10 raise to 27

250
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:52,329
particles.

251
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:56,839
So, social science in some sense is
talking about collections of 10 raise to 27

252
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,689
particles, but we do not, obviously, think
in

253
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,490
terms of fundamental particles any longer,
and we have these different disciplines

254
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,808
especially.

255
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:05,808
..

256
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:15,190
So, Hofstadter, so remember this mind-body
problem which Decant was blipping with that

257
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,750
if there is this world of the mind which is
reasoning about the real physical world out

258
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,539
there
the body; how do the two things interact essentially?

259
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:32,450
Nor the physics we say we have laws
of physics of the fundamental particle level,

260
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:37,660
and if you know that, you will know how the
rest of the system is having essentially.

261
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,910
But Hofstadter says that we have to introduce
a

262
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,240
notion of what he calls as downward causality
which means the causality is from a higher

263
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,430
level to a lower level.

264
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:56,549
Even though the laws of physics can explain
going from particle level to ensemble particle

265
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:00,029
level, he says that is not useful for us,
we have to think about how.

266
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,430
So, for example, if I
want to drink a cup of tea, then I am thinking

267
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,480
at a level about cup of tea and so on and
so

268
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
forth.

269
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,599
And this level of thinking which is happening
with its concepts at this level of

270
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:23,059
abstraction is eventually driving at one level;
you might say my muscles or my nerve cells

271
00:19:23,059 --> 00:19:29,240
or something at even lower level you might
say the very fundamental particles which make

272
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,170
up my hand, for example; in such a manner
that my hand eventually reaches out for that

273
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,570
cup of tea and pick it up and you know take
a sip from it essentially.

274
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:46,359
So, the causality is from our level of reasoning
to the lower level where things are actually

275
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,359
happening.

276
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,279
Now physics, of course, does not have a notion
of causality; that is why

277
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:57,720
Canter’s even when he was talking about
human categories, he was saying that is face

278
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,130
and
causality are given to us that we accept we

279
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,480
have to start working with those things

280
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,349
.essentially.

281
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:09,349
.

282
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:15,019
So, these things are calling epiphenomenon.

283
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,950
So, things like pressure, for example, in
a

284
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:26,480
balloon, we talk of pressure, but what is
really happening that lower level activities

285
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,180
you
know molecules of different kinds of molecules

286
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,360
in air, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide,
everything; they are moving around randomly

287
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,869
and you know impinging upon the inner
surface of the balloon.

288
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,859
And this cumulative activity or the epiphenomenon
phenomenal of

289
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:43,899
pressure is dealt essentially.

290
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,280
Likewise, in our human brains, there are these
billions of

291
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,220
neurons which are firing away in some fashion.

292
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,890
We do not tend to think of our brain in that
fashion.

293
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,100
I tend to think of my brain and say, oh,
I want to have this cup of tea which is operating

294
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:04,859
at a very higher level essentially.

295
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,399
So, can
a machine operate at epiphenomenon level like

296
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,310
this, and that we feel is necessary for
machines to be intelligent.

297
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,579
So, we have run through this.

298
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:22,240
So, computers are manmade
objects; we know how they operate.

299
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,539
So, it is easy for us to explain; for example,
if you type

300
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:31,139
something in a word processor, in principle
somebody can say that at the lowest level,

301
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,620
these are the kind of micro level operations
which were taking place.

302
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:39,349
But we do not do
that, of course; we as human beings tend to

303
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:42,159
think of machines as doing higher level things.

304
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,920
So, how do we see a machine computer?

305
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,940
As a music player or a web browser or a game
or

306
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,000
any of these many things that a machine can
do; so the important thing is that many people

307
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,140
have called starting with tuning is there
is a universal machine.

308
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,800
The computer just like us is

309
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:01,960
.a universal machine.

310
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,270
So, if you want to call yourself as a universal
machine and the

311
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,399
universal machine is a machine which not only,
of course, a simple machine can do only

312
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,410
what it is designed to do, but a universal
machine can imitate other machines and do

313
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:17,670
what
they were doing.

314
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,410
So, they are flexible in that nature.

315
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:27,070
Scans as a machine be intelligent; Hofstadter,
so I come

316
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,829
back to Hofstadter.

317
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:37,139
He says that if this machine can introspect
and examine its own

318
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:44,300
behavior, then it is possible for it to become
intelligent essentially.

319
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:49,919
So, he is going one
more step from Newell and Simon.

320
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,310
Simon and Newell they said that if you can
create

321
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:57,200
symbolic representations and create algorithm,
you still work on this representation; that

322
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,009
is
sufficient and necessary to create intelligent

323
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:03,009
behavior.

324
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:07,000
Now we can see that that is at one
level of.

325
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,349
So, there have been layers and layers that
one has to talk about.

326
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:17,779
In computers, we have bit
level representation; they have machine code,

327
00:23:17,779 --> 00:23:20,690
assembly language, higher level languages,
higher level data structures, representations,

328
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:29,509
objects, all kinds of things and you keep
going higher, likewise in the real world out

329
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:30,519
there.

330
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,779
So, Newell and Simon said that one level
of representation which he calls as the symbol

331
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:40,460
level is enough, but now Hofstadter is going
one step further.

332
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,329
He is saying that in addition to that, you
need this capability to introspect

333
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:47,329
essentially.

334
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:50,559
So, if you read his book, it is quite an interesting
book to read; I must change

335
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:51,559
the loop.

336
00:23:51,559 --> 00:24:01,558
He sought of goes through a long detailed
argument of how Godel discovered this idea

337
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:06,559
of
self reference in Rusell and Whitehead Principia

338
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:14,369
Mathematica, and this in spite of the fact
that Rusell and Whitehead went out to formalize

339
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:19,159
everything, and they wanted to keep
away self referential structure.

340
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,480
So, they had layered logical representation
or typed logical

341
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,079
representation where self reference would
not be possible.

342
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:33,569
The same type of an argument
element could not be an argument to a sentence

343
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:41,429
in that same language essentially, but
Godel constructed this very elaborate; he

344
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:45,799
gave us very elaborate mechanism of how to
construct a sentence.

345
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:49,149
So, there is this two levels at which things
are operating upon.

346
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,580
One is this level of number
theory which is principle of mathematics is

347
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:59,289
all about, but there is also this level of
encoding things into this number theory and

348
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:04,519
then encoding sentences like I am lying or
something like that essentially or this sentence

349
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,359
is not true and things like that.

350
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,409
So,

351
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:20,650
.Hofstadter is saying that if a machine can
have this capacity to introspect and reason

352
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,100
about
its own actions which means also reason about

353
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,459
other people’s actions, then it can in
principle be intelligent.

354
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:35,910
So, let us talk about intelligence agents
for a moment; it is a very popular term nowadays.

355
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,058
So, these are programs; we will talk of intelligence
recent programs which are persistent

356
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:45,160
which means like the operating systems, for
example; if we leave a machine on that is

357
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,540
exist
all the times essentially.

358
00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:49,279
They are autonomous which means that nobody
is saying that run

359
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,869
this program, run this routine or call this
subroutine or something like that; they are

360
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:54,869
proactive.

361
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:58,509
If the see an opportunity in the environment,
they sense an environment; they

362
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:00,400
will go after it essentially.

363
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,220
And they are goal directed which means that
you know they have goals; of course, these

364
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,789
goals may not be self generated; they could
be given by the creator essentially.

365
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:09,409
It is just
like we have that secret agents and the governments

366
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,900
are supposed to have who have all
these properties they are persistent, autonomous

367
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:19,530
and proactive, but they carry out the
billing of the government essentially.

368
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:20,529
.

369
00:26:20,529 --> 00:26:25,980
This is a rough diagram of what an intelligent
agent should be like.

370
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,240
So, that white figure at
it is supposed to be the agent, and the thing

371
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,920
inside that is what is in the head of the
agent.

372
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,269
And what is in the head of the agent is the
module of the world out there, and the module

373
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,660
of
the world should contain itself which means

374
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,190
it can introspect on itself.

375
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,730
And, obviously, you

376
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:54,880
.might ask the question as to it that if the
model of the agent has a world in which the

377
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,559
agent
is there, then in that agents head also I

378
00:26:57,558 --> 00:26:59,039
should create the model of the world.

379
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,808
So, there is an
infinite level of next thing which is possible

380
00:27:01,808 --> 00:27:02,808
in principle.

381
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:09,878
So, they are these kinds of very
curious loops which can form, okay.

382
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,878
.

383
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:15,289
So, we are slowly coming towards moving away
from history and coming to what we want

384
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:16,710
to do.

385
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,520
If you want to build an intelligent agent
which interacts with the real world, then

386
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,210
you
have to have at least these layers of different

387
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,090
kinds of reasoning.

388
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:27,959
One is the outermost layer
is what we can call a signal processing.

389
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,058
It means you are receiving signals, sound
waves,

390
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:38,940
light waves or whatever from the world, and
the innermost layer is symbolic reasoning

391
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,779
which is what is classically AI is what all
about that you can create symbol systems and

392
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,399
reason with them.

393
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:51,300
And you may have and this is my interpretation
of this whole thing that an intermediate

394
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:57,950
layer of neuro-fuzzy systems which serve the
purpose of converting signals into symbols

395
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,950
essentially.

396
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:05,170
So, for example, if I am speaking and what
I am creating is a signal which is

397
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:14,600
you know sound waves of a particular pattern,
but your brain is converting these sound

398
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:16,990
waves into linguistic entities essentially.

399
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:20,960
So, you are recognizing words out of this
sound

400
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,279
wave; from these signals you are extracting
symbols essentially.

401
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:29,690
So, if I say the word apple, it may be certain
sound wave which is meaningless in itself

402
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,100
just
like neural activity in our head is meaningless

403
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:36,469
in itself, but you can process it to understand

404
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:45,220
.at a higher level to stand for a symbol apple,
and neural networks are particularly good

405
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,539
at
doing this kind of things.

406
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:51,009
So, you must have heard about fact that character
recognition if I

407
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:57,109
were to draw the letter a on a hand written
characters.

408
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:58,109
.

409
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:05,099
So, if I write A like this, if I write A like
this, if I write A like this; we have no difficulty

410
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:09,469
in
recognizing that these are A and neural network

411
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,220
is also very good at this sort of a thing.

412
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:16,269
But
at some point, you may start getting a doubt

413
00:29:16,269 --> 00:29:18,009
about whether I am writing an A or whether
I

414
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:26,579
am writing an H. And it is very difficult
to describe rules to say that this sequence

415
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:29,470
of
segment forms A, this sequence of segments

416
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,900
forms H and so on.

417
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,259
Whether the learning
system which will learn these characters in

418
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:40,640
context of other letters around them will
eventually learn to recognize the character

419
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,580
A for example,
So, neural networks are very good at this

420
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:46,839
sort of a thing, but if you want to do give
an

421
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,250
explanation of let us say the Pythagoras theorem,
what is the Pythagoras theorem and how

422
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,380
do we prove it.

423
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,940
Then neural networks are not really very good
at that kind of a thing; for

424
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:01,120
that we need this symbol manipulation ability
which everybody is from Simon Hostettler

425
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,289
is saying it is necessary for intelligent
behaviors essentially.

426
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:06,289
..

427
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:12,839
So, these are the topics that one can identify
if you look at AI in general.

428
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:14,919
This is not the
topics of this course.

429
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,880
If you look at the enterprise of AI, then
we have all kinds of topics

430
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,111
here, knowledge representations, semantics,
anthology, models, search, memory, machine

431
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:31,309
running, problem solving, planning, adversarial
reasoning, qualitative reasoning, natural

432
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:33,819
language understanding and all kinds of topics.

433
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:42,808
So, on the left what I have drawn in this
figure are the sensing kind of activities.

434
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:49,210
Signal to symbol kind of activities, speech
processing, image processing, video processing,

435
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,529
computer vision, neural networks, pattern
recognition, studs sensors and that kind of

436
00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:55,529
thing.

437
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:57,829
On the right hand side, it is the opposite
from symbol to signal.

438
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:00,149
So, you have motor control
of.

439
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,630
If you want to build robots, you have to eventually
make the robot do what the robot is

440
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,120
thinking about doing.

441
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,929
If the robot is thinking about going from
place A to place B, it must

442
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:13,440
do something to make their physical movement
possible.

443
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,870
So, we need activators and things
like that at that time essentially.

444
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:18,859
So, these are the topics of AI.

445
00:31:18,859 --> 00:31:23,649
In the circle, basically this
figure is taken from my book the circle roughly

446
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,070
it is a kind of describe what is there in
the

447
00:31:27,069 --> 00:31:29,548
book.

448
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:37,869
So, of course, we are doing this course on
AI which we are doing here, but in our

449
00:31:37,869 --> 00:31:41,769
department, there are a whole lot of courses
which cover these areas.

450
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:46,720
And I just want to
give you some idea of the kind of courses

451
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,819
that we offer.

452
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:52,629
The first four courses that will
come are courses which I am personally involved

453
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,270
with, but the rest of the courses you

454
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:56,299
.know mostly my colleagues are handling.

455
00:31:56,299 --> 00:31:57,299
.

456
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:05,240
We will start with this course which is Ai
which kind of covers some of this stuff inside

457
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,170
this thing here, then planning and constraint
satisfaction.

458
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,279
These are names of courses.

459
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:12,129
So,
this will be offered next semester; for example,

460
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,010
both these courses will be offered next
semester knowledge representation reasoning

461
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,119
as well.

462
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,039
Then there are other courses which
my colleagues teach machine learning which

463
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,109
is being offered now.

464
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:30,619
Pattern recognition is
also being offered now I think.

465
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:35,639
Natural language processing as well is being
offered at this

466
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,700
moment.

467
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,069
Probabilistic reasoning is not being offered
at this moment; very often I think Dr.

468
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:46,450
Ravindran offers it as a self study course.

469
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,920
Then we have computer vision; I am not quite
sure which semester, may be this semester

470
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,350
it is being offered.

471
00:32:53,349 --> 00:33:00,149
Speech technology, Kernel
methods, this is I think next semester, visual

472
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,820
video processing, computer graphics.

473
00:33:02,819 --> 00:33:05,509
We do
not have so much on the output side.

474
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:07,730
So, you can see our department is not very
strong in

475
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,730
things like robotics.

476
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:12,660
So, we do not really offer courses in that.

477
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,009
Imagine mechanical
department may be offering some courses.

478
00:33:15,009 --> 00:33:20,039
So, in terms of assignment, I might have
mentioned this earlier; one assignment is

479
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,230
going to be on game playing.

480
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:25,710
So, I will try to do game playing not in this
order but a little bit earlier than this order;

481
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:27,710
may
be after heuristic search or something like

482
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,710
that.

483
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,759
So, that you can get going, and we will
decide which game and we have to implement

484
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,190
an algorithm for it.

485
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:35,190
And your programs will

486
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:37,549
.play against each other that kind of stuff.

487
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:42,769
And another assignment would be
implementation of some of these algorithms.

488
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:43,769
.

489
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:46,579
So, we will sort of assign some algorithm
and you should implement in that way; we will

490
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:52,769
go into the details as we go along course,
okay.

491
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:53,769
.

492
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:57,298
The text books as I said it is a text book
which I have just written and everything that

493
00:33:57,298 --> 00:33:59,779
I am
teaching is from there and vice versa in the

494
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,500
sense what is there is what I teach.

495
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,569
So, we will
use that as a text book, and then there is

496
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:07,609
a host of others reference books that I will
point to

497
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:08,659
.as and when needed essentially.

498
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,450
So, already from these reference books, we
have in some

499
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:17,469
sense finished with two of them which is Pamela
McCorduck machines who think and

500
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:21,519
John Haugeland AI the very idea artificial
intelligence is the very idea, but some of

501
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,751
the
other books we will refer to as and when the

502
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,519
time comes essentially.

503
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:38,559
So, we will stop here and next on Friday when
we meet, we will have quality type shift and

504
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:59,940
start devising algorithms for simple search
that just we mentioned essentially.

505
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:09,940
.
