1
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:20,300
Let us get back to our local search. And the
key words, that you must keep in your mind

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,919
is Optimization.
.

3
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:33,039
Remember, that we converted the states space
search problem to on optimization

4
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,530
problem, by saying that we want the best value
for the heuristic function. And

5
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,640
essentially, we are developing these local
search algorithms, to explore the surface

6
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,359
define
by the heuristic function, which we are now

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:48,170
calling evaluation function. Because, that
is

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,920
for the optimizing community call set. And
looking for minimum and maximum value,

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,129
as a case maybe…
And because we are exploring local search

10
00:00:57,128 --> 00:01:02,308
algorithms, which means that, the algorithm
will not necessarily search the entire space.

11
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:09,000
But, we will terminate, using some criteria
before that especially. We have the problem

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,659
of local optimum. And essentially, we are
exploring these different algorithms to try

13
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:25,000
and get around this problem of local optima.
Because, the simplest algorithm that we saw

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,420
hill climbing is very efficient, it requires
very little space.

15
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,540
.In fact, a constant space or being search
for that matter, which also requires constant

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,110
space. And it will just go up the slop and
stop. It will not take an exponential amount

17
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:41,730
of
time. But, the travel is that. That is not,

18
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,630
what we want? We want an global optima, which
will not be the maxima, that the hill climbing

19
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:52,500
will find. So, we have looking at ways of
getting around or getting beyond those local

20
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,840
optima’s. So, therefore one method that
we

21
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:05,490
saw in the last class was . essentially.
And we have said that, hill climbing we will

22
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:15,150
associate with exploitation. And by this,
we

23
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,590
mean exploitation of the heuristic function
or exploitation of the local knowledge or

24
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,430
the
gradient, that you can measure the gradient

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:30,549
around you. And you will always follow the
steepest gradient path. And this, we will

26
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:39,480
term as the exploitation of the gradient
essentially. Now, optimization does not happen

27
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,738
only in the computational world,
essentially I mean.

28
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:52,158
There is optimization happening in the physical
world as well and in nature as well. We

29
00:02:52,158 --> 00:02:57,370
will see some examples from nature and from
physical world. So, in physical world for

30
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:08,819
example, when we talk of materials, you want
to produce materials of certain quality.

31
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:18,138
And very often, this quality is dictated by
the way, it is atoms are arranged. So, for

32
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:24,069
example, if atoms are arranged in the nice
array like structure, then you get good

33
00:03:24,068 --> 00:03:33,098
crystalline materials or if atoms are arranged
to the close to each other in a metal, then

34
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,668
or
in a ceramic. Then, you get material, which

35
00:03:36,669 --> 00:03:43,680
has good properties like good strength of
material and things like that. Now, the way

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:53,049
to arrive at materials with good properties,
very often involves creating a liquid version

37
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,079
of that material and then solidifying, it
is

38
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:04,200
essentially. So, casting for example, you
make a mould. And then you melt the material

39
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,548
from which we want to make the cast.
And pole the material in to the mould. And

40
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,049
then it solidified and takes the shape of
the

41
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:19,639
cast essentially. This is how, many of the
. statue that you see, are

42
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,759
made essentially. And there are many other
things, which are made by casting. Now, as

43
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,219
I
said, the properties of these materials is

44
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,500
dictated by the way, that these atoms are
arranged in the… And it is desirable to

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,589
arrange the atoms in a systematic fashion,
which

46
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:48,409
in other words corresponds to low energy levels,
essentially.

47
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:58,120
So, you want the final form to have low energy.
And in that sense, you have a

48
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:11,050
minimization problem. So, materials you want
to be in minimum energy state. So, you

49
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:22,840
.can imagine that, if some material is in
gaseous form, it is got some maximum amount

50
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,849
of
random movements happening and more energy.

51
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,879
And as it becomes liquid, the energy
levels come down. And as it become solid,

52
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:33,730
the energy levels come down.
But, even in solids if we can arrange the

53
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,950
matter in to minimum energy levels, then we
get

54
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:38,719
good properties of materials.
.

55
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:50,870
And typically, the process that is used for
minimum energy is call, annealing. And by

56
00:05:50,870 --> 00:06:00,399
annealing, we basically mean controlled cooling.
That you do not allow to cool the

57
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:06,179
material, at it is own space or in some sense.
But, you make it cool slowly at a control

58
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,189
rate. So, that the atoms settle down in to
the minimum energy state. So, annealing is

59
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:15,600
a
physical process of minimization, which is

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,100
a kind of an optimization problem, that we
are also talking about. And we will take some

61
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,060
inspiration from annealing, in a few
moments.

62
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
..

63
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:39,149
You know some ethic called as random walk,
which we associate with exploration. So,

64
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:45,639
random walk as a name suggest is that, you
take a step in any random direction or make

65
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,110
a move to any random neighbor essentially.
And there is no other no criteria, which will

66
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,110
tell you which neighbor to move to essentially.
Now, hill climbing you generate the

67
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:06,590
neighbors of a given candidate. Inspect the
evaluation heuristic values or evaluation

68
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,299
function values, objective function values.
And choose a best amongst them and move to

69
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,430
that essentially. Random walk is simply
just taking a step in any random direction

70
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,650
essentially. Now, obviously you can see that,
random work has it is property of exploring

71
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,419
the states space or the search space,
whichever the search space. It could be the

72
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,250
solution space. But, of course it will not
be

73
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,379
guided. It will not have any desire to reach
our state, still at maximize essentially.

74
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:38,550
Just
keep going one and one.

75
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,710
So, when deterministic way that we saw of
going beyond maxima in hill climbing, we

76
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:50,359
saw was Tabu search. But, today we want to
look at a non deterministic or the stochastic

77
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,610
or randomized approach to exploring the space.
And our goal is to have a judicious mix

78
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:04,990
of exploration and exploitation. Exploration,
because it is exploration which will stop

79
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,670
us
from getting stock at local optima, and exploitation,

80
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:13,530
because it is exploitation which
takes us to optima in the first place essentially.

81
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:19,509
.So, it is just at what we want to reach the
global optimize, as far as possible. So, we

82
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,310
do
not want to have pure exploitation. Because,

83
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,670
we could have started in the wrong place
and you would end up in a local optimize.

84
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,590
So, as I mentioned in the end of the last
class,

85
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:38,639
we would want to make a move with a certain
probability, which is control in such a

86
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:44,500
fashion. That if the move is a good move,
then the probability is high. And if the move

87
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,789
is
not a good move, then the probability is low.

88
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:48,789
.

89
00:08:48,789 --> 00:09:03,509
So, we will use the notation c as current,
as we did in the last class, current node

90
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:12,129
and n as
a next node. In hill climbing, n is the best

91
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:17,879
amongst the neighbors. In random walk, n is
any random neighbor of c. So, there is a relation

92
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,710
between c. So, this is c and then there
are many possible neighbors. And one of them

93
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:38,360
is n. Associated with this c and this n, we
will have their heuristic values or evaluation

94
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:46,050
values, which you can call as a eval c for
this node c.

95
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:57,149
Therefore, node n we will have eval n. And
if we have maximizing, then we want eval n

96
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:02,480
to be greater than eval c. If we want minimizing,
then we wanted to be smaller

97
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,680
essentially. So, which means that hill climbing
would have chosen the one with the

98
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,389
maximum eval n and value around here. But,
now we are given up this strategy of

99
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:17,899
inspecting all of them, and then choosing
the best amongst them.

100
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:24,959
We are inside adopting a strategy, in which
you will just take of random neighbor and

101
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,019
either move to it or not move to it, essentially.
So, this is the choice, we will make that.

102
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:34,329
.We will either move from c to n or we will
remain at c, which means that at, we will

103
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,620
generate another random neighbor at that point.
And again, either move to that or not

104
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,019
move to that. It is a little bit difference
from, what we have been doing so far, essentially.

105
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:52,879
In random walk, we always move with 100 percent
surety to the next neighbor. But, we

106
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,639
do not want to do that. We want to move with
a certain probability. And the probability

107
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,500
should be such that, for good moves it should
be high and good move. So, we will

108
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:16,350
associate that term delta E as eval n minus
eval c. And the equation, that I am going

109
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,440
to
write is going to be for maximization. And

110
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,270
you can just flip the sign for minimization
essentially.

111
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:31,240
So, this delta is something that, we want
our probability to be influence by. So, should

112
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,440
we make this move from c to n? It depends
upon, what is the delta E is? If delta E is

113
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,721
positive, then I would more likely want to
make a move with the high probability. If

114
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:48,460
delta E is negative, which means that n is
worst than c. I would still want to allow

115
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,570
that
move to be made, because that is our goal

116
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,440
to get of maximum essentially. We do not
want to stuck at maximum.

117
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:00,500
So, we will allow even bad moves, which means
with negative delta E to be made but,

118
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:10,549
with a lower probability essentially. So,
the function that we will use for computing

119
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:14,009
this
probability will be a function of delta E.

120
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,769
And one more parameter, which will be you
will

121
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:24,029
used to control, how this delta E is influences
the probabilities essentially? So, we want

122
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,059
two things. The delta E should influence the
probability. And secondly, I want to control

123
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:36,219
how delta E influences probably?
Did any one give a thought to this function?

124
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,480
Or you might have write about it, some way.
So, the function that I will use… So, what

125
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,870
is the nature of this function? We want the
function of delta E. The function should be

126
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,169
range should be limited to one. It should
be

127
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:55,179
between 0 and 1, essentially. Because, it
is a probability, we want to measure. We want

128
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:59,259
to get a probability measure. It is domain
should be infinite, practically infinite.

129
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:04,639
Because, I am not going to put any constraint
on, how much is the difference between

130
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,789
the evaluation function of two nodes? It could
be a, to any degree essentially. So, we

131
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:18,889
want a function, which will stay within this.
So, let me draw that function here. I mean,

132
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:30,110
let me draw the domain at least. So, this
is what my destiny is... So, this is going

133
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,110
to be 1,

134
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:39,269
.this is going to be 0. And here, let us say
delta E is equal to 0. And here, delta E is

135
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:44,289
increasing. And here, in the opposite direction
it is decreasing essentially.

136
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:51,559
Delta E is equal to 0 means, the next node
is as the same value as the current node

137
00:13:51,559 --> 00:13:57,459
essentially. So, obviously you can imagine
that, you do not want to, you do not care.

138
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,360
You
can move to it or you do not move to it. You

139
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,090
are getting the same evaluation function
essentially. So, we want the function which

140
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:05,240
is going to be a monotonically increasing,
as

141
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,289
you go from left to right but, stay within
these nodes. So, you can imagine. They could

142
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:15,240
be. There is more than one function, that
you can choose to do that.

143
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
.

144
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:26,709
We will choose one. And that function is called
the sigmoid function. So, we will write

145
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:36,209
this as the following that P. It is the probability
of making the move. So, let me just say P

146
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:41,220
c n. If we interpreted, as saying that P c
n is a probability of making a move from c

147
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:56,970
to n
is 1 over 1 plus. This is basically the sigma

148
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,250
at function. And like as I said, we will have
a

149
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,339
second parameter, which will allow us to control,
how much delta E influences the

150
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:14,820
probability?
Because, we should be able to work at any

151
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,600
in some sense, place in this spectrum. And
the

152
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,580
spectrum starts with hill climbing, which
means that the moment delta E is positive.

153
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,440
You
will accept it, with probability one. The

154
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,420
moment that is negative. You will reject it,
with

155
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,819
probability one or accept it with probability
zero. And on the other hand is a random

156
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:35,320
.work at the other extreme, which means that
it does not care, whether delta E is positive

157
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,000
or negative.
You will always accept it with probability

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,259
0.5. But, we want to be able to operate,
anywhere in this range essentially. So, we

159
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:57,269
need a second parameter. And the second
parameter, traditionally is call T essentially.

160
00:15:57,269 --> 00:16:05,149
So, this is a simple algorithm, generate.
So,

161
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:19,159
n is a random neighbor 
of c. So, let us assume. You have a function

162
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:28,778
called random
neighbor of c. And then we say eval delta

163
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:34,580
E.
According to this formula, eval n minus eval

164
00:16:34,580 --> 00:17:02,830
c and move with probability. So, it is a little
bit like the random work. Accepts, if I may

165
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:10,170
use the analogy of somebody being
inebriated. This person is little bit too

166
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,980
inebriated. That sometimes, he does not even
make

167
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,519
a move .. So, sometimes he makes a move, sometimes
does not

168
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,730
make a move. So, sometimes he goes some c
to n and sometimes, he just stays there and

169
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,500
after while, he makes another moves and some
other moves essentially.

170
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:34,000
This algorithm is call stochastic hill climbing.
So, I will just write HC for hill climbing.

171
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,039
It is not purely hill climbing. Hill climbing
would only go in the direction of the steepest

172
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:49,629
radiant. But, it has a tendency to go in the
direction of better values. So, we have still

173
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,880
talking about maximization. So, it still has
a tendency to go up. So, let us inspect some

174
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,420
values, which I have got from this book. So,
how to solve it by .?

175
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:09,350
So, there given some examples. So, I am just
taking their example.

176
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,349
.

177
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:31,839
.So, what is the effect of delta E. Let us
assume that, T equal to 10, some value. And

178
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:34,480
we
are using that, value 10 here to compute this

179
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:48,460
delta E essentially. And let us assume that,
eval c is equal to 107, some value. And values

180
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,090
better than 107 are good, values less than
107 are bad for this essentially. So, let

181
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,449
construct a small table of values and say,
how it

182
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:07,590
effects? So, this is a value for eval n. So,
if this is 80. That means, it is a not a good

183
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:18,889
value.
It is less than 107. So, delta E so I write

184
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:24,390
minus delta E here. Minus delta E is 27. Then,
e

185
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:41,090
raise to minus delta E by T, e’s value is
14.88. And this is the probability. This is

186
00:19:41,089 --> 00:19:48,959
0.06.
So, if according to this formula, and this

187
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,200
function is called sigmoid function. If my
eval n

188
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,590
equal to 80, then I will move to it to the
very small probability, as you can see 0.06

189
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:04,169
essentially. So, 6 times out of 100, I will
move to that node. Otherwise, I will not move

190
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,279
to that.
And that is, what we want essentially. You

191
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:13,210
want the search to focus more towards better
moves and less towards, you see. Let us look

192
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:20,160
at some more examples. If this is 100, this
is little bit better. This becomes 7, this

193
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,290
becomes 2.01 and this becomes 0.33. So, we
are

194
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,399
studying the effect of, how this function
sigmoid function response to changing delta

195
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,640
E
essentially? So, this is still a bad value

196
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,990
because, we are starting with eval c equal
to 107.

197
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:41,870
We are still going 7 points lower. And it
will moving to that with one third probabilities,

198
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:50,599
essentially. Then, just for the sake of completion,
you take this. This happens to be 1.0

199
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:59,830
and 0.50, which is nice. Because, what this
function is telling us? Is that, if eval n

200
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,199
equal
to eval c you may or may not move to that,

201
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,960
which means you move to that probability
0.5. And you can stay back at with probability

202
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:13,279
0.5, which is what we would expect?
Now, let us took at better values 120, which

203
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:29,129
becomes minus 13, 0.27 and 0.78. So, if you
find the better value, then we will move to

204
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,190
with probability 0.78. How do you move it
to

205
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,900
the probability 0.78? We discuss at the last
class. You generate .

206
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:45,200
number in the range 0 to 1. And if that number
is less than 0.78, you move. Otherwise,

207
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:55,410
you do not move essentially. Less, you know
equal to 0.78. One more value 150, which

208
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:12,740
is much better.
So, this table basically which I have taken

209
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,319
from this book. Illustrates, how stochastic
hill

210
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:28,509
climbing response to different values of delta
E. As you can see, if delta E is high and

211
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:33,058
what you have written here is negation of
delta E. If delta E is high, if we get a good

212
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:35,950
.improvement, it makes some move with greater
probability. Otherwise, it makes a move

213
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:54,970
with the lesser probability. All this is for,
this value of T equal to 10 essentially.

214
00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:02,339
How do you choose this value? It is a next
question, because we will see in a moment.

215
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,928
What is a influence of T essentially? I will,
let us first finish that and then we will

216
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,890
do the
discussion. So, now let us assume that we

217
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:21,970
have looking at this case. So, not this case.
We

218
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:35,220
are looking at this case, which is the better
case. And let us see that if eval n equal

219
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:41,150
to 120
and of course, eval c is 107, how does temperature

220
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:47,850
affects the probability?
So, let us look at different values of T.

221
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:54,449
Then, we have e is to minus 13 by T. And then
we

222
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:03,450
have probability P. So, let us take a low
value and we will assume, 1 is a low value.

223
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:12,750
This
comes to and you can do this yourself actually.

224
00:24:12,750 --> 00:25:22,929
So, let me first write out this values. With
5, it is... So, this is how temperature of

225
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:41,050
it is, this. So, I have used our term temperature.
And in fact, that there is a connection with

226
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:47,168
annealing, that we will shortly see.
So, we will call this parameter, temperature.

227
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:52,090
And delta E is also stand for energy in some
sense. Of course, in this case you want to

228
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:57,168
maximize. Otherwise, you would have a
formula in which, this goes to negation of…

229
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:03,740
Instead of minus delta E, you would have
plus delta E, if you wanted to minimize. So,

230
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:10,429
how does this behave? Let us see. At very
low temperature or very low value of T, the

231
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:16,320
probability is 1. So, you can see that, this
is

232
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:22,909
like hill climbing.
If you keep this parameter low, then it tends

233
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,509
to behave like hill climbing. Well, in the
sense that if you see the better more, it

234
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:34,240
will make it essentially. Then, as temperature
increases and this is where the analogy with

235
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,400
real world materials comes in to play. The
energy levels increase. The entropy keeps

236
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:46,900
increasing and so on so forth. Or randomness
keeps in improving. And at very, very high

237
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:54,130
temperatures, this is 10 is to 10.
The probability is 0.5. And you can see that,

238
00:26:54,130 --> 00:27:14,770
there is a bit like random walk. So, we can
control the behavior of our probability function

239
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:21,359
by controlling temperature. If you want it
to be more random, we will keep high temperature.

240
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,750
So, as you are above 0.5, it is
approaching a random walk. It is more random

241
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,240
essentially. Irrespective of, what value of
delta E is? It will be 0.5 essentially. So,

242
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:38,759
it will be randomly make a move essentially.
If you wanted to make it, so if you want to

243
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:44,019
explore more, you keep the temperature high,
making to behave like a random walk. If you

244
00:27:44,019 --> 00:27:47,079
wanted to follow the radiant, then keep the

245
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,500
.temperature low. Making it, behave like a
little bit like hill climbing, essentially.

246
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,659
If it
sees that, well hill climbing in the sense,

247
00:27:53,659 --> 00:27:55,620
hill climbing always moves to a better spot.
The

248
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:58,219
actual algorithm moves to the best amongst
them.

249
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:02,009
But, since we are generating only one, we
will take this as an approximation to hill

250
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:09,900
climbing. So, it would move only, if the node
n was better than node c, if temperature

251
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,780
was low. If temperature was high, it would
less move, irrespective of whether. So, as

252
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:16,519
an
exercise I would ask you to look at, either

253
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,869
of these values and construct the table for
T.

254
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:22,369
And you will see that, there would be similar
thing. That they would, at high temperature

255
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:29,428
they will, it will still converts to 0.5 and
at low temperatures, it will converts to zero,

256
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,429
towards zero. Then, it will not move it all,
essentially. If we are getting a worst, these

257
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:36,480
two values are worst in this and these two
values are better than this, essentially.

258
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,870
So, we
have noted. We have seen the example of a

259
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:47,620
better value.
So, how does this sigmoid function look? If

260
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:52,210
you are to plot it, it depends on the
parameter temperature .. So, let us say, this

261
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,579
is the value of 0.5
through this. So, this is all curves was passed

262
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:04,939
to this point, essentially. Why because? We
have said here that when delta E is equal

263
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,788
to 0, it gives us a value of 0.5. When, you
can

264
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:12,529
see that, this is going to be irrespective
of temperature, because this term has become

265
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:14,990
zero ..
So, irrespective of temperature, this value

266
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:23,200
is going to be 0.5. So, all the curves for
temperatures will pass through .. When temperature

267
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,080
is low, this
curve looks like this.

268
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:29,079
..

269
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:46,548
Basically the step function. This is T equal
to 1. When temperature is high, this curve

270
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:58,908
looks like a straight line, here. This is,
what T equal to, this is 10 is to 10. It is

271
00:29:58,909 --> 00:30:02,669
always
0.5. Otherwise, it gives us a behavior, which

272
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:09,350
looks like the following. So, a typical
sigmoid curve will cross this at some place

273
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:16,689
and then go down towards zero here. And go
up towards one place. So, this is a typical

274
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,890
shape of a sigmoid curve.
And it is nice for us, because we want a function,

275
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:30,970
which will have the range of 0 to 1 and
domain which is infinite. And as we change

276
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:37,058
the values of temperature, the shape of this
curve, changes. So, with a different temperature,

277
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:49,039
the curve may look like this. So, as
temperature goes down, this curve, this slope

278
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:59,220
become sharper and sharper, like this. And
as the temperature goes up, it becomes flatter

279
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,690
and flatter essentially.
So, this is T raises to 10 is to 10. Somewhere,

280
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:08,900
you know there will be a curve, which will
be like this. So, there is a series of curves.

281
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:18,250
So, this is a direction of increasing T. The
curves become flatter as T. This is just a

282
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,919
nature of this function. We are just looking
at it,

283
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:27,850
to get some insides and towards happening
essentially. Now, instead of saying that,

284
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:31,409
I will
make a choice of the value T. We follow, what

285
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:40,750
is done in the physical world, which is to
say that, I will cool down the system gradually.

286
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,910
And hope that, it will settle into an
optimal state essentially.

287
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:47,910
..

288
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:58,460
So, if we remove this and put in a clause,
where we initialize T into some values, let

289
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:08,669
us
say very high. Whatever that very high value

290
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:19,380
is… And very often, the algorithm has two
loops. There is one loop in which, you do

291
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,640
this loop a few times at a constant T. Some
people, call it as e power something. But,

292
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,860
that does not a matter. It is a inner loop,
in

293
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:31,979
which you do this whole process. What is this
process?

294
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,460
Generating a random neighbor and either, moving
to it and not moving to it, depending

295
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:41,240
on how good that neighbor is given by this
probability here, essentially. You keep doing,

296
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:56,038
this as a certain number of types. And then
you change T from monotonic decreasing

297
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:09,169
function. So, something, some function. The
simplest is, T is equal to T minus 1. But,

298
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:12,870
that may not necessarily with the best function,
you know. This is a very empirical

299
00:33:12,869 --> 00:33:20,168
process.
This function, that we are looking for determines.

300
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:33,570
What this people call it as a cooling
lead. And this is, at most of the times determined

301
00:33:33,569 --> 00:33:39,548
empirically essentially, which means
that you take a domain, do some experiments

302
00:33:39,548 --> 00:33:45,519
and try to see, what works and what does
not work and then try to keep that value.

303
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,028
And then this is a outer loop. So, you do
in an

304
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:57,440
inner loop, you do this some number of steps.
Then, you decrease the temperature and do

305
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,640
some more number of steps essentially.
So, what is the intuition behind this? And

306
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:12,108
simulated annealing. So, it is called simulated
annealing. It is a algorithm, very well known

307
00:34:12,108 --> 00:34:14,340
algorithm call simulated annealing. It is

308
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:19,889
.very popular in the optimization community.
It is used very often. And this is basically

309
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,429
the algorithm. That you started at the high
temperature, which means you start with high

310
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:28,539
random movement. Allow the system to go to
any candidate.

311
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:36,099
But, gradually bring down the temperature
and make it behave more and more like, hill

312
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:39,579
climbing. What would be the intuition? Why
should it work? What is the idea behind this

313
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:47,210
decreasing of temperature? How does it help?
Decreasing the random means, therefore it

314
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:52,320
does. But, what is the intuition behind? Why
does it work? Why does it help us find,

315
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,280
good values good.
Student: . local meaning.

316
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:05,849
But, remember that towards the end, when T
becomes low, it is going to behave more

317
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:14,609
and more like hill climbing. How do you account
for that fact? It is true that, initially

318
00:35:14,608 --> 00:35:18,519
we
wanted to behave randomly. And then later

319
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:26,349
on we wanted to follow the heuristic function
or all essentially. What is changing over

320
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:28,830
this period of time?
Student: .

321
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:39,650
If that is high initially, why do you want
this high initially and what is the effect

322
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,838
of this
cooling? You know, I heard that somebody say

323
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:49,769
that, this is like one of those toys, which
has the concerting rings. We might have seen

324
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:55,730
with some small balls of wall bearing like
objects inside them. And you have to move

325
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,659
them all towards the center. And this person
who is a respected computer scientist said

326
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,480
that, you know.
It is a bit like, you first move it randomly

327
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,440
and then gradually. You let it try to control
the

328
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,200
movement. But, you think that object will
little bit or something like that. So, let

329
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:20,639
we give
you an intuition behind this. So, what is

330
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,719
the claim that we are making? The claim that
we

331
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:27,719
are making is that, at many problems this
gives us very good solutions, which means

332
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,329
it
gives us close to optimal solutions essentially.

333
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:36,319
What are the kind of problems, where this
works, were the surface is gadget essentially.

334
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,240
Where hill climbing would have got stuck at
first local maxima or minimize, it is found?

335
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:47,509
But, this algorithm can get beyond many local
maxima and move towards better maxima.

336
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:53,740
So, what is an intuition to say that, it moves
towards better maxima? So, this is a basic

337
00:36:53,739 --> 00:36:58,899
.idea that, I would not make you to think
about. Let us assume that, that is… So,

338
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,869
there is
this big gadgets surface.

339
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:01,869
.

340
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:11,530
So, let us say. This is how your one dimensional
surface looks like, essentially. Its gadget

341
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,839
in the sense that, hill climbing would, depending
on where it is started, hill climbing

342
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:18,769
would have got stuck in one of these local
maxima. But, we are saying that something

343
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:24,690
like simulated annealing, will go very close
to the global maxima, essentially. So, the

344
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:32,440
idea is this essentially. That, take a certain
snap shot of this, which looks like this.

345
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:41,070
It is like that, one of these things here.
Let us call this point A and next, call this

346
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:46,760
point as
B and next call this point C. And we want

347
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,300
to maximize which means, we want this value
to be high, higher. We want to go to C rather

348
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,760
than to A. We want to go to the top of this
essentially. Now, in this one dimensional

349
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,240
world which means, you know these are the
set

350
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,559
of candidates and these are the heuristic
functions and you can move either left or

351
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,150
right.
You want to not get stuck at A but, you want

352
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,090
to be at C. And then this I have given to
apply all over this slope, essentially here.

353
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:22,740
Now, you can see that, to move from A to B,
it

354
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:30,279
has to overcome an energy gap, which is this
much, which means when I say overcome

355
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:38,109
the energy gap, basically I am saying that,
it is going against the heuristic function.

356
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:40,569
You
want to maximize but, you want to go down

357
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,570
here.

358
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,430
.You want to go down here, maybe two three
steps depending on, what is the granularity?

359
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:49,710
You want to take two three steps down there
and end up in B. And of course, then after

360
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,880
that, it will have a natural tendency to go
up because, that is the natural tendency of

361
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,320
this
algorithm. If it sees a better move, as we

362
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,109
have seen here .. The
better the delta E, the better the probability

363
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:06,098
of moving to that move, essentially.
So, it is a natural tendency of going here.

364
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:11,960
So, to go from… So, let us call this E AB.
And

365
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:26,300
likewise, let us call this E CB. To go from
A to C, it has to overcome an energy gap of

366
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,510
E
AB. To go from C to A, it has to overcome

367
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,960
an energy gap of E CB. So, just imagine that,
there is somebody with the helium balloon

368
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,039
tied to that first. Let us try to visualize,
trying

369
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,309
to pull him up essentially. So, he has to
walk down all this way. Pulling that helium

370
00:39:44,309 --> 00:39:50,840
balloon which is a greater distance, essentially.
So, a greater energy gap essentially. So,

371
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,450
to go to from A to C, you have to overcome
this

372
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:56,848
energy gap. And then of course, naturally
the algorithm will take you up, because it

373
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:02,230
has
this tendency of going up. To go from C to

374
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,869
A, you have to emerge the greater energy gap
essentially, which is this E CB essentially.

375
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:18,610
As you works for this, you can certain
comment. The idea, which says that, there

376
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,680
is a greater chance of it, moving from A to
C,

377
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,210
essentially.
In general, not initially. Initially, when

378
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,108
the temperature is high, going up and going
down

379
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:31,159
is all the same for this algorithm. It will
just do any more randomly. But, as the

380
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,670
temperature goes lower and lower, it is still
not hill climbing. It is still some intermediate

381
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:40,539
temperature. But, either intermediate temperature
as you can see, ..

382
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:45,358
The probabilities, unfortunately we have drawn
the probabilities for negative moves.

383
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:50,619
But, maybe we should do that and see that.
That, as the temperature goes down, the

384
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:55,150
probability of making negative moves goes
down essentially. As a temperature becomes

385
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,240
one, the probability or negative moves tends
to zero essentially. So, as a temperature

386
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:08,769
goes down, the probability of moving some
energy gap will depend on the energy gap

387
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:13,199
essentially, And since this gap is larger
than this. It is no likely, that algorithm

388
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:15,439
will go for
A to B and then to C.

389
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,429
And remember that, B to C is a kind of automatic.
Like in the sense, there is a most

390
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:25,129
likely behavior, because of this thing. And
it is less slightly, it is come down from

391
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,280
C to
B. And then go to A essentially. And this

392
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,960
is specially the case, as temperature is brought

393
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,710
.down essentially. So, you can see in some
sense, you can see that temperature it is

394
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:40,720
ability
to go down in this slope essentially. As temperature

395
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,309
is high, the algorithm has higher
ability to go down or you can say, go down

396
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:48,909
greater distance essentially.
As we gradually reduce the temperature, it

397
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:54,889
is ability to go down in this. Remember, this
is maximization problem. Decrease this, which

398
00:41:54,889 --> 00:42:01,690
means that it is easier for it to go from
A

399
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:09,010
to B, then it is come from C to B, which means
that it is more likely to end up in C.

400
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:13,470
Because, after the temperature has become
really down. If it happens to be here, it

401
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:15,899
will
go to C. If it happens to be here, it will

402
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,900
go to A essentially.
That is hill climbing part of it, essentially.

403
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:27,840
So, this is a kind of intuition behind simulated
annealing. That initially, you allow the algorithm

404
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:34,160
to explore many different parts. But,
gradually bring down the temperature. In the

405
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:39,088
process, in some sense pushing it towards
the global maxima, essentially. Pushing it

406
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:46,559
towards higher peeks, in this example
essentially. Why because? It is at any given

407
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,449
temperature, which is not infinite.
I mean, if you assume 10 is to 10 is infinite.

408
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:59,309
It is more likely that, it will climb down
form it is local peek, then it is from a higher

409
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,949
peek, which means it is more likely, that
it is

410
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,879
a little climb up to the higher peek from
a local peek, which means that this is very

411
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,710
likely, that it will go from A to C essentially
at any given temperature. And eventually,

412
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,800
you bring the temperature down. So, that it
is a kind of just goes to that nearest peek

413
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:20,900
that
it is that.

414
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:33,599
Actually, there is a simpler version of randomize
algorithm, which I have not mention.

415
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:43,079
But, this is probably a good time to mention
it. That algorithm is called iterated hill

416
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:54,920
climbing. And what it essentially does? And
this is, this works in the solution space.

417
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,110
So,
something like, if you are solving sat or

418
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,370
solving TSPS or something like that, where
you

419
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:03,139
are looking for a solution. You are not looking
for a path from the start state to the goal

420
00:44:03,139 --> 00:44:05,130
state.
In fact, that there is no notion of go start

421
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,969
state. So, . for examples.
There is no start. Unless of course, you think

422
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:11,179
of the empty board as a start state. But,
that

423
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:15,169
is not really critical to the solving the
problem. So, if you want to solve ((Refer

424
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,389
Time:
44:16)). You have to find with the final solution,

425
00:44:16,389 --> 00:44:21,509
somehow with the other essentially.
And so when we look at the solution space

426
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:25,950
search and perturbation methods, you could
start at any random location, essentially.

427
00:44:25,949 --> 00:44:30,659
.So, again consider SAT as a example. You
can choose any supposing, you have n

428
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:34,489
variables. You could choose any assignment
for those n variables. And that is a starting

429
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:39,538
point from which you apply those operators,
that we discussed earlier, essentially.

430
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:40,539
.

431
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:49,880
So, what iterated hill climbing says? You
essentially, that choose a random state of

432
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,490
starting point random means. So, in this example,
it would mean choose one here, choose

433
00:44:56,489 --> 00:45:08,519
one here, choose one here, choose one here
and so on. So, put it in some kind of a loop.

434
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:19,909
Choose random start. And simply do hill climbing.
Do not do anything else. Just do hill

435
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:26,069
climbing. So, you can imagine that, if I want
to do this, then this starting point will

436
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,070
take
me to this maximum.

437
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,380
This starting point will take me to this maximum
and so on and so forth. And if you have

438
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,670
chosen a sufficiently large number of random
starting points, then one of them is likely

439
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,240
to hit global maxima, essentially. So, that
is a hope. Of course, it depends on the nature

440
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,598
of the surface. If it is very gadget, then
you may need many, many starting points. But,

441
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:49,230
if
the surface is like this, then you can see

442
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:54,909
that if we start anywhere between this range,
means anywhere here and you will end up with

443
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:57,759
this global maxima essentially.
So, iterated hill climbing is very simple

444
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:05,670
algorithm. It says that, do many hill climbing
searches. But, start at different randomly

445
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:08,099
selected points and because, hill climbing
is

446
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,300
simple. Computationally, this algorithm is
simple essentially. You can also think of

447
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:17,430
this
as a parallel search. That you start all these

448
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,309
searches at the same time and all of them

449
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:23,210
.happens in the same time. So, after the end,
you will just find what is the best candidate

450
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:34,710
that you got? And you, that is an answer essentially.
So, there is something to be said with more

451
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:38,769
than one candidate, searching with more than
one candidates. So, we have already seen a

452
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:47,338
couple of examples. Beam search, searches
through. Always selects be best candidates

453
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,440
in the next level and so on, if remember.
This

454
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,639
is little bit like beam search. In the sense
that, except that you ,these things are not

455
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,119
allowed to interact with each other.
So, this will have its own trajectory and

456
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:03,130
this will have its own trajectory and so on.
But,

457
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:15,039
they are the be parallel searches taking place,
essentially. Does it make sense for two

458
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:21,630
candidates to interact in some way? If you
are doing a search in which, there are many

459
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,690
candidates like a parallel search, like this.
Does it make sense for two candidates to

460
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:32,831
interact? We will address that, in the next
class which will be and we will stop here,

461
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,809
with
this. So, that is a new algorithm that we

462
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:38,320
will look at, which is based on working with
a

463
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:50,390
population of candidates, which are allowed
to interact with each other in some sense,

464
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:56,338
essentially. We will stop here.

465
00:47:56,338 --> 00:48:06,338
.
