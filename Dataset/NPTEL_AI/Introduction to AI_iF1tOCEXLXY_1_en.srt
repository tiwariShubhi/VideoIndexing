1
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:29,259
No one; you heard about this creature; kirobo
is a small robot, 34 centimeter; it comes

2
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,730
to
about your knee or something; build by Japan,

3
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:42,859
needless to say, it is Japanese based ahead
of the rest of the world in robotics.

4
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,829
And, this robot has been sent to space on
Sunday that

5
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:49,179
is how it came into news.

6
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:54,030
If you are watching some news channel, well,
but may be BBC

7
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,939
or something else, the Japanese space agency
has sent this robot into space.

8
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:09,728
It is a small robot which can recognize speech,
understand what you are saying, talk back

9
00:01:09,728 --> 00:01:13,079
and recognize faces, and so on, exactly.

10
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:21,810
And, the idea is that this robot will be a
companion for a Japanese astronaut who is

11
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:29,560
scheduled to go in November sometime; and,
that is an interesting idea, robots as companions

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,560
of people.

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
..

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,109
.
So, if you remember, we had talked about,

15
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:39,839
I had mentioned about this chess grandmaster
David Levy.

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:52,079
In 1968 he had a chess bet we had talked about
this in the last class.

17
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,019
And, he
had said that no program can beat him for

18
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,399
the next 10 years which he luckily survived
the bet.

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:14,050
Because, now as we know, chess playing programs
are much better, but in 2008

20
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:20,110
he is talking about robot companions.

21
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:36,920
So, he is come from one end of the pendulum
in which he believe that chess, a program,

22
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:42,938
a computer program could not do anything interesting,
to the other end where he believes

23
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:48,079
that robots can be companions to human beings.

24
00:02:48,080 --> 00:03:07,769
So, he wrote this book, it is called, it has
published in 2008, and the title of the book

25
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,939
is “Love and Sex with Robots”.

26
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:20,709
And, the idea behind the book is something
which many parts of the world now looking

27
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:27,019
at; specially those parts of the world which
have aging populations where they do not

28
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,360
have enough young to take care of the old.

29
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,690
But, of course, he is not talking of old here,
but where robots could take care of people.

30
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:40,818
So, robots can be companions and so on.

31
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:43,280
So,
that is the book he wrote in 2008.

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,430
And, for example, what looks like a young
lady,

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:58,090
whereas in fact, it is a robot, the thing
here.

34
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:07,270
So, this idea of creating robots in the image
of us has been around for a long time, and

35
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:13,969
we will look at some of this history today;
and, robotic companions could well be there

36
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:16,000
in the future essentially.

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,649
So, we saw in the last class; so, I just quickly
go over this.

38
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:25,209
These
are the syllabus which will be available in

39
00:04:25,209 --> 00:04:26,589
some place and the text books.

40
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:29,529
And, these are
the 2 books that we will be following in the

41
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:32,419
next couple of lectures – “AI: The Very

42
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:39,160
.Idea” by Haugeland and “Machines Who
Think” by Pamela McCorduck.

43
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,100
We saw some definitions of AI.

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,260
So, therefore, 4 things here - one is that
if they do

45
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,139
machines are intelligent, if they do things
which human beings are considered to be

46
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:58,089
intelligent for; another definition is that
AI is the enterprise of solving heart problems

47
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,859
and finding polynomial time solutions.

48
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,330
And, we must, of course, qualify that by saying
that these are approximate solutions, so,

49
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:09,159
or they are not necessarily optimal solutions.

50
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,510
And then, the AI, the study of mental faculties
by creating computation models that is the

51
00:05:14,509 --> 00:05:18,500
idea given by Sania Macdomote.

52
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,629
But, the idea, but the definition that we
like most is

53
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,259
given by Haugeland.

54
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:33,839
And, the definition says that AI is interested
in the idea of machines

55
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,369
with minds of their own essentially.

56
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,329
And, this is the idea that you will pursue
in the next

57
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:38,939
couple of lectures.

58
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:39,939
.

59
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:47,490
We asked some fundamental questions in the
last class - what is intelligence?

60
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,490
What is
thinking?

61
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,290
And, we got several responses here; what we
think is intelligent behavior?

62
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:58,479
So,
problem solving, reasoning, learning, perception

63
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,459
and language; language was mentioned
in the last class.

64
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,459
..

65
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,500
So, let me ask a question here.

66
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,769
Language is something which is unique to human
beings.

67
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:17,810
And, many people believe that it is instrumental
in intelligent behavior.

68
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,530
But, the question
that I want to ask is if you look at language

69
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:34,089
and thought, what came first?

70
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:52,629
So, he was
thinking because of the language or was language

71
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:53,889
was because of the thinking.

72
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,930
In the
sense, is that what ability to think dependent

73
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:07,030
upon the scale of language that we have, or
did language come because we are able to think?

74
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,119
So, let me see what people think here.

75
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,689
And, again I will emphasize that there is
no

76
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:19,680
correct answer to this question; in the sense
that it is like the chicken and egg problem.

77
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,220
But, what do students think?

78
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:30,140
And, I hope students from Monday will also
join in, with

79
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,879
their opinions.

80
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,060
Can we think without language?

81
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,839
Let me ask in this way.

82
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,769
Or, is thinking
closely tied to language?

83
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,370
You are saying, no; we can think without language.

84
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,780
So, can
you, sort of, justify, or support your answer?

85
00:07:52,779 --> 00:08:01,859
Student: Abstract thoughts we have; so, those
are not language; those are not language

86
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,449
dependent or something.

87
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:11,740
So, abstract thoughts are not language dependent;
now that is a, some more debatable

88
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,740
claim essentially.

89
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,579
So, the question I am asking really is that
our thoughts made up of

90
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:23,889
language, or all our thoughts, good thoughts
imply language; can we think without taking

91
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,500
recourse to language.

92
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:31,680
So, when you say language, we really mean
symbol because

93
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,279
language is just one kind of a symbol system
essentially.

94
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,319
Is it possible to think?

95
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,719
Now you
said graphics or visual images, yeah that

96
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,930
is the thing which comes to mind, that if
you

97
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:54,638
.recall visual images then you are not really
talking about words or things like that.

98
00:08:54,639 --> 00:09:06,879
Interestingly, you have heard of Chomsky,
right.

99
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,198
Yeah.

100
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:14,778
So, is there anyone who is not
heard of Noom Chomsky?

101
00:09:14,778 --> 00:09:17,919
What is he doing nowadays?

102
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,338
He visited India few years ago
as well.

103
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:29,270
So, he is actually become a political activist.

104
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,269
.

105
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:39,568
But, many years ago when he was active in
linguistics he put forward the idea of

106
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:49,818
universal grammar; so, UG, that it is called.

107
00:09:49,818 --> 00:09:58,458
And, he said that human beings are born
with grammar in their heads, whatever that

108
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:03,750
means in the heads, we will not explore that
question, but essentially our brains come

109
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:13,230
prewired with the faculty of linguistic ability
which is, sort of, some kind of a grammar.

110
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:19,959
And, what he says is that depending upon which
place, which society you grow up in,

111
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:25,669
you tune that grammar to that particular language
that exists in that society essentially.

112
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:36,110
So, Chomsky, of course, so, he is saying that
language came first; that we are born with

113
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,480
the ability to use language, and may be that
helped us, of course; he is not saying that,

114
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:47,180
but may be that helped us in our ability to
think essentially.

115
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:52,059
But, anyway that is an open
question; may be at later point I will come

116
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,059
back to it.

117
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,059
..

118
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,438
So, we also ask some question as to, what
is a machine?

119
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:00,059
Is the computer a machine?

120
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,609
And
we said that, yes, we will assume that; whenever

121
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:10,870
we talk of machines thinking we will be
talking about computer programs running.

122
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,129
And of course, we ask the question that, are
we machines; that is something you can found

123
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:18,379
over and some reactions to that.

124
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:19,379
.

125
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,450
.
So, historically there have been arguments

126
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,450
against thinking.

127
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,579
So, we had discussed 3
arguments by Dreyfus which says that there

128
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:30,789
is something intuitionistic going on in our
heads; something which is kind of intuition

129
00:11:30,789 --> 00:11:32,559
which we cannot define in terms of rules.

130
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,559
So,

131
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,248
.when Dreyfus was talking about all these
people, we were talking about rules as a

132
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:37,360
mechanism for reasoning.

133
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,149
And, he said that there is certain kind of
unconscious instincts

134
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,379
that we have which cannot be captured in rules
essentially.

135
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:52,320
John Searle, a philosopher, use the Chinese
Room argument; and he says the argument

136
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,870
was that just because he can manipulate symbols
and convince somebody that you are

137
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,629
doing something, like for example, children
doing long division.

138
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,220
Do they understand
when, whether, what is really, what are they

139
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,220
really doing.

140
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,759
Or, when even younger
children do addition; so, they add 2 numbers,

141
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,800
where looking up a table, do a carryover,
then add, and so on and so forth.

142
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:17,028
You are doing simple manipulations.

143
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,568
Are you
understanding, what is behind that activity

144
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:25,068
essentially?

145
00:12:25,068 --> 00:12:32,088
All older students, should I say, when they
are dealing with things like Fourier

146
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,089
transforms and so on and so forth, are you
doing it mechanically, or have you mugged

147
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,700
up
a formula of how to integrate something, or

148
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,149
do you understand what is happening behind
that decision.

149
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:48,799
So, what Searle says is that symbol manipulation,
the ability to manipulate

150
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,990
symbols is not necessarily a guarantee that
you are intelligent; maybe you are following

151
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,120
some rules which somebody has taught you;
this is how you add numbers and so on and

152
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,470
so forth.

153
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:07,410
And, Penrose, the celebrated scientist says
that there is something quantum mechanical

154
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:10,620
going on in our brains essentially.

155
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,139
So, there are other arguments based on emotion
in

156
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:18,039
intuition, consciousness, ethics, and so on
which we will ignore.

157
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,039
.

158
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:25,169
.Then, Alan Turing, and he said that the question
whether machines can think is

159
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:26,169
meaningless.

160
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:29,438
Let us not try an answer because first you
have to answer what is thinking

161
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:32,639
and only then you can say whether machines
can think essentially or not essentially.

162
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,509
He
said that let me prescribe a test which is

163
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:40,620
called as a imitation game, and which we now
called that Turing test.

164
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,669
And, at that time when he prescribed it in
this book that is mentioned in this slide

165
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,870
here, in
the paper that is mentioned here, „Computing

166
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,929
Machinery and Intelligence‟ appeared in
1950.

167
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:54,388
It is available on the link that is given
in the page.

168
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,080
He believed that in 50 years on
then which is in 2000, machines would be able

169
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,869
to pass his so called Turing test
essentially.

170
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:02,869
.

171
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:04,160
And, what is the test?

172
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,058
This is where we stopped in the last class.

173
00:14:06,058 --> 00:14:13,679
The test is that there is a
human judge sitting out there, interacting

174
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,388
over some medium; it could be nowadays a
mobile phone where you are chatting with someone;

175
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:25,299
or, in those days it was a teletype
which was connected to another room in which

176
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:30,699
the other person who was responding;
and what Turing said was that if that human

177
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:45,759
judge can confidently discriminate whether
the other side is man or a computer, then

178
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,068
the computer has failed the test.

179
00:14:50,068 --> 00:14:54,998
But, if the
computer can, most of the times convince the

180
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:59,808
judge that the judge is talking to a human
then the computer has passed the Turing test.

181
00:14:59,808 --> 00:15:05,708
So, this is what is known as a Turing test
of intelligence you might say, to test whether

182
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:10,349
system is intelligent you will pass it through
the Turing test and then decide whether it

183
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,350
is

184
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,350
.intelligent.

185
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,639
You do not ask, what you mean by thinking,
what is intelligence; and you

186
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,549
know that do not go into fundamentals.

187
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,479
And, as I said, there is a Loebner prize which
is

188
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:29,649
currently available; still now 100, 000 US
dollars to anybody who can pass the test,

189
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,649
so to
speak essentially.

190
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:35,269
So, the question which I left the class with
was, what you think of the Turing test as

191
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,948
a
test of intelligence?

192
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:46,109
Do you have any views on this?

193
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,110
Is it a good test?

194
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,240
Is it a bad test?

195
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,818
Do
you agree that if a computer passes a test

196
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:58,078
it will be considered to be intelligent, it
qualify

197
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,289
to be called intelligent?

198
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,909
Any thoughts on this?

199
00:16:06,909 --> 00:16:17,259
While you are thinking, meanwhile let me
address the mandy students.

200
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:24,129
So, welcome again, and the basic idea of the
first few lectures is that they are going

201
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:29,610
to be
a study of history and philosophy behind AI,

202
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,699
what has happened in the last few 100 years
which has led to the development of AI currently.

203
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:41,129
And, after those 2 or 3 lectures we will
have a qualitative shift, and we will spend

204
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:45,588
most of the time using algorithms, using the
syllabus which I will convey to you essentially.

205
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:51,619
So, is it a good test or a bad test?

206
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,800
Surely
you can have some opinion.

207
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,799
Yes.

208
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:09,079
Student: I mean you cannot judge the intelligence
because like any performer can see the

209
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,079
past media like through what type of question
a grandmaster configuration and based on

210
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,079
that data.

211
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,109
Yes, if that is, precisely what happens is
Loebner prize is a context which takes place

212
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:19,269
every year, and as I said this year it is
going to, the final is going to take place

213
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:20,980
on
September 14.

214
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,890
And, this one of the leading programs is called
Izar and this is a

215
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:32,810
pronunciation transcript from the earlier
competition rounds.

216
00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:34,970
So, you have seen it and
you can look at it again.

217
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:41,029
So, obviously, people who like such programs
look at the history just like students who

218
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:45,399
write exams they look at history of past questions,
even such people essentially.

219
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,401
So, that
is all allowed; everything is allowed.

220
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:51,170
Can you write a computer program which will
cool

221
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,019
the judge, if you want to use the term, to
thinking that the judge is talking to a human

222
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:56,019
being.

223
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,019
..

224
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:00,480
And, this was the conversation that we saw
this izar had.

225
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,829
And, he is making statements
like I am getting into, when he is talking

226
00:18:05,829 --> 00:18:08,169
about music he is making statements about,
the

227
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,700
last couple of lines you will see, I have
been getting into Hoomii, a type of Mongolian

228
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,069
throat singing.

229
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:15,710
What kind of music do you like?

230
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:19,900
So, obviously, such a program will have
to be equipped with general knowledge, atleast

231
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,250
which everybody knows essentially.

232
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,339
So, I
mean no human would be, would not knowing

233
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,339
it essentially.

234
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,230
So, you have to have that
kind of knowledge.

235
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,069
Of course, you also have to have some kind
of a rhetorical skills and ways of getting

236
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:42,980
around questions and things like that, all
that is part of it.

237
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,759
What if I were to give it to 12
digit numbers to multiply; say, what is the

238
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,359
product of 2 billion 29 million whatever,
some

239
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:59,809
12, 13 digit number I say, I give 2 12 digit
numbers and ask it what is the product of

240
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:04,569
that,
and the computer, poor thing, being a computer

241
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:09,599
gives me the answer before I even finish
the question, almost finish the question.

242
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,649
Would not I be able to say no, no, you are
not a

243
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,650
human being?

244
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:28,590
So, I will again leave it you to think about
this; is it a good test or bad

245
00:19:28,589 --> 00:19:29,589
test?

246
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:30,589
..

247
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:37,740
But, you have did mention Eliza, a program
written 1966 when computer has just come

248
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,529
into place by Weizenbaum.

249
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:43,899
And, it is a program for simple manipulation
of rules.

250
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,330
If you
take the input, do a little bit of twisting,

251
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:54,329
turn it round of it and put it back to the
user; and,

252
00:19:54,329 --> 00:20:01,000
to some people it is, one version of it called
Doctor, sounded like a psychotherapist.

253
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,930
And
they would start talking to the program as

254
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,150
if they were talking to a therapist.

255
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,800
And, this was a Russian scientist who was
visiting Stanford who actually went through

256
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,549
this conversation, and we saw that in the
last class.

257
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:20,000
And, what you see in purple is the
fact that how this program is manipulating

258
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,579
your input into generating its own output
essentially.

259
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,169
So, something like I am feeling a bit tired,
and it says why do you think you

260
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:33,430
are feeling a bit tired, is standard; and,
new questions like tell me about your family

261
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,200
and
so on.

262
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,519
Weizenbaum did not like the way people responded
to Eliza.

263
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:44,559
It is a very simple program.

264
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,589
It is nothing deep sophisticated about it,
but people used to interact with it as if

265
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,619
they were
interacting with somebody who understood the

266
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,609
complexities of their problems and thinks
like that essentially.

267
00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:59,159
So, he wrote this book “Computer Power and
Human Reason: From

268
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,370
Judgment to Calculation”.

269
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:05,049
He wanted say, in essence, that AI is not
possible; that you know computers can never

270
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:11,180
be
as deep thinkers as the therapist can be essentially.

271
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,549
So, there is a difference between what
can be, what appears to be, essentially.

272
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:21,710
And, human beings have a tendency, we have,
we

273
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,230
are willing to suspend our disbelief essentially.

274
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,079
They are willing to watch a James Bond

275
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:32,189
.movie and believe that all that is happening
is possible, and all kinds of things

276
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,210
essentially.

277
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,210
.

278
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:41,230
So, the fact that the man made artifact could
respond to human input easily leads humans

279
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:46,190
to make a leap of faith and conclude that
it responds intelligently and knowledgeably.

280
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,309
Throughout centuries we have been doing that
essentially.

281
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:58,299
So, in olden times, in Egypt,
people believed that statues which moved and

282
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,470
gestured had a sort of a soul, and they
could represent a god or a dead person and

283
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,009
communicate through a priest essentially.

284
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:12,220
So, I said older times Egypt, but even today
you can find in our country this sort of a

285
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,509
thing happening.

286
00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:18,369
You have people who will eat tea leaves, or
people who communicate

287
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:25,549
with your ancestors, or people who go and
get their fortunes foretold by a parrot who

288
00:22:25,549 --> 00:22:28,559
pulls a card out of a bunch of cards.

289
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,250
So, we do it all the time.

290
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,509
And. we believe, will not
everybody, we mostly believe that this is

291
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:35,539
possible essentially.

292
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,420
Such practices continued
to this day essentially.

293
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:48,880
And, in Europe, there was a great fascination
for such moving figures, moving automita,

294
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,760
or, you know, statues which could move around
shake their heads and so on.

295
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,660
So, Pamela
McCorduck writes in a book “Machines Who

296
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,700
Think” that in medieval times art of
making clocks decorated and animated figures

297
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
was very popular essentially.

298
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,319
So, if you
go to Germany, you can still find them.

299
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:12,509
For example, in clock towers when it is 12
noon

300
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:16,240
suddenly there is a lot of music and some
statues come out and do something and go

301
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,420
back in, that kind of stuff.

302
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:24,759
.So, it was popular in medieval times that
learned men kept robots essentially.

303
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,710
By learned
men, know, society was not very as galantive

304
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,220
as it was now; they were the kings, and
they were the peasants, and they were the

305
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,829
learned men, they were the traders and the
warriors.

306
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,589
So, there are classes of people, in those
learned men kept robots.

307
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:45,929
And, most interestingly to most people there
could be little difference between a human

308
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,310
figure that nodded, bowed, marched, or struck
a gong at a precise and predictable

309
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:53,159
moment which is entirely feasible.

310
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,360
You can construct machinery which is accurate,
and

311
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:04,419
we know that such machinery exist, so between
surf machinery and a human figure that

312
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,410
answered naughty questions and foretold the
future.

313
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,519
So, for us there is no difference.

314
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:12,599
If you can construct a statue which can nod
its head and

315
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:16,819
we ask the question and it nods its head,
we are willing to say that yes it understands

316
00:24:16,819 --> 00:24:21,740
what I am saying and it is telling my future,
and you know that sort of a thing.

317
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,279
So, in the study of history that we are going
to be doing, there going to be two strands

318
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,770
one is this mechanical side of talking statues,
moving statues, and things like that; and

319
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,710
other is going to be the philosophical side
which is about what is the notion of the mind,

320
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,309
how do the notion of the mind come.

321
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,990
You know, I am, so those questions we will
come

322
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,990
to little bit later.

323
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,839
Let us first address the mechanical side of
things essentially.

324
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:50,839
..

325
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,539
So, all this is happening in Europe.

326
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:59,259
We have this question of artificial people.

327
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:05,269
In Homer's
“Illiad” Hephaestus is supposed to have

328
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:09,920
created this Talos, a man of bronze which
would

329
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,789
patrol the beaches of Crete.

330
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:15,579
Hephaestus is also supposed to have created
Pandora; you

331
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:21,539
might have heard about Pandora who commissioned
by Zeus, Zeus was a god, to punish

332
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:24,579
mankind for accepting Prometheus‟s gift
of fire.

333
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:33,490
And, Pandora is supposed to take that
casket, but she is so curious about it that

334
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,640
she opens the casket essentially; you know,
and

335
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,020
let lose the evils into this world mostly.

336
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,789
Pygmalion, remember this one act show of Pygmalion
in which there was a character

337
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:51,200
called Eliza which was a name of the program
written by Weizenbaum.

338
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,700
Pygmalion was
also a mythical creature who was disappointed

339
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:03,269
by real women and created Galatea in
ivory, and Aphrodite who was another god.

340
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:08,009
So, the Greeks also had many gods like we
Indians have gods for doing different kinds

341
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:09,009
of thing.

342
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:11,720
Aphrodite obliges him by breathing
life into Galatea and apparently, he fell

343
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,339
in love with his own creation like in the
play.

344
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:23,419
Then Daedalus, you must have heard about,
more, well known for his artificial wings.

345
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:29,690
He was, he wanted to fly, but he was also
create, credited with creating lifelike statues

346
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,809
that wheezed and blinked, and scuttled about,
impressing everyone.

347
00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:36,059
So, this is the
important thing.

348
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,779
This statues which could seem to be autonomous;
and, if you are

349
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:42,759
autonomous you must be intelligent essentially.

350
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,730
So, that is the leaf of face that we are
making essentially.

351
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:54,690
Then, about a 1000 years ago, Pope Sylvester
is said to have made a statue with a talking

352
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,289
.head, with a limited vocabulary, and a penchant
for predicting the future.

353
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:01,970
So, that is why
people are willing to believe that this talking

354
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:08,450
head can tell your future; and on being
asking a query, it would reply yes or no by

355
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,360
shaking his head essentially, but all that
is in

356
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,649
myth, essentially.

357
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:15,360
There is some more mythology.

358
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,359
.

359
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,039
Paracelsus was a physician lived from 1493
to 1541 is supposed to have created a little

360
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:25,240
man called humunculus essentially.

361
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,038
And, he made this statement: “We shall be
like gods

362
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:35,450
... we shall duplicate God's greatest miracle
- the creation of man” essentially.

363
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:38,569
Because in
western thought we have been created in the

364
00:27:38,569 --> 00:27:48,480
image of god himself, and so, we can be
like him and create creatures in our own image.

365
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,170
So, he lived in Switzerland.

366
00:27:52,170 --> 00:28:01,490
And, Judah Loew ben Bezalel is reported to
have sculpted a human, a living man from

367
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,250
clay, and he called him Golem, to defend the
Jews of Prague.

368
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:14,299
So, in Jewish folklore, a
Golem is an animated anthropomorphic creature

369
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,519
made out of an inanimate matter.

370
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:17,730
So,
that is a kind of a image, the kind of creature

371
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:20,079
he supposed to have created essentially.

372
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,179
All
this material that is available in Wikipedia

373
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,639
and I have given all the references from where
I have taken the images.

374
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:27,638
..

375
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:30,889
So, let us talk about real mechanisms, or
some of them are mythical of course.

376
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,910
We
cannot imagine man made of clay which could

377
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,700
do all this sort of things.

378
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:43,830
But, in parallel,
real machinery was being created essentially.

379
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:50,059
Some of these ideas came from the east by
a Arabian countries.

380
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:59,159
And, in 802 Haroun-al-Rashid, you know, we
heard his name in other context as well, is

381
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,810
said to have presented Emperor Charlemagne
with an elaborate clock which sent out

382
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,259
dozens of cavaliers from a dozen windows each
and back again.

383
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:12,450
So, this is the kind of
clockwork which if you go to Eurpoe you can

384
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:18,341
still see now essentially in this, in the
town, or the city center we have this sort

385
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,899
of machinery still operating.

386
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,680
Then, a group of Arab astrologers is credited
with constructing what they called as a

387
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,670
thinking machine called the zairja which was
designed.

388
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:34,850
So, it was a collection of rotating
disc, you know, with markings on them.

389
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:41,240
And, if you rotate the disc according to some
input information you would compute something.

390
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:49,279
But, their notion was to generate ideas by
mechanical means with a help of a technique

391
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,480
of breaking down called al-jabr which, as
some of you know, is a route for the word

392
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,660
algebra.

393
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,370
And, by combining numbers values associated
with letters and categories, new

394
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,289
paths of insight and thought would be created
essentially.

395
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:11,779
So, this fascination of
autonomous entities, autonomous machines which

396
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:16,589
are thinking machines, goes back a
long time essentially.

397
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:24,879
.So, this zairja caught the imagination of
a Spanish Catalonian missionary called Ramon

398
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,490
Lull, and, who decided to design a Christian
version of it which he calls as Ars Magna.

399
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:38,470
And, he said the goal is to bring reason to
bear on all subjects, and in this way, arrive

400
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,990
at
the truth without the trouble of thinking

401
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,440
or fact finding.

402
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,110
So, one thing, when you look at
the quotations from these times you must remember

403
00:30:48,109 --> 00:30:51,679
that some of the meanings of the
words are a little bit different from what

404
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
they are know essentially.

405
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,509
So, those of you who have read Shakespeare
for example, would know that

406
00:30:56,509 --> 00:31:00,180
Shakespeare‟s English is a little bit different
from our's English, and our English, and we

407
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,080
need to understand things essentially.

408
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:06,869
But, this notion of arriving at truth without
the

409
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:15,079
trouble of thinking or fact finding, of course,
has been fulfilled now with programs like

410
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:22,579
google and so on; just have typing something
and you get answer obviously.

411
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,579
.

412
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:28,629
So, by the middle of the 14th century, large
clocks and figures became popular in many

413
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,601
areas of Germany and Italy.

414
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,330
And, talking brass heads became closely associated
with

415
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:37,309
learned man again.

416
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:43,090
The Archbishop of Salzburg built a working
model of a complete

417
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:49,379
miniature town, driven by water power essentially,
operated by water power from a

418
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,240
nearby stream.

419
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
..

420
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,809
So, 1 or 2 more examples.

421
00:31:56,809 --> 00:32:06,649
Vaucanson's Duck, Vacanson, keep, note the
years; this was,

422
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:13,350
he made this thing in around 1730 or something
like that, which is quite long time ago.

423
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:15,730
He was a French inventor.

424
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:18,910
So, one - he is credited with having made
an android which

425
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,080
could serve dinner and clear tables for the
visiting politicians.

426
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,429
However, one government
official declared that he thought Vaucanson's

427
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:30,830
tendencies as profane, and ordered his
workshop to be destroyed essentially.

428
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:39,210
We will see later that this kind of political
oversight has influenced europolian thought

429
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:45,220
quite a bit political and religious source;
for example, Copernicus and Galileo and all

430
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,509
these people was sort of worried about putting
forward their ideas, about what the world

431
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,879
is really like.

432
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,460
So, he created this, his most famous creation
is this duck called the

433
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,549
mechanical duck which could appear to be drinking,
eating, quacking, splashing about in

434
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:10,359
water, and digesting its food; became very
famous, 1739.

435
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:18,779
And, there is a image of a replica of this
duck which is lying in some museum

436
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:19,779
somewhere.

437
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:26,080
Though, of course, in real life, meaning in
the actual duck that he created, it

438
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,669
did not have digestive abilities.

439
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,090
The food was actually collected in, the food
that the duck

440
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:38,829
was supposed to be eating was collected in
one container, and the output was sort of

441
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:41,809
prestored and sent out from another container.

442
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:47,619
But, he was hopeful that a truly digesting
automaton could one day be designed.

443
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:51,089
So, this fascination with machinery is that
you are

444
00:33:51,089 --> 00:33:54,189
trying to look at essentially.

445
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,190
..

446
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,980
Another very famous example is this chess
playing Turk by Kempelen.

447
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:06,730
Wolfgang
Kempelen, 1734 -1804, he created chess playing

448
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:14,230
machine known as a Mechanical Turk
constructed in 1770 to impress the Empress

449
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,940
Maria Theresa of Austria.

450
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,429
And, the
mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong

451
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:23,119
game of chess against human opponents,
as well as perform the knight's tour.

452
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,329
So, you must be familiar with the knight‟s
tour on

453
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:33,429
the 64 board chess square, can you move a
knight to cover all the squares exactly ones.

454
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:40,829
And, the figure on the bottom is knights to
a apparently created by the Mechanical Turk,

455
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:43,230
looks quite a aesthetic figure to make.

456
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,789
Actually, you might have written a program
to

457
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,038
create a knight‟s tour of some point.

458
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:54,019
Now, this was the automaton which Kempelen
took

459
00:34:54,018 --> 00:35:02,149
all over Europe; he impressed Napoleon and
other people, beating his general Hectaus.

460
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:08,960
And, here is the picture of the automaton.

461
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,389
You can see it; maybe I should make it a bit
larger.

462
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:22,018
If you look carefully, you can see that inside
this box was a human chess player

463
00:35:22,018 --> 00:35:23,018
sitting this.

464
00:35:23,018 --> 00:35:24,018
So, it was a really a Hokes.

465
00:35:24,018 --> 00:35:27,568
Since, it was not discovered for a long time
essentially.

466
00:35:27,568 --> 00:35:34,170
And it travelled for nearly 84 years, Europe
and America, beating all kinds of

467
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,880
luminaries at chess.

468
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,769
It seems, Edgar Allan Pope wrote an essay
trying to expose that this chess play cannot

469
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:46,969
be
a real machine.

470
00:35:46,969 --> 00:35:53,379
So, let us move on to more useful things.

471
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,240
Mechanical arithmetic; can we
make machines which will do arithmetic for

472
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,239
us?

473
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:01,068
So, Pascal, of course, you are familiar
with.

474
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:08,920
As students of science in various places Pascal‟s
name is appeared; not least as the

475
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,150
programming language, name of a programming
language.

476
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,588
.So, he invented a mechanical calculator using
something called Lanthonyer which we

477
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:17,788
will not go into.

478
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:22,980
And, he tried out 50 different prototypes
before presenting his machine

479
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,329
in 1645 with a public.

480
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:29,240
It was called Pascalin or reflecting machines
or Pascal's calculator.

481
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,929
And, you could add and subtract 2 numbers;
that was its limits of its mental abilities,

482
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:39,409
and
multiply and divide by repetition essentially.

483
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:46,118
There is a image of Pascaline from one of
the museums.

484
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:53,630
And, he received the rights to
produce this machine and sell it in France,

485
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:58,108
but it was not something which was
commercially viable for him.

486
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:01,679
So, as this article says, the cost and complexity
of

487
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,809
producing the Pascaline was too much for him;
and the production ceased in a year.

488
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,130
This
is a real machine which could add, subtract,

489
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,059
and multiply, 2 numbers.

490
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:19,460
So, you can see,
we are already looking at advent of calculating

491
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,460
machines.

492
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,460
.

493
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,650
So, all these are famous names.

494
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,920
You must have encountered them.

495
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,759
For example, Leibniz
we know as an inventor of the calculus.

496
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:33,599
So, these are sort of multifaceted people
with all

497
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,519
kinds of things in those days.

498
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,469
So, he was a German philosopher and a mathematician.

499
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,730
He
started to work on his own calculator after

500
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:43,838
Pascal's death.

501
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,858
So, he invented something
which is called as a Leibniz wheel or a stepped

502
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:53,268
drum which could do counting in some
sense.

503
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:56,389
So, here is the image from the Wikipedia site.

504
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:02,348
So, you can see there is a gear in the red
color fixed to a rod.

505
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:06,760
And, depending upon; and there is a step set
of teeth in the orange

506
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,760
cylinder.

507
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:15,680
So, depending upon where the gear is it would
be rotated some number of times

508
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:19,409
.dependent upon howmany of those teeth is
encountered essentially.

509
00:38:19,409 --> 00:38:24,039
So, when it was on
the lower part it would count 0 or 1, if it

510
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:28,108
was raised to the extreme right then it would
be

511
00:38:28,108 --> 00:38:31,449
struck by let us say 9 or 10 teeth and it
would count of 10.

512
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:35,149
So, it is just a small counting
device that he invented.

513
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:38,680
All these machines in those times were mechanical
in nature.

514
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:41,179
It is called as stepped
drum.

515
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:46,879
And, as you can see from this quote it was
used for 3 centuries until the advent of

516
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:54,880
the electronic calculator which came only
much later in life, in fact, in the last century.

517
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,999
And, he build this machine called the stepped
reckoner.

518
00:38:57,998 --> 00:39:01,289
So, the stepped reckoner, the
stepped name comes from the kind of drumit

519
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,420
uses, the step drum.

520
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:09,490
It was a digital mechanical calculator invented
by Leibniz around 1672 and completed in

521
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:10,539
1694.

522
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:15,599
It could perform multiplication by repeated
addition, and division by repeated

523
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,599
subtraction.

524
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,829
And, it could operate with 8 digit numbers.

525
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:22,710
So, if you multiply 2, 8 digit
numbers it would give you 16 digit answer.

526
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:32,429
So, that was its precision; and image of the
stepped reckoner from one of the museums essentially.

527
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:33,429
..

528
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:40,039
Leibniz, of course, was as I said, multifaceted
person.

529
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,750
He believed that much of human
listening could be reduced to calculations

530
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,829
of a sort.

531
00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:50,369
We are moving towards AI in some
sense; that can we have machines automaton

532
00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:58,050
which think and it can do reasoning, and
you know, including things like arithmetic.

533
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,568
But, he is going behind arithmetic.

534
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,730
He is
saying that human visioning could be reduced

535
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:06,248
to calculation of a sort and such
calculations could resolve many differences

536
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:07,248
of opinion essentially.

537
00:40:07,248 --> 00:40:09,858
So, here is a quote from Leibniz.

538
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:13,288
He says, “the only way to rectify our reasonings,
and

539
00:40:13,289 --> 00:40:18,010
mind this language is not modern language,
it is slightly old language, the only way

540
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,950
to
rectify our reasonings is to make them as

541
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:22,789
tangible as those of the Mathematicians, so
that

542
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:30,639
we can find our error at a glance, and when
there is a dispute among people, persons,

543
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:35,569
we
can simply say; Let us calculate without further

544
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:39,630
ado, to see who is right”.

545
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,900
The motivation behind devising logic is the
same essentially.

546
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,730
And, we will see that logic
also evolved from similar background.

547
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:54,829
But, this idea that arguments can be settled
by

548
00:40:54,829 --> 00:41:00,650
calculation, so you do not have to fight or
something like that, also goes back to those

549
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:03,818
time.

550
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:06,170
Of course, if we tell this to the UP government
they would not believe it

551
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,230
essentially.

552
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:19,750
So, these are the general principles of his
logic, and, in fact, his whole

553
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,750
philosophy.

554
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:26,880
And, they are, that all our ideas are compounded
from a very small number of simple

555
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,700
ideas which form the alphabet of human thought
essentially, very significant step is

556
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,068
making essentially.

557
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:40,509
He says that everything that we think about
is essentially

558
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:45,568
.combinations of some small set of simple
things.

559
00:41:45,568 --> 00:41:52,971
Remember, in those days, physics or
science had still not discovered the notion

560
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:54,440
of an atom.

561
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,530
All those ideas came much later
essentially.

562
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,400
And, Leibniz is talking about the fact that
there are small number of simple ideas which

563
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,460
combine and form complex ideas to form new
ideas essentially.

564
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:11,039
And, this is an idea
which, sort of, carries forward to present

565
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,940
that knowledge representation as well.

566
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,838
They
have been approaches to knowledge representation

567
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,750
which says that we will work with
small number primitive concepts and derive

568
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,769
all other concepts from those concepts
essentially.

569
00:42:25,769 --> 00:42:28,248
So, it is a very significant idea.

570
00:42:28,248 --> 00:42:31,669
So, the alphabet of human thought.

571
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:39,700
And secondly, complex ideas proceed from these
simple ideas by a uniform and

572
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:43,500
symmetrical combination, analogous to arithmetical
multiplication.

573
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,748
So, what you mean
by uniform and symmetrical combination?

574
00:42:46,748 --> 00:42:52,078
Is that there is a well defined way of doing
things essentially, well defined mechanical

575
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,180
way of just like you have algorithms for
adding or doing long division or multiplication,

576
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:04,268
you have a algorithms for combining
smaller ideas into more complex one.

577
00:43:04,268 --> 00:43:09,639
So, there are two things he is saying - one
is that everything, all ideas are made up

578
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,509
of first
finite set of simple ideas, and then there

579
00:43:13,509 --> 00:43:18,309
is a uniform way of combining ideas to form
more complex ideas.

580
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:23,979
Then remember this was in the 17th century.

581
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:24,978
..

582
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:30,159
The first commercial success of a mechanical
calculator was in 1820.

583
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:42,778
Thomas de Colmar
from France, he built this machine and it

584
00:43:42,778 --> 00:43:51,429
was strong and steady enough to extend daily
use in the office environment essentially.

585
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:58,248
So, if you look at the last paragraph, so
these

586
00:43:58,248 --> 00:44:01,848
are some of the images which are of those
real machines.

587
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:05,528
And, as you can see the second
paragraph they were manufactured from 1851

588
00:44:05,528 --> 00:44:07,099
to 1915.

589
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:11,160
So, not even 100 years ago you
might have found people using such a machine

590
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:15,920
to do arithmetic essentially.

591
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,000
The last idea says that its sturdy design
made it a key player in the move from human

592
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,530
computers to calculating machines that took
place during the second half of the 19th

593
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,530
century.

594
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:29,680
So, I want to draw your attention to the phrase
human computers.

595
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,259
Before our
computers, digital computers, or mechanical

596
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:38,599
computers that we will see in the moment
were invented, but the word computation was

597
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:40,088
essentially applied to human beings.

598
00:44:40,088 --> 00:44:42,500
The
human beings computed things and they were

599
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:50,139
called computers essentially; and this is
the term that you will see again later sometime.

600
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:51,139
..

601
00:44:51,139 --> 00:44:54,710
That brings us to the first computer, so,
you all familiar with Charles Babbage I presume;

602
00:44:54,710 --> 00:45:01,809
18th century; he was a mathematician, philosopher,
inventor, mechanical engineer; best

603
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:05,528
remembered for his idea of the programmable
computer.

604
00:45:05,528 --> 00:45:09,338
All the machines that we have
seen so far were not programmable; they could

605
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:12,500
do arithmetic for example, and that was
about it essentially.

606
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,469
Charles Babbage took this to the next step.

607
00:45:15,469 --> 00:45:21,818
So, he as a child was fascinated by the same
automaton, the kind of talking heads, moving

608
00:45:21,818 --> 00:45:23,608
figures that we talked about.

609
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:28,639
And he, this is
a quote from what he said about some statues

610
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:31,618
that he saw displayed by a man called
Merlin.

611
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:37,318
And, he described them as saying, there is
2 feminine figures, he says, one walked, used

612
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:42,670
an eye-glass occasionally, and bowed frequently;
her motions were singularly graceful.

613
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,950
And he says, the other was a dancer, full
of imagination, I do not know how he got that,

614
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:50,669
and irresistible essentially.

615
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:55,730
So, this was the general fascination with
talking, moving

616
00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:00,170
figures that, you know, was pushing all these
ideas forward essentially.

617
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:05,970
So, in 1822 he began a building what is called
as a difference engine; you must have

618
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,789
heard the term.

619
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:11,818
It was designed to compute polynomial functions,
more than addition and

620
00:46:11,818 --> 00:46:17,259
multiplication.

621
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:23,998
The first engine was composed of 25,000 parts
weighed about 13,600 kilo

622
00:46:23,998 --> 00:46:27,199
grams, and was 8 feet tall.

623
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:28,199
...

624
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:30,539
Here is an image of a difference engine.

625
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,449
On the bottom we can see.

626
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:35,268
On the bottom left
you can see an image which is there in London

627
00:46:35,268 --> 00:46:36,539
science museum.

628
00:46:36,539 --> 00:46:39,929
And, on its right is a
small enlargement of the gear system that

629
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,219
it was using.

630
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:46,149
And, on the top is a part of a
difference engine assembled after his death

631
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:50,499
by his son, using parts found in his lab
essentially.

632
00:46:50,498 --> 00:46:55,959
That is a original Babbage engine, whereas
what here is a recreation, modern

633
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:58,510
recreation of the difference engine that you
can see.

634
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,460
So, these are working machines.

635
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
..

636
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:10,778
One place where Babbage got some ideas was
from the so called Jaquard Looms

637
00:47:10,778 --> 00:47:11,778
essentially.

638
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:15,599
So, why the computer are different machine
from the rest of the machines,

639
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,640
because it is programmable; and how was it
programmable, because we have this idea of

640
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:21,639
a stored program.

641
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:26,838
We can plug in a program and learn that program,
then we can plug in

642
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:29,009
a different program and learn the different
program.

643
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,940
So, the stored program which can be
input.

644
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:38,889
The idea came from this Jaquard Looms which
was, which is the kind of punched cards

645
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:44,871
that you see here on the left which is an
enlargement of the figure on right which were

646
00:47:44,871 --> 00:47:46,680
used to create designs in fabric essentially.

647
00:47:46,679 --> 00:47:50,219
This looms were create to, used to create
this

648
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:54,268
pattern fabrics; and the pattern could be
conclude by this punched cards.

649
00:47:54,268 --> 00:48:01,588
So, this idea of
punched cards is what Babbage took from there.

650
00:48:01,588 --> 00:48:02,588
..

651
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,588
.
And he created what is known as the analytic

652
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:07,759
engine.

653
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:12,519
It was a proposed, he did not
actually build it, mechanical general purpose

654
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:19,278
computer designed by Charles Babbage,
first describe in 1837.

655
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:22,780
It had an arithmetical logic unit control
flow, all modern terms in

656
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,710
computer science in the form of conditional
and branching loops and integrated memory.

657
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,900
And, it was the first machine which in the
modern sense could be said to be Turingcomplete

658
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:39,329
which means it is equivalent to a Turing machine.

659
00:48:39,329 --> 00:48:40,329
..

660
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:48,579
The first programmer was his accomplice, a
collaborator, Augusta Ada King.

661
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:53,640
She was a
daughter of Lord Byron who was a poet.

662
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,768
She is now known as Ada Lovelace, was
English mathematician and writer, chiefly

663
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:02,719
known for the work that she did along with
Babbage.

664
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:11,189
So, her notes include what can be called as
a first algorithm which is processed

665
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:15,940
by a machine, and because of this she is often
called as the first programmer.

666
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:18,588
And, the
programming language ADA that you might have

667
00:49:18,588 --> 00:49:26,288
heard about, promoted by the US
department of defense, is named after her.

668
00:49:26,289 --> 00:49:27,289
..

669
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:30,059
So, she went beyond number crunching.

670
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:35,140
Again, like (49:20) she realized the potential
of

671
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,719
the device extended far more beyond number
crunching.

672
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,689
And, she wrote, and this is the
quotation, that the analytical might act upon

673
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:48,588
other things besides number, were objects
found whose mutual fundamental relations could

674
00:49:48,588 --> 00:49:55,358
be expressed by those of the abstract
science of operations, and so on.

675
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,449
And then in particular she talks about generating
music.

676
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:04,278
She says, that supposing that
fundamental relations of pitched sounds and

677
00:50:04,278 --> 00:50:08,068
the science of harmony and musical
composition were susceptible of such expressions,

678
00:50:08,068 --> 00:50:12,960
the engine might compose elaborate
and scientific pieces of music of any degree

679
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,280
of complexity essentially.

680
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:20,030
So, even then Babbage was just designing this
analytical engine which is not even built,

681
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:23,730
and she was imagining that such a machine
would compose music essentially; because

682
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,798
now days we know, it can be done.

683
00:50:27,798 --> 00:50:28,798
..

684
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:36,880
And finally, in this study of mechanical history
we look at this first electronic machine

685
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,509
which was built called ENIAC.

686
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:39,728
You must be familiar with it.

687
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:43,598
And, you can just see the
size of ENIAC – 17,000 vacuum tubes, 7,

688
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,030
200 crystal diodes, and so on and so forth.

689
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:51,450
27
tons, it occupied a full room essentially.

690
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:56,719
It was not even as powerful as a small computer
that you have on a smart phone nowadays.

691
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,679
But, that was the first electronic machine
essentially.

692
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:00,679
..

693
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:06,858
So, with that we come to the end of the first
part which is the mechanical side of this

694
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:07,858
thing.

695
00:51:07,858 --> 00:51:13,199
So, will take a small break and come back
with the second question which is the

696
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,939
motion of mind and philosophy; how do the
motion of mind come back in philosophy.

697
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:42,450
So, we will stop for a while and then we will
start in about 3 or 4 minutes essentially.

698
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:52,449
.
