there are other sentiment tasks than

just simple positive or negative

polarity one important one has to do

with finding the sentiment of a of an

individual sentence which we're going to

want to do for finding aspects or

attributes that we talked about earlier

so that's the finding the target of the

sentiment what it is that we're talking

about the sentiment about so here's a

sentence the food was great but the

service was awful this whole sentence

doesn't really have a sentiment it has a

positive sentiment about food and a

negative sentence sentiment about

service so we'd like to be able to deal

with this kind of micro sentiment where

we haven't we have a sentiment about one

attribute and a different sentiment

about a different attribute or aspect so

how are we going to find the aspect or

attribute or sometimes it's called

target of a sentiment and I'll show you

an example that a way of doing things

that was developed both by who and and

the oh and by Blair goldenson at all and

the idea is we first look through all

the reviews and we find every highly

frequent phrase so let's say that the

word fish tacos occurs a lot in in in

this particular restaurant reviews of

this restaurant and then we mark down we

have filters that say um we prefer

highly frequent places if they occur

right after a sentiment word so maybe

we've very often see the phrase great

followed by fish tacos or terrible

followed by fish tacos that suggests

that fish tacos is the is an aspect a

likely aspect of a let's say a taqueria

so if we see great food a lot we see

food occurring very often in a review

and we see the word grade and terrible

and awful before it a lot we know it's

probably an aspect that people are

applying sentiment for and this can be

used automatically to find sentiment for

lots of things

so Blair Goldman at all used it for

example for casino reviews of casinos to

find words like casino buffet pool

resort and beds are the kind of things

people comment about in reviews on

casinos for a barber you might

talk about the experience or how good a

job it was or facts about the haircut

for a department store you might talk

about sales or or different departments

or the selection of the store things

like that so we can automatically find

the aspect in other cases though the

word that describes the aspect may not

be in the sentence and so um for some

sentiment topics like restaurants or

hotels it's pretty well understood what

the aspects are that people care about

for restaurants restaurants they tend to

care about food decor service value and

so for cases where we know in advance

what the frequent aspects are here we

can take a small corpus of restaurant

reviews and we can hand label it with

this mark every sentence um does this

sentence talk about the food does it

talk about the decor or is it none of

the above and then we can just build a

classifier which given the sentence

assigns an aspect to the sentence is

this sentence about food is this

sentence about decor sentence about

service and so on and it could be a

sentence or we could assign that with

you know with phrases or maybe with

clauses with pieces of sentences

whichever we'd like to do so two ways of

finding aspect of a sentiment we can

automatically find frequent phrases so

we can find phrases and then we can

build up a set of phrases that occur

frequently and decide those are good

phrases to write to that we'd like to

know about for this particular product

or we can decide the aspects in advance

aspects are come in advance like we know

what they are for restaurants and then

our job is just a little classifier to

find them in the review so we can decide

if what person said about the food was

positive or negative so putting this all

together this is the Blair goldenson

algorithm from Google we have a set of

reviews we're going to extract a bunch

of sentences or phrases so here's our

extracted sentences or phrases and now

for each one of them we're going to run

our set

and classifier is this phrase positive

negative or maybe it's neutral okay and

then for the ones that are that have

sentiment in them the ones that are

positive or negative so in the center we

have sentiments and phrases with

sentiment plus minus minus plus plus

minus and so on we're gonna extract the

aspects of these so is this about food

is it about is it about decor what's the

sentence about so now we have plus food

and now we have minus decor minus

service and so on for each sentence or

phrase we have both a sentiment and an

aspect and now we aggregate these

together and produce a final summary and

here's an example of what you might get

um as the final summary so maybe for a

hotel four rooms we might get that this

sentence the room was clean and

everything worked fine positive

sentiment another positive sentiment

here's an example of negative sentiment

so we first figure out that worst is a

negative sentiment and then we might

extract from somewhere in here that

there's some mention of rooms and

similarly for a service we might see the

service gives new meaning to slow and

that's negative

we made some simplifications in the

baseline method we as we gave for

sentiment classification we assumed that

the class is positive and negative

occurred with equal frequency and that's

of course not usually true in the real

world and it turns out that when the

classes are not balanced we can't use

accuracies as an evaluation and the F

score can deal well in when evaluating

classes where there's many more positive

than negative or maybe there's many more

negative than positive reviews it turns

out that this if the if there's a severe

imbalance in class frequencies that can

actually degrade the classifier

performance and there are two standard

things we do to deal with that one is we

just resample before we train so for

example if one class has a million

reviews and one class has 10,000 reviews

they

and we might just dance down sample and

take only um 10 to the 4th of these

reviews to match with these reviews

instead of resampling we can use

cost-sensitive learning cost-sensitive

learning we take we actually change the

classifier and we tell the classifier

don't even though this one you've seen a

lot more of this frequent thing penalize

it for misclassifying the really rare

thing and so that'll force it to focus a

little more on their way of things

than on the very frequent thing so two

things you can do to deal with the

imbalanced frequency problem that often

occurs in real classes we also in our in

our basal base line algorithm made the

simplifying assumption that sentiment

was a binary problem positive or

negative so how do we deal with five

stars or seven stars or ten stars so

there's two ways we can do this we can

map onto a binary class we can say

things that are more than three point

five stars are positive or less than

three point five or negative or we can

take the average of all the data we can

z-score we can do various ways of

drawing a boundary between positive

things and negative things or we can

actually attack the seven one two seven

classification tasks directly by using

linear or ordinal regression or

specialize models like metric labeling

that's used by panin Lee so again we can

either down sample and just do binary

classification or we can use a more

advanced method of classification that

lets us predict an ordinal value or or a

real-valued number so in summary

sentiment generally modeled as a

classification task polarity often with

binary them less often and with some

kind of ordinal or linear valued label

and um negation a very important feature

to use for lots of tasks using all the

words in naive Bayes seems to work well

off for other tasks using subsets of

words may help and we can either use

handbell polarity lexicons or for tasks

for which the pluriel ex-cons seem

inappropriate we can induce lexicons

using semi-supervised learning

some hand-built seeds now remember that

sentiment is really just one of many

kinds of effective state it's a it's a

kind of attitude classification but

there's lots of other kinds of affective

state classification that come up in

their computational problems that are

very similar to sentiment analysis so to

look at some of them for emotions we

might want to detect annoyed callers to

some dialogue system so it's detecting

the emotion of annoyance or detect

confused or frustrated students in

online tutorial versus confident

students for longer - removes we might

want to find traumatized or depressed

people like writers of some blog or text

in conversations we might want to detect

if someone's friendly or unfriendly in

very long term personality traits we

might want to detect extroverts or

introverts for building dialogue systems

that can communicate better with

extroverts are in traversed and there's

lots of research actually on all of

these tasks we'll just show you one of

them which is a task we've worked on

here at Stanford which is detection of

friendliness so um

friendly speakers use it turns out use

collaborative conversational style so we

build classifiers that look at features

like how often someone laughs or how

often they use negative emotional words

or how frequently they use phrases like

that's too bad that indicates sympathy

or agreement I think so - so the more

friendly someone is the more likely they

are used sympathetic words or agreement

or the less likely they already use a

hedge like kind of or sort of and we've

shown that these classifiers help in

we've looked at the task of detecting

how friendly someone is or how

flirtatious someone is in speed dates

and we found that these kind of features

help in detecting friendliness so simple

lexical features like words and phrases

and where we have speech speech features

like prosody or pitch all of these can

help in detecting sentiment simple

polarity and much more rich affective

meaning of all sorts of kinds
