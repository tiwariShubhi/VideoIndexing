perhaps the simplest way of doing

relation extraction is using hand-built

patterns let's look at the intuition

here's a sentence agar is a substance

prepared from a mixture of red algae

such as gel idiom for laboratory or

industrial use perhaps you like me and I

didn't know what the word Jewel idiom

meant but I can learn what it means from

this sentence and the way we know is

that we see this phrase red algae such

as gel idiom so that tells us that gel

idiom is a kind of red algae and this

intuition from an early paper by Marti

Hearst suggested that there's in fact a

lot of patterns that can be used to

suggest that two entities are in this is

ax or hyponym relation so for example I

knowing if I saw red algae such as

gelatin that tells us that gel idiom is

a kind of red algae so X is a kind of Y

I might see other patterns them like

Jalili 'm or other red algae or Jalili

'm and other red algae or red algae

including Jahlil 'i'm in each case I

have textual pattern holding between two

entities that's a strong cue that what I

have here is a particular relation

between the two entities an hour--the

showed that these kind of patterns were

able to learn the is a relation between

new terms such as Bambara and dong and

Boulud or learning about author names or

learning country names and so on that

could be added to a database now the

same kind of intuition about using

handwritten rules to learn relations can

be used for the richer relations that

we've been looking at richer than than

just is ax or hyponym and the intuition

for learning these more richer rules is

that these relations often hold between

specific entities

so the location located in relation

often holds between an organization and

a location or the founded relation holds

between a person and an organization so

in addition to just coming up with

clever string patterns that might

indicate a relation we can also use

facts about the actual entities that are

involved and that will help us learn

which

kind of relations we might have in other

words we're gonna start with the

identity tags and that's going to help

us do relation extraction

now many of these aren't quite enough

and to see this let's look at a couple

of examples imagine I have an entity

drug and an entity disease what kind of

relations can hold between those

entities well a lot we can the drug

could cure a disease it could prevent a

disease it could even cause a disease

and that's true for any kinds of

entities between a person and an

organization the person could be the

founder of the organization that could

be an investor in the organization a

member of the organization an employee

of the organization they could be the

president of the organization so any

kind of relation may hold between these

entities although there are constraints

so the person can't cure can't be the

Cure or the disease caused or other

kinds of things though so there are

constraints from the named entities but

lots of other relations meet those

constraints and so we're going to

combine these two intuitions using a

pattern and using the named entities so

we can combine these two intuitions the

use of a named entity and use of

specific patterns to extract richer

relations consider the question who

holds what office in what organization

so we'd like to extract from a sentence

like George Marshall secretary of state

of the United States that a person

George Marshall played the role or had

the had the office of secretary of state

in an organization in the United States

government and so we have an entity

person an entity position and an to the

organization and here's a pattern person

comma position of organization that

might extract from a sentence like this

the position of relation between a

person and an organization and we might

need to have another pattern for

sentences of a different form so here we

have person I'm Truman appointed

Marshall secretary of state so we might

have person appointed or some other

words like named or chose and so on

person position and we might have an

optional preposition in between so

Truman appointed Marshall as Secretary

of State would be an option there or

just Truman appointed Marshall Secretary

of State so again a combination of our

patterns with maybe list of possible

words we might get from a thesaurus or

some kind of thing and the named

entities of the of the entities or

finally another pattern George Marshall

was named US Secretary of State

so again person may be a form of the

verb to be and optionally followed by

again one of these named or appointed

words and there may be an optional

preposition and then the organization

and the position so by combining the

named entity types with the words or

perhaps parts of speech in between we

can create patterns that extract

particular relations now an advantage of

the pattern extraction algorithm for

doing a relation extraction is that

these human patterns tend to be high

precision if you look at a particular

domain and you write rules and the rules

are usually pretty high precision and

they can be tailored to these very

specific domains if you have a

particular relation extraction task when

you write rules that can they can get

this high precision the minuses are the

human patterns tend to be low recall

often you don't think of a particular

way somebody might have thought to word

a certain sentence in free text that

expresses a relation and it's also a lot

of work to do this especially if you

have a lot of relations you're going to

have to come up with very specific

patterns for each relation and for each

domain in this relation and I'd be nice

to also get a higher accuracy than you

can get from these relations

so while handbill patterns are useful

method for relation extraction we're

going to look at other methods like

supervised and unsupervised methods as

well so handwritten rules with named

entity patterns and other kinds of words

and parts of speech in between are a

good way to extract relations they have

some problems of accuracy and of

generalizing to new domains and so we're

going to also introduced other methods

of doing a relation extraction like

supervised and unsupervised learning
