in this lecture we'll introduce the

topic of text classification and the

naive Bayes algorithm which is one of

the most important ways of doing text

classification let's begin by looking at

some examples of text classification

applications here I've shown an email

that actually received the other day how

do I know that this email is spam take a

look at the mail and think of some

features you might automatically extract

from this email that tells you that it's

spam you might notice the word great

miss a misspelling of great so we have a

typo here maybe you might notice

important notice and maybe an

exclamation point it's pretty rare that

universities put exclamation points in

their subject headers you might notice

that there's no m dan here no it's not

addressed to me in particular in it we

have undisclosed recipients and there's

no particular address and the URL is a

little funny here that's not a Stanford

URL maybe the word exciting each of

these features can be combined in a

classifier to give us some evidence that

we've got a piece of spam another

important text classification task is

authorship attribution how do I know

which author wrote which piece of text

one of the most famous examples of

authorship attribution is the famous

anonymous essays called the Federalist

Papers that were written at the

beginning of the history of our country

in part to convince the state of New

York to ratify the early Constitution

and three authors wrote various numbers

of the letters but twelve of the letters

it wasn't clear which author wrote and

in 1963 the and in 1963 Mosteller and

Wallace showed that Bayesian methods

were able to distinguish which letters

were written by Madison and which

letters were written by Hamilton and the

Bayesian methods that they use in 1963

gave rise to the naive Bayes method that

we're going to

talking about today another text

classification task is gender

identification determining if an author

is male or female recent research in

gender identification has shown that we

can look at the number of pronouns and

other features the number of determiners

the number of noun phrases are subtly

indicative of the difference between

male and female writers female writers

tend to use more pronouns and male

writers tend to use more facts and

determiners in their noun phrases and

you can see from that that here we have

a lot of pronouns and here we have a lot

of determiners and unfactual sentences

with with the copula verbs and so you

might determine that this is in fact a

male and this is a female and that would

be correct this is the author Margaret

drabble and this is the author Anthony

grade another text classification task

is sentiment analysis and one of the

classic sentiment analysis tasks is

movie review identification given a

review whether it's a movie or a product

can I tell whether this review is

positive or negative and although I'm

going to show you an example here from

movies this could apply to any product

review for any any product or service

that you might find on the web this is

actually a very important commercial

application so suppose we saw review

that said unbelievably disappointing

well that's clearly a negative review

how about full of zany characters and

originally applied satire positive how

about this is the greatest screwball

comedy ever filmed we've got words like

greatest or greatest ever um that's very

positive how about it was pathetic the

worst part about it was the boxing

scenes here we've got evidence like

pathetic and worst and so on to tell us

this is in fact a negative review

text classification often we also apply

text classification to scientific

articles for example deciding what the

topic of a particular article in a

database like MEDLINE might be for

example we might have to decide in

automatically indexing an article which

of various subjects antagonist or blood

supply or drug therapy or epidemiology

apply to any particular article that's

written that's in our database so in

summary text classification is the task

of assigning any kind of topic category

to any piece of text and that could be

subject categories you know you know in

some kind of an online database it can

be detecting spam it can be choosing an

author from a set of authors choosing

their gender or maybe it's their age you

want to find the young writers or old

writers telling if a language Distronic

if a text was written in one language

versus another language and the

important commercial application of

sentiment analysis all of these are

examples of text classification let's

define the task of text classification

we have as input a document D and then a

fixed set of classes the set C with J

classes c1 c2 up till CJ and our goal

given this document and the set of

classes is to predict a class C from

that set of classes so our job is to

take a document and assign a class to

that document how do we do this the

simplest possible text classification

method is to use handwritten rules so

for example if we're doing spam

detection we might just have a list of

bad email addresses a blacklist that

these people are probably spammers or we

might look for phrases like millions of

dollars or you have been selected these

are good indications that we have spam

and if these rules are carefully refined

by an expert you can get high accuracy

from handwritten the rules but in

general building and maintaining these

rules is expensive so

hand-coded rules are often used as part

of a system of text classification we we

generally combine that with an important

method from machine learning this method

is supervised machine learning so in

supervised machine learning we have a

document D just as we did before and a

fixed set of classes as we did before

but we need one more thing now we need a

training set of some late some documents

that have been hand labeled for their

class so we have for document one we

know that it's in class one for document

two it's in some other class and maybe

for document and we have a label for the

class of document M so given the

document the set of classes and the

fixed and the training set of hand label

documents the goal of machine learning

is to produce a classifier and we'll use

gamma to refer to the classifier and

gamma is a function that given a new

document will give us the class so given

a set of training labels of documents

and classes we'll learn a classifier

that map's a document to a class there's

lots of kinds of machine learning

classifiers we're going to talk today

about naive Bayes but we'll see we'll

look later in the course we'll talk

about logistic regression and we'll

touch on other kinds of classifiers like

support vector machines also called

SVM's K nearest neighbors lots of other

classifiers no matter which classifier

we use the task of text classification

is to take a document it's text other

kinds of features and extract features

that represent the document and build a

classifier that can tell us which class

the document belongs to
