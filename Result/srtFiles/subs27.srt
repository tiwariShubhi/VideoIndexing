
1
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.040
Next we will talk about Spark streaming.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.474
After this video you will be able to
summarize how Spark reads streaming data,

3
00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:17.240
list several sources of streaming
data supported by Spark, and

4
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.077
describe Spark's sliding windows.

5
00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:25.778
Spark streaming provides
scalable processing for

6
00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:30.954
real-time data and
runs on top of Spark Core.

7
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:36.319
Continuous data streams are converted or

8
00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:42.130
grouped into discrete RDDs which
can then be processed in parallel.

9
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.357
Spark Streaming provides APIs for Scala,

10
00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:51.620
Java, and Python,
like other Spark products.

11
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.820
Spark Streaming can read
data from many different

12
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.278
types of resources,
including Kafka and Flume.

13
00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:12.778
Kafka is a high throughput published
subscribed messaging system,

14
00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:17.044
and Flume collects and
aggregates log data.

15
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:22.125
Spark Streaming can also read from batch

16
00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:26.609
input data sources, such as HDFS,

17
00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.720
S3, and many other non SQL databases.

18
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.368
Additionally, Spark Streaming can read
directly from Twitter, raw TCP sockets,

19
00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:45.306
and many other data sources that
are real-time data providers.

20
00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:49.280
So how does it all work?

21
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.910
Here we show you a flow of
transformations and actions

22
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.131
which you will try in the upcoming reading
and hands-on exercises on Spark Streaming.

23
00:02:01.131 --> 00:02:05.102
Spark streaming reads

24
00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:10.760
streaming data and
converts it into micro batches

25
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.350
which we call DStreams which is short for
discretized stream.

26
00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:24.736
In this example a 10 second
stream gets converted

27
00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:29.980
into five RDDs using a batch
length of 2 seconds.

28
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.920
Similar to other RDDs,
transformations such as map, reduce,

29
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.515
and filter can be applied to DStreams.

30
00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:45.720
DStreams can be aggregated

31
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.310
into Windows allowing you to apply
computations on sliding window of data.

32
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.165
In this example the Window
size is 4 seconds and

33
00:02:58.165 --> 00:03:01.510
the sliding interval is 2 seconds.

34
00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:09.594
In summary, Spark Streaming is
Spark's library to work with

35
00:03:09.594 --> 00:03:12.260
streaming data in near real time.

36
00:03:14.375 --> 00:03:19.210
DStreams can be used just
like any other RDD and

37
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.940
can go through the same
transformation as batch datasets.

38
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.907
DStreams can create a sliding window to
perform calculations on a window of time.

1
00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:05.776
Now that we know what machine learning
is and have seen some examples of it,

2
00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.010
let's talk about how we
do machine learning.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.015
In this lecture we will get an overview of
the main categories of machine learning

4
00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:13.625
techniques.

5
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.315
After this video you will be able to

6
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.805
describe the main categories of
machine learning techniques and

7
00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:25.469
summarize how supervised learning
differs from unsupervised learning.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.260
There are different categories of
machine learning techniques for

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.150
different types of problems.

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.240
The main categories are listed here.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.630
They are classification,
regression, cluster analysis, and

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.450
association analysis.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.000
We will cover each one in
detail in the following slides.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.830
In classification, the goal is to
predict the category of the input data.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.840
An example of this is predicting the
weather as being sunny, rainy, windy, or

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.080
cloudy.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.260
The input data in this case would be
sensor data specifying the temperature,

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.840
relative humidity, atmospheric pressure,
wind speed, wind direction, etc.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.502
The target or what you're trying to
predict would be the different weather

20
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:14.670
categories, sunny, windy,
rainy, and cloudy.

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.580
Another example is to classify
a tumor as either benign or malignant.

22
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.460
In this case,
the classification is referred to as

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.040
binary classification since
there are only two categories.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400
But you can have many categories as well.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.170
As the weather prediction
problem shown here.

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.080
Another example is to identify hand
written digits as being in one of ten

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.950
categories, zero to nine.

28
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.280
Some more examples of classification
are classifying a tumor from a medical

29
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.710
image as being benign or malignant.

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.430
Predicting whether it
will rain the next day.

31
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.410
Determining if a loan application is
high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk.

32
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.860
Identifying the sentiment of a tweet or

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.990
review as being positive,
negative, or neutral.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.870
When your model has to predict
a numeric value instead of a category,

35
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.380
then the task becomes
a regression problem.

36
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.920
An example of regression is to
predict the price of a stock.

37
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.320
The stock price is a numeric value,
not a category.

38
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.700
So this is a regression task
instead of a classification task.

39
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.480
If you were to predict whether
the stock price will rise or

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.620
fall, then that would be
a classification problem.

41
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.340
But if you're predicting
the actual price of the stock,

42
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.620
then that is a regression problem.

43
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.340
That is the main difference between
classification and regression.

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.250
In classification,
you're predicting a category and

45
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520
in regression,
you're predicting a numeric value.

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.000
Some other examples of regression
are estimating the demand of a product

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570
based on time or season of the year.

48
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.130
Predicting a score on a test,

49
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.210
determining the likelihood of
how effective a drug will be for

50
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.270
a particular patient, predicting
the amount of rain for a region.

51
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.550
In cluster analysis,

52
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.275
the goal is to organize similar
items in your data set into groups.

53
00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:10.120
A very common application of
cluster analysis is referred to as

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.160
customer segmentation.

55
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.227
This means that you're separating your
customer base into different groups or

56
00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:18.054
segments based on customer types.

57
00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:22.833
For example it would be very beneficial
to segment your customers into seniors,

58
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.230
adults and teenagers.

59
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.544
These groups have different likes and
dislikes and

60
00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:29.383
have different purchasing behaviors.

61
00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.569
By segmenting your customers to different
groups you can more effectively provide

62
00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.652
marketing adds targeted for
each groups particular interests.

63
00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:40.750
Note that cluster analysis is
also referred to as clustering.

64
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.810
Some other examples of cluster
analysis are, identifying areas of

65
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.840
similar topography, such as desert region,
grassy areas, mountains etc.

66
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.610
Categorizing different types of
tissues from medical images.

67
00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.080
Determining different groups of weather
patterns, such as snowy, dry, monsoon.

68
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.810
And discovering hot spots for different
types of crime from police reports.

69
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.770
The goal in association analysis is
to come up with a set of rules to

70
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.230
capture associations between items or
events.

71
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.520
The rules are used to determine when
items or events occur together.

72
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.500
A common application of association
analysis is known as market

73
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.300
basket analysis.

74
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.020
Which is used to understand
customer purchasing behavior.

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.000
For example, association analysis can
reveal that banking customers who have

76
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.330
CDs, or Certificates of Deposits,
also tend to be interested in

77
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.970
other investment vehicles such
as money market accounts.

78
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.840
This information can be used for
cross selling.

79
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.020
If you advertise money market accounts to
your customers with CDs they are likely to

80
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.390
open such an account.

81
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.700
According to data mining folklore
a supermarket chain used association

82
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.410
analysis to discover a connection between
two seemingly unrelated products.

83
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.130
They discovered that many
customers who go to the store

84
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.150
late on Sunday night to buy
diapers also tend to buy beer.

85
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.470
This information was then
used to place beer and

86
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.620
diapers close together and
they saw a jump in sales of both items.

87
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.630
This is the famous diaper,
beer connection.

88
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.600
Some other applications of association
analysis are recommending similar

89
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.180
items based on the purchasing behavior or
browsing histories of customers.

90
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.720
Finding items that are often purchased
together, such as garden hose and

91
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.080
potting soil, and

92
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.910
offer sales on these related items at the
same time to drive sales of both items.

93
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.970
Identifying web pages that
are often accessed together so

94
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.070
that you can more efficiently offer up
these related web pages at the same time.

95
00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:49.890
We have now looked at the different
categories of machine learning techniques.

96
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.240
They are classification,
regression, cluster analysis, and

97
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.280
association analysis.

98
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.753
We have also seen some
examples of each category

99
00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:04.764
There is also another categorization
of machine learning techniques, and

100
00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:07.520
that is supervised versus
unsupervised approaches.

101
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.900
In supervised approaches the target,

102
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.830
which is what the model is predicting,
is provided.

103
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.750
This is referred to as having labeled
data because the target is labeled for

104
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.457
every sample that you
have in your data set.

105
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.520
Referring back to our example of
predicting a weather category of sunny,

106
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.940
windy, rainy or cloudy,

107
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.550
every sample in the data set is labeled
as being one of these four categories.

108
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.910
So the data is labeled and predicting the
weather categories is a supervised task.

109
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.740
In general, classification and
regression are supervised approaches.

110
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.200
In unsupervised approaches
on the other hand,

111
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.440
the target that the model is
predicting is unknown or unavailable.

112
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.320
This means that you have unlabeled data.

113
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.130
Going back to our cluster analysis
example of segmenting customers into

114
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.400
different groups.

115
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.180
The samples in your data are not
labeled with the correct group.

116
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.250
Instead, the segmentation is performed
using a clustering technique to group

117
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.660
items based on characteristics
that they have in common.

118
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.560
Thus, the data is unlabeled and

119
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.630
the task of grouping customers into
different segments is an unsupervised one.

120
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.606
In general, cluster analysis and

121
00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:21.751
association analysis
are unsupervised approaches.

122
00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:24.534
In summary,

123
00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:29.000
in this lecture we looked at the different
categories of machine learning techniques.

124
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.210
We discussed classification, regression,
cluster analysis and association analysis.

125
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.370
We also defined what supervised and

126
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.590
unsupervised approaches are,
in machine learning.

1
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.360
In this lecture,
we will review each of the steps in

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.440
the machine learning
process in greater detail.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.360
After this video, you will be able
to explain the goals of each step in

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.989
the machine learning process, and list key
activities in each step in the process.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.840
This is the machine learning process
that we saw in the last lecture.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560
In this lecture,
we will cover each step in more detail.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.640
We will describe the goals
of each step and

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.600
the key activities performed in each step.

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.870
The first step in the data science
process is to acquire the data.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.910
The goal of the step is to identify and

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.270
obtain all data related
to the problem at hand.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.800
First, we need to identify all
related data and the sources.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.330
Keep in mind, that data can come from
different sources such as files,

14
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.940
databases, the internet, mobile devices.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.290
So remember to include all data related
to the problem you're addressing.

16
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
After you've identified your data and
data sources,

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.360
the next step is to collect the data and
integrate data from the different sources.

18
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.570
This may require conversion,
as data can come in different formats.

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.246
And it may also require aligning the data,

20
00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:19.520
as data from different sources may have
different time or spacial resolutions.

21
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.410
Once you’ve collected and integrated your
data, you now have a coherent data set for

22
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.050
your analysis.

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.400
The next step after acquiring data is
to prepare it to make it suitable for

24
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.690
analysis.

25
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.290
There are two parts to this step,
explore data and preprocess data.

26
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.410
We will discuss data exploration first.

27
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.670
In data exploration, you want to
do some preliminary investigation

28
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
in order to gain a better understanding of
the specific characteristics of your data.

29
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.779
This in turn will guide
the rest of the process.

30
00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:58.640
With data exploration,
you'll want to look for

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.250
things like correlations,
general trends, outliers, etc.

32
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.930
Correlations provide information
about the relationship

33
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.280
between variables in your data.

34
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.710
Trends in your data will reveal if the
variable is moving in a certain direction,

35
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.480
such as transaction volume
increasing throughout the year.

36
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.660
Outliers indicate potential
problems with the data, or

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.850
may indicate an interesting data
point that needs further examination.

38
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.680
Without this data exploration activity,

39
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.370
you will not be able to
use your data effectively.

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.680
One way to explore your data is
to calculate summary statistics

41
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.290
to numerically describe the data.

42
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.570
Summary statistics are quantities
that capture various characteristics

43
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.390
of a set of values with a single number,
or a small set of numbers.

44
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.400
Some basic summary statistics that you
should compute for your data set are mean,

45
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.360
median, mode, range and
standard deviation.

46
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
Mean and median are measures of
the location of a set of values.

47
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.440
Mode is the value that occurs most
frequently in your data set, and

48
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.630
range and standard deviation
are measures of spread in your data.

49
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.060
Looking at these measures will give you
an idea of the nature of your data.

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.130
They can tell you if there's
something wrong with your data.

51
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.100
For example, if the range of
the values for age in your data

52
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.020
includes negative numbers, or
a number much greater than a hundred,

53
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.830
there's something suspicious in
the data that needs to be examined.

54
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.230
Visualization techniques
also provide quick and

55
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.570
effective ways to explore your data.

56
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.760
Some examples are, a histogram,

57
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.570
such as the plot shown here,
shows the distribution of the data and

58
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.269
can show skewness or
unusual dispersion in outliers.

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.380
A line plot, like the one in the lower
left, can be used to look at trends in

60
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.080
the data, such as,
the change in the price of a stock.

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.816
A heat map can give you an idea
of where the hot spots are.

62
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:07.315
A scatter plot effectively shows
correlation between two variables.

63
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.585
Overall, there are many types
of plots to visualize data.

64
00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.525
They are very useful in helping
you understand the data you have.

65
00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:19.155
The second part of the prepare
step is preprocess.

66
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.755
So, after we've explored the data, we need
to preprocess the data to prepare it for

67
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:24.405
analysis.

68
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.950
The goal here is to create the data
that will be used for analysis.

69
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.280
The main activities on this
part are to clean the data,

70
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.070
select the appropriate variables to
use and transform the data as needed.

71
00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.375
A very important part of
data preparation is to

72
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.975
clean the data to address quality issues.

73
00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.875
Real world data is nothing.

74
00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:51.275
There are many examples of quality issues
with data from real applications including

75
00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:56.065
missing values, such as income
in a survey, duplicate data,

76
00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:59.615
such as two different records for the same
customer with different addresses.

77
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.670
Inconsistent or invalid data,
such as a six digit zip code.

78
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.110
Noise in the collection of data
that distorts the true values.

79
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:15.180
Outliers, such as a number much
larger than 100 for someone's age.

80
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.700
It is essential to detect and

81
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.230
address these issues that can negatively
affect the quality of the data.

82
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.620
Other activities in data preprocessing
can be broadly categorized as

83
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.140
feature selection and
feature transformation.

84
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.410
Feature selection refers to
choosing the set of features to

85
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.500
use that is appropriate for
the application.

86
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.820
Feature selection can
involve removing redundant or

87
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.420
irrelevant features, combining features,
or creating new features.

88
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.520
During the exploring data step,

89
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.820
you may have discovered that two
features are very correlated.

90
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.460
In that case,
one of these features can be removed

91
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.630
without negatively effecting
the analysis results.

92
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.110
For example,
the purchase price of a product and

93
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.830
the amount of sales tax pain
are very likely to be correlated.

94
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.860
Eliminating the sales tax
amount then will be beneficial.

95
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.330
Removing redundant or irrelevant features
will make the subsequent analysis simpler.

96
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.870
You may also want to combine features or
create new ones.

97
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.580
For example,
adding the applicants education level

98
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.449
as a feature to a loan approval
application would make sense.

99
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.700
There are also algorithms to
automatically determine the most relevant

100
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.940
features based on various
mathematical properties.

101
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.510
Feature transformation maps the data
from one format to another.

102
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.805
Various transformation operations exist.

103
00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:41.470
For example, scaling maps
the data values to a specified

104
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.630
range to prevent any one feature from
dominating the analysis results.

105
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.900
Filtering or aggregation can be used to
reduce noise and variability in the data.

106
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.160
Dimensionality reduction maps the data
to a smaller subset of dimensions

107
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.020
to simplify the subsequent analysis.

108
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.497
We will discuss techniques to prepare
data in more detail later in this course.

109
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.237
After preparing the data to
address data quality issues and

110
00:07:10.237 --> 00:07:13.020
preprocess it to get it in
the appropriate format,

111
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.680
the next step in the machine learning
process is to analyze the data.

112
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.840
The goals of the staff are to
build a machine learning model,

113
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.960
to analyze the data and to evaluate
the results that you get from the model.

114
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.110
The analyze steps starts with this
determining the type of problem you have.

115
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.990
You begin by selecting appropriate machine
learning techniques to analyze the data.

116
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.350
Then you construct the model using
the data that you've prepared.

117
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.220
Once the model is built, you will
want to apply it to new data samples

118
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.450
to evaluate how well the model performs.

119
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.125
Thus data analysis involves selecting
the appropriate technique for

120
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:57.375
your problem, building the model,
then evaluating the results.

121
00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:58.855
As there are a different
types of problems,

122
00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.855
there are also different
types of analysis techniques.

123
00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:03.097
We will cover algorithms for

124
00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:06.785
building machine learning models in a much
more detail in week three of this course.

125
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.260
The next step in the machine learning
process is reporting results from your

126
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.865
analysis.

127
00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:17.020
In reporting your results, it is important
to communicate your insights and

128
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.170
make a case for
what actions should follow.

129
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:22.545
In reporting your results,

130
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:26.945
you will want to think about what to
present, as well as how to present.

131
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:30.912
In deciding what to present, you should
consider what the main results are,

132
00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:33.537
what insights were gained
from your analysis, and

133
00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:36.725
what added value do these insights
bring to the application.

134
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.517
Keep in mind that even negative results
are valuable lessons learned, and

135
00:08:41.517 --> 00:08:44.730
suggest further avenues for
additional analysis.

136
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.150
Remember that all findings
must be presented so

137
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.840
that informs decisions can be made for
next steps.

138
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.780
In deciding how to present,

139
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.460
remember that visualization is an
important tool in presenting your results.

140
00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:01.285
Plots and summary statistics
discussing the explore step

141
00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:03.625
can be used effectively here as well.

142
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:07.095
You should also have tables with
details from your analysis as backup,

143
00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.695
if someone wants to take
a deeper dive into the results.

144
00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:14.785
In summary, you want to report your
findings by presenting your results and

145
00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:17.815
the value added with graphs
using visualization tools.

146
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.710
The final step in
the machine loading process

147
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.600
is to determine what action should be
taken based on the insights gained.

148
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.930
What action should be taken based
on the results of your analysis?

149
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.110
Should you market certain products
to a specific customer segment to

150
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.630
increase sales?

151
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.730
What inefficiency is can be
removed from your process?

152
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.580
What incentives would be effective
in attracting new customers?

153
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.180
Once a specific action
has been determined,

154
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.090
the next step is to implement the action.

155
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.320
Things to consider here include, how can
the action be added to your application?

156
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.020
How will end users be affected?

157
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.030
Assessing the impact of the implemented
action is then necessary to evaluate

158
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.810
the benefits gained.

159
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.820
The results of this assessment
determine next steps,

160
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.960
which could suggest additional analysis or
further opportunities,

161
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.049
which would begin another cycle
of the machine learning process.

162
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.960
In summary, we've looked at the steps in
the machine learning process in detail.

163
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.470
The goals or main activities of each
step were discussed in this lecture.

164
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.570
Remember that this is
an iterative process,

165
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.450
in which each step can be repeated
more than once, and findings from

166
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.750
each step may require a previous step
to be repeated with new information

1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.490
Hello, everyone.
You have probably heard of machine

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.250
learning before, enough to grab your
attention and bring you to this class.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
However, you might be wondering
what machine learning is.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.920
We will talk about that
in this lecture and

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.119
discuss how we can see machine learning
in action in our day-to-day life.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.890
After this video you will be able to
explain what machine learning is.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.440
And list three applications of machine
learning encountered in everyday life.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
Since this course is about machine
learning, lets define what that means.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.470
We hear this term a lot these
days used in many contexts.

10
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.240
So it's good to start out with a solid
definition of what machine learning means.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.200
Machine learning is the field of study
that focuses on computer systems that can

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.850
learn from data.

13
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.360
That is the system's often called
models can learn to perform a specific

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.600
task by analyzing lots of examples for
a particular problem.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.550
For example, a machine learning
model can learn to recognize

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.600
an image of a cat by being shown lots and
lots of images of cats.

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.710
This notion of learning from data
means that a machine learning

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.960
model can learn a specific task
without being explicitly programmed.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.400
In other words, the machine learning
model is not given the step

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.610
by step instructions on how to
recognize the image of a cat.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.910
Instead, the model learns
what features are important

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.030
in determining whether it picture contains
a cat from the data that has analyzed.

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.120
Because the model learns to
perform this task from data

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.250
it's good to know that the amount and
quality of data available for

25
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.110
building the model are important factors
in how well the model learns the task.

26
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.110
Because machine learning
models can learn from data

27
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.420
that can be used to discover hidden
patterns and trends in the data.

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.235
These patterns and trends lead to
valuable insights into the data.

29
00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:57.265
Thus the use of machine learning allows
for data driven decisions to be made for

30
00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:59.095
a particular problem.

31
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.745
So to summarize, the field of machine
learning focuses on the study and

32
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.185
construction of computer systems
that can learn from data

33
00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:08.775
without being explicitly programmed.

34
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:10.025
Machine learning algorithms and

35
00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.355
techniques are used to build models,
to discover hidden patterns and

36
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:16.980
trends in the data allowing for
data-driven decisions to be made.

37
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.840
You may have heard that machine learning
is an inter-disciplinary field.

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.410
This is very true.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.740
Machine learning combines concepts and
methods from many disciplines, including

40
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.830
math, statistics, computer science,
artificial intelligence, and optimization.

41
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.940
In applying machine learning to a problem,

42
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.060
domain knowledge is essential
to the success of end results.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.520
By domain knowledge we mean
an understanding of the application or

44
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.150
business domain.

45
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.070
Knowledge about the application,
the data related to the application, and

46
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.860
how the outcomes will be used are crucial
to driving the process of building

47
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.540
the machine learning model.

48
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.593
So domain knowledge is also an integral
part of a machine learning solution.

49
00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.713
Machine learning has been used in many
different learning application, many of

50
00:03:04.713 --> 00:03:08.410
which you'll probably encounter in your
daily life, perhaps without realizing it.

51
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.030
One application of machine learning that
you likely used this past weekend, or

52
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.650
even just today,
is credit card fraud detection.

53
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.340
Every time you use your credit card,
the current purchase is analyzed

54
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.230
against your history of credit card
transactions to determine if the current

55
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.070
purchase is a legitimate transaction or
a potentially fraudulent one.

56
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.840
If the purchase is very different
from your past purchases, such as for

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.480
a big ticket item in a category that
you had never shown an interest in or

58
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.630
when the point of sales location
is from another country,

59
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.860
then it will be flagged
as a suspicious activity.

60
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.100
In that case,
the transaction may be denied.

61
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.990
Or you may get a call from your
credit card company to confirm that

62
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.760
the purchase was indeed made by you.

63
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.560
This is a very common use of machine
learning that is encountered in

64
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.160
everyday life.

65
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.690
Another example application of machine
learning encountered in daily life is

66
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.140
handwritten digit recognition.

67
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.890
When you deposit a hand-written check into
an ATM, a machine learning process is used

68
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.660
to read the numbers written on the check
to determine the amount of the deposit.

69
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.420
Handwritten digits are trickier
to decipher than typed digits

70
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.150
due to the many variations
in people's handwriting.

71
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.130
A machine learning system can sift through
the different variations to find similar

72
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.770
patterns to distinguish a one from a nine,
for example.

73
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.930
Recommendations in what sites is
another example application of

74
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.460
machine learning that most people
have experienced first hand.

75
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.160
After you buy an item on a website you
will often get a list of related items.

76
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.100
Often this will be displayed
as customers who bought this

77
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.380
item also bought these items,
or you may also like.

78
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.130
These related items have been associated
with the item you purchased by

79
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.650
a machine learning model, and

80
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.380
are now being shown to you since
you may also be interested in them.

81
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.160
This is a common application of
machine learning used often in

82
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.040
sales and marketing.

83
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.600
Here are some other examples of where
machine learning has been used.

84
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.360
Like targeted ads on mobile devices.

85
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.490
Sentiment analysis of social media data,

86
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.570
climate monitoring to detect seasonal
patterns, crime pattern detection, and

87
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.910
a healthiness analysis of drugs
among many other applications.

88
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580
As you can see from this short list,

89
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
machine learning has been used in
various applications including science,

90
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.910
medicine, retail, law enforcement,
education and many others.

91
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.190
Let's take a few minutes to discuss the
different terms which refer to this field.

92
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.290
The term we are using for this course is
machine learning, but you may have heard

93
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.080
other terms such as data mining,
predictive analytics and data slangs.

94
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480
So what is the difference
between these different terms?

95
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.740
As we have discussed, machine learning
has its roots since statistics,

96
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.590
artificial intelligence, and
computer science among other fields.

97
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.100
Machine learning encompasses
the algorithms and

98
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.990
techniques used to learn from data.

99
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.560
The term data mining became popular
around the time that the use

100
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.820
databases became common place.

101
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.980
So data mining was used to refer to
activities related to finding patterns in

102
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.780
databases and data warehouses.

103
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.290
There are some practical data management
aspects to data mining related to

104
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.380
accessing data from databases.

105
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.460
But the process of finding
patterns in data is similar, and

106
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.320
can use the same algorithms and
techniques as machine learning.

107
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.020
Predictive analytics refers to analyzing
data in order to predict future outcomes.

108
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.090
This term is usually used in the business
context to describe activities such as

109
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.540
sales forecasting or predicting
the purchasing behavior of a customer.

110
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.060
But again the techniques used to make
these predictions are the same techniques

111
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.790
from machine learning.

112
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.205
Data science is a new term that is
used to describe processing and

113
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:57.860
analyzing data to extract meaning.

114
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.890
Again machine learning techniques
can also be used here.

115
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.260
Because the term data science became
popular at the same time that big

116
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.670
data began appearing, data science usually
refers to extracting meaning from big data

117
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.380
and so includes approaches for collecting,
storing and managing big data.

118
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.370
These terms evolved at different times and

119
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.050
may have encompassed
different sets of activities.

120
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.115
But there have always been more
similarities than differences between

121
00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:23.610
them.

122
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.720
Now they are often used
interchangeably and

123
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.370
have come to mean
essentially the same thing.

124
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.127
The process of extracting valuable insight
from data, the core algorithms and

125
00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:36.891
techniques for doing this do not
change with different terms.

126
00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:42.544
To summarize, in this lecture we've
discussed what machine learning is and

127
00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:44.210
how it is being used.

128
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.590
Machine learning models learn from data to
perform a task without being explicitly

129
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.730
programmed.

130
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.650
They are used to discover patterns and
trends in the data.

131
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.060
And a lab for data driven decisions to
be made for the problems being studied.

132
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.550
We also discuss in this lecture examples
of how machine learning is being used.

133
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.840
We see how the example applications
that machine learning can be applied

134
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.320
to many different areas.

1
00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.610
What are the steps in
the Machine Learning Process?

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.180
We will discuss those in this lecture.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.500
After this video, you will be able
to identify the steps in the machine

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.390
learning process and discuss why
the machine learning process is iterative.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.400
This diagram illustrates the steps
in the machine learning process.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.800
In this lecture,
we will cover an overview of these steps.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.640
In the next lecture,
we will cover each step in more detail.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.040
It should be kept in mind that all of
these steps need to be carried out with

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.130
a clear purpose in mind.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.440
That is, the problem or opportunity that
is being addressed must be defined with

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.220
clearly stated goals and objectives.

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.150
For example,

13
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.590
the purpose of a project may be to study
customer purchasing behavior to come up

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.850
with a more effective marketing strategy
in order to increase sales revenue.

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420
The purpose behind the project will
drive the machine learning process.

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.690
The first step in the machine
learning process is to get

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.020
all available data related
to the problem at hand.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.450
Here, we need to identify all data
sources, collect the data, and

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.800
finally integrate data from
these multiple sources.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.070
The next step in the machine learning
process is to prepare the data.

21
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.920
This step is further divided into two
parts, explore data and pre-process data.

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.550
The first part of data preparation
involves preliminary exploration

23
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.300
of the data to understand the nature
of the data that we have to work with.

24
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.780
Things we want to understand about
the data are its characteristics, format,

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.300
and quality.

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.310
A good understanding of the data
leads to a more informed analysis and

27
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.650
a more successful outcome.

28
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.140
Once we know more about the data
through exploratory analysis,

29
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.240
the next part is pre-processing
of the data for analysis.

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.500
This includes cleaning data,
selecting the variables to use, and

31
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.140
transforming data to make the data more
suitable for analysis in the next step.

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.705
The prepared data then would be
passed on to the analysis step.

33
00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:10.280
This step involves selecting
the analytical techniques to use,

34
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.350
building a model using the data,
and assessing the results.

35
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.930
Step four in the machine learning
process it to communicate results.

36
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.490
This includes evaluating the results with
respect to the goal set for the project.

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.360
presenting the results in
a easy to understand way and

38
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.058
communicating the results to others.

39
00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:32.320
The last step is to apply the results.

40
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.550
This brings us back to
the purpose of the project.

41
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.185
How can the insights from our analysis
be used to provide effective marketing

42
00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.907
to increase sales revenue?

43
00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:45.039
Determining actions from insights gained

44
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.524
from analysis is the main
focus of the act step.

45
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:52.480
Note that the machine learning
process is a very iterative one.

46
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960
Findings from one step may require
a previous step to be repeated

47
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.650
with new information.

48
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.170
For example, during the prepare step, we
may find some data quality issues that may

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.760
require us to go back to the acquire
step to address some issues with data

50
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.550
collection or to get additional data that
we didn't include in the first go around.

51
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.810
Each step may also require
several iterations.

52
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.260
For example, it is common to try different
analysis techniques in the analyze step

53
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.470
in order to get reasonable
results from the model.

54
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.540
So, it is important to recognize that
this is a highly iterative process, and

55
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.320
not a linear one.
