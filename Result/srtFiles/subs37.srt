
1
00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.220
In the first example
of graph analytics for

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.340
big data, we'll consider
the social media called Twitter.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.320
And graphs representing tweets.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.600
What types of objects and
relationships does a tweet have?

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.240
Well, in fact, tweets consist
of many of the same elements and

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.890
relationships as the Facebook posts.

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.380
Tweets have users, they contain text,

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.780
tweets can point to one another or
to URL's, they have hashtags, they can

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.720
include reference to various other types
of media, but what about relationships?

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.120
Well much like Facebook, relationships and

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.660
tweets are more reflective of
what the users do with tweets.

12
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.360
For example, people create tweets,
they respond to tweets,

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.030
they mention other users, and so forth.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.850
Let's look at these
relationships in detail.

15
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.600
In this graph, all of the light
blue notes are tweets, and

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.090
all of the purple notes are users.

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.930
When a specific user
creates a specific tweet,

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.240
an entity is created in
the graph as a result.

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580
We'll come back to this graph
in the next few slides.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.980
So what we want to do with it?

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.820
Well to be very specific,

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.480
this graph was created from tweets
of a bunch of online gamers.

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.220
In this case, we were monitoring
the tweets of all people

24
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.112
who played particular online video game.

25
00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:34.415
Typically, gamers are very
excited about their video games.

26
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.295
They're exited about their characters
of the video games and they want to

27
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:41.695
discuss the video games they're excited
about, when new versions are released.

28
00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.195
So what are the data
science questions here?

29
00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:50.420
People who look at these things, such as
behavioral psychologists, want to know.

30
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.420
If you are a war game user or
if you play any other violent game, where

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.830
there is a lot of fighting online, do
these people also show violent behavior?

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.110
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

33
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.430
They also want to know whether as a result
of looking at somebody's tweets and

34
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.610
following them over time they can tell if
the person is addicted to the game or not.

35
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.190
So why use graphs for that?

36
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.850
One of the things you could
do is what we showed here,

37
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.210
from the graphs you can extract
certain elements like conversations.

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.320
If you look at it, you will see all of
them have somebody posting something.

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.100
Somebody responding to the post, and the
first person responding to the response.

40
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.390
They are retweeting, and
they are responding, and so forth.

41
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.478
You would see a conversation chain
going on which can be short or long,

42
00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.940
like you see, and
other people would join in.

43
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.140
We don't know if it's violent or not, but

44
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.909
at least there is a lively
conversation going on about something.

45
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.870
Using graphs, we could find some
meaningful parts of a graph

46
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.600
that we can further analyze using
techniques like text analytics.

47
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.870
Another kind of thing people
would like to identify,

48
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.170
is which players are interacting
with which other players?

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.580
Who are these people?

50
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.550
Do they form a close community?

51
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.470
Can anybody join in?

52
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.060
Are there groups, what are the groups?

53
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.870
If you find a group,
who are the most influential users?

54
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.740
Who are the people that everybody
refers to, listens to and so on?

55
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.989
Graph analytics is used to answer all
these questions about a conversation

56
00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.467
that's going on live in
social media stream.

57
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.681
Let's look at our next example.

1
00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.230
Our second use case is about biology.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.790
Interactions arise naturally in biology.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.120
Genes produce proteins, proteins regulate
the functions of other proteins,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.970
cells transmit signals to other cells.

5
00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.610
These functional genes lead to
pathological conditions that

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.980
present themselves as
observable phenotypes.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520
Some of these interactions that are
observed and measured by experiment lists.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.770
Another class of graph relations
represent human knowledge.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.390
For example, an edge may denote
an anatomical association, such as

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.986
the nucleuses inside a cell, part of
the cerebral cortex is part of the brain.

11
00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:47.820
Similarly, one can encode different

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.950
classifications of entities like
both humans and dogs and mammals.

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.980
Researchers also find these
relationships from literature

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.890
or by computational techniques
like bioinformatics algorithms.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.120
There are many bioinformatics algorithms
that find statistical correlations between

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.880
genes and proteins.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.070
Many biological networks are created by
creating edges between entities because

18
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.140
they are strongly correlated based on
measurements like gene expression level.

19
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
Yet, a third category of
computed relationships

20
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.090
associates terms by mining
scientific literature.

21
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.320
If two entities are co-mentioned
in scientific articles very often,

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.100
then there is a likelihood that
these two entities are related.

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.910
In this case, the edge between them does
not depict a specific relationship, but

24
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.670
the fact they are associated.

25
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.360
All these interactions can be assembled
into networks of graphs where the nodes

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.800
are biological entities and
edges represent different categories of

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.012
molecular interactions,
associations between diseases and.

28
00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:05.400
Now there are two issues I
would like you to understand.

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.150
First, graphs like the one
we saw are assembled.

30
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.160
That is, integrated from many data sources
produced by many independent science

31
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.600
groups who have different research goals,
use different scientific techniques,

32
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.120
but the underlying biological entities
are common across many groups.

33
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.690
It is the commonality that helps us
stitch together these logic graphs.

34
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.950
Second, as more results get linked and
integrated, the size of the networks grow,

35
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.370
leading to big data problems and
the need for big data technology.

36
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.050
Now let's ask the same question.

37
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.660
Why graphs?

38
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.060
In bio medicine people are always
trying to discover new science, for

39
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.810
instance, they want to discover
unknown relationships.

40
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.600
For example, they can take two diseases,
very different diseases, colorectal

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.048
cancer and Alzheimers disease, and
they might want to ask are they related?

42
00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:11.210
If so, can you connect the dots and

43
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.270
find out what the intervening
network between them is?

44
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.310
It turns out, as you can see,
there are several genes that directly or

45
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.080
indirectly connect these two diseases.

46
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.726
Thus, we can use path finding techniques
like this to discover previously

47
00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.939
unknown connections in a network.

48
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.380
In addition,

49
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.570
researchers sometimes think to explore the
networks to help their discovery process.

50
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.510
I have collaborated with a group that
is using graph exploration techniques

51
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.570
to figure out how phenotypes of
undiagnosed diseases all fit together.

1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.600
Our third use case is about
the human information network.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.870
That means a personal information network.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.680
The graphic you see there
is my LinkedIn network.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.060
Everybody who is on my LinkedIn is a node.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.500
And if they know each other,
there's an edge between them.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.880
You can possibly see some groups or
clusters there.

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.240
One analytical question
we'll explore in module two

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.440
is how to discover these
groups automatically.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.310
Now of course with LinkedIn we only
have professional information.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.130
But it is prudent to ask whether

11
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.340
one can integrate the professional network
with other forms of personal information.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.440
This would be other social media data like
my friendship network from Facebook or

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.230
Google, or it could be information
like my Outlook email network.

14
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.060
One can add even more information and
put that interpersonal relationships.

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.490
For example, Professor Norman who is
on my contact list is my director.

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.860
And if we add my calendar to this,

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.980
one can find events that I'll be attending
and people that I will be meeting.

18
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.431
Taking it even further, for

19
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.949
special applications you might
actually include financial and

20
00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:24.956
business transactions, or
performance in activities,

21
00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:29.671
or fitness information, or
the location from my GPS.

22
00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:36.360
Now, if you add all of these questions, we
should ask what we do with these things?

23
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.920
Let's see.

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.910
One use of this kind of
information is matching.

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.960
For example, matching people with jobs
is not just a matter of screening

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.840
series based on job descriptions or
evaluating their job experience.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.890
To recruit for high level positions,
like the board of directors of a company,

28
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.210
you need to evaluate the network of the
candidate to determine their relationships

29
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.850
with important organizations,
groups, and individuals.

30
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.900
For some tasks like choosing a surgeon,

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.230
you might also want inspect
their social media ratings.

32
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.830
In other classic applications,
we might want to look for

33
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.630
people who can influence a human network.

34
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.960
Suppose, we are in an election
campaign team, and

35
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.620
need our message to get to as many
people as possible in a city.

36
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.800
We can not go door to door ourselves,
we need to go to some people, and

37
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
these people will reach
others on our behalf.

38
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.150
Graph analytic techniques may help
identify the fewest number of people

39
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.610
who will have maximal reach into most
of the potential voters in the city.

40
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.250
A third category of application
is threat detection.

41
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.076
This network is created
by groups who study news.

42
00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.390
For example,
they collect information about all

43
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.670
the militant groups in different countries
and all the reported acts of terrorism.

44
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.460
This creates a network as you can see.

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.266
We show only a part of the network.

46
00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:14.203
In this graph view,
the green notes are groups and

47
00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.406
the pink notes are deemed individuals.

48
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.920
It should be clear that some
of these individuals and

49
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.050
groups are more closely
associated than others.

50
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.057
Discovering and tracking these groups,
their current activities,

51
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:33.685
together with an analysis of details of
the events they're associated with might

52
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:36.904
help analysts to get deeper
insight into the networks and

53
00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:39.604
perhaps anticipate their
future activities.

1
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.350
Our fourth and
last use case has to do with smart cities.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.820
Now, a city is a geographically
bounded space, and

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.630
contains many different networks
operating within the same spatial domain.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.140
What kind of networks?

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.640
Let's see.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.820
It has transportation networks.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.870
Water and sewage networks,
power transmission networks,

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.990
your IP broadband networks.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.670
Some of these networks have
multiple subtypes, for

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.520
example transportation networks include
the bus networks, the subway network,

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
the surface street network, and
the railway network, and so on.

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.380
These networks form a physical
infrastructure and therefore

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.500
can be represented as graphs where
each node has a geographic coordinate.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.400
But some of these networks can also be
thought of as a commodity flow network.

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.560
People flow through
transportation networks.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.330
Sewage material flows through
a sewage network and so on.

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.710
For many of these networks,

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.100
a city planner would like to make
sure that they cover the entire city,

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.920
that commute time is optimized,
traffic congestions are well planned.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.380
To accomplish this, they would need to
create what's called a network model.

21
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.210
For example, urban planners develop
city traffic model servicing.

22
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.320
A traffic model will use both
the geographic layout and

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.080
connectivity of the network along
with the flow parameters like

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.610
the number of commuters getting
on board at any station.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.170
Well, if we're planning
to create a smart hub,

26
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.900
we need to make sure that all the right
things happen at the same place.

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700
People who come out of a metro
station find nearby businesses.

28
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.630
They find nearby facilities.

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.060
Those facilities should
have broadband network for

30
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.433
people who are going to go
on their mobile phones.

31
00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:59.550
The same places need to have
a water supply network, and

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.560
you have to plan it in such
a way that all these networks

33
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.750
who exist within a certain
distance of each other.

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.910
And all the facilities can
be planned accordingly.

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.120
Beyond normal operations,

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.010
we also need to model what would
happen if the network gets disrupted.

37
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.970
What are the kinds of congestion or
traffic that might disturb the network?

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.000
Therefore these graphs are no longer just
structures, but they represent things like

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.140
congestions, things like people's behavior
and materials behavior over the network.

40
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.030
One should also compute
energy use patterns for

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.240
the busy parts of the network in order to
figure out how the network structure or

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.370
the network flow can be altered to
enable energy optimal operations.

43
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.130
As we saw in these four examples,

44
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.700
what graphs are used for
are kind of different but

45
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.380
they all show different view points from
which you can use graphs for analysis.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
So this course focuses on Graph Analytics.

47
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.220
I would like to briefly
recap what the term means.

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.900
Analytics is the ability to
discover meaningful patterns and

49
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.280
interesting insights into data using
mathematical properties of data.

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.410
It covers a process of computing
with mathematical properties and

51
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.590
accessing the data itself efficiently.

52
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.110
Further, it involves
the ability to represent and

53
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.060
work with domain knowledge as we
saw in use case two with biology.

54
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.350
Finally, analytics often involves
statistical modeling techniques for

55
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.310
drawing inferences and
making predictions on data.

56
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.195
With analytics, we should be able
to achieve the goals shown here.

57
00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.375
Therefore, Graph Analytics
is a special piece of

58
00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.980
analytics where the underlying data
can be modeled as a set of graphs.

1
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.750
In the previous video,
we learned what a graph is.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.550
We gained insight into both
the mathematician's view and

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.700
the computer scientist's view.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.310
Now we want to look at the big
picture of graph analytics.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.210
Why are we doing what we are doing, and

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.090
why do I need a graph
representation on graph analytics?

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.730
Let's start with a graph network which you
may already be familiar with, Facebook.

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.770
Here is my Facebook page.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.820
Let's look at it and
consider some of the elements it contains.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.340
There is a primary user, and that's me.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.860
There are my friends.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.310
And typically there are some posts,
some of which may have media in them,

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.800
such as video.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.380
What else does it have?

15
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.619
Well, let's consider what's inside a post.

16
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.281
The post contains text.

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.434
It has tags.

18
00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.700
I tag some people,
some people comment on my post.

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.240
If somebody's commenting,

20
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.330
then that means there must be a commenter
who is also a user in the Facebook.

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.340
Other people like my post or

22
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.550
they like a comment and
they also respond to some of the comments.

23
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.940
Many posts have locations
associated with them as well.

24
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.380
When we consider all of these together,
do you see the graph?

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.910
Well if not, we'll show you.

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Here, we see very much the same types of
information but now they're in a graph.

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.300
First, notice me on the far left.

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.878
If you look carefully at this graph you'll
also notice there are relations labeled

29
00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:49.830
Friend-of and Created_post and parts
of the post and everything that you saw

30
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.400
before that are now organized in terms of
objects and relationship speaking objects.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.250
The objects here on the post, comments on
the post, replies to the comments and so

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.880
forth, and the relationships also
include tagged in or refers to.

33
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.330
So this is sort of the big picture, right?

34
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.380
Next we will look at 4 specific
Use Cases in four different disciplines.

35
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.110
The first one will be on Social Media.

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.020
The second one will be on biology,
where we'll look at genes and diseases.

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.440
The third one will be Human Information
Network, which means personal information.

38
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.750
And the fourth one will
be on smart cities.

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.790
Let's go through these
examples one by one.
