00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.427
This is the first of two hands
on exercises involving CSV Data.

2
00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:12.568
In this exercise, we will import
a CSV file into a spreadsheet and

3
00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:13.860
make a simple plot.

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.350
We will begin by opening a terminal window
and looking at a CSV file in the terminal.

5
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.330
Next, we will start
the spreadsheet application and

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.410
import the CSV data into the spreadsheet.

7
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.760
We can then look at the rows and columns
of the CSV file and make a simple plot.

8
00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:35.837
Let's begin, first,
open a terminal shell by

9
00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:39.423
clicking on the black terminal
icon at the top of the toolbar.

10
00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.914
Next, let's cd into the directory
containing the CSV data.

11
00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:58.587
We'll run cd space
Download/big-data-2/csv.

12
00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:04.042
We can run ls to

13
00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:11.325
see the CSV files.

14
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:16.190
The file census.csv contains
census data for the United States.

15
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.367
We can run the command more census.csv
to see the contents of this file.

16
00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:32.925
The first line of this file is the header
with the columns separated by commas.

17
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.705
You can go down in
the file by hitting space.

18
00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:42.735
Hit Q to quit more.

19
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.210
Next, let's start
a spreadsheet application.

20
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.446
We run oocalc to start this.

21
00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:04.453
We can import the census
data CSV file into

22
00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:08.598
the spreadsheet by going to File > Open.

23
00:02:12.568 --> 00:02:16.067
Clicking on downloads.

24
00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:22.468
Big Data 2, CSV, census.csv.

25
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:29.109
In this dialog click OK.

26
00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.355
You can see into this spreadsheet,

27
00:02:47.355 --> 00:02:50.900
import of the CSV data to
a bunch of rows and columns.

28
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.460
Each column that was separated
by a comma in the CSV file,

29
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.580
is a column in the spreadsheet.

30
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.590
We can see that our CSV file
was successfully imported into

31
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.250
the spreadsheet.

32
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.892
If we scroll down to
the bottom of the spreadsheet,

33
00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.094
we can see how many rows
there were in the CSV file.

34
00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:25.372
There are 3194 rows in the CSV file.

35
00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:29.149
If this file instead had millions or
10 millions of rows,

36
00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.237
then we would have to use a big
data system such as Hadoop or HDFS.

37
00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.089
Let's scroll back to the top.

38
00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:49.351
Next, let's make a simple plot of
some of the data in the CSV file.

39
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:54.993
Let's plot the population estimates for
several years for the state of Alabama.

40
00:03:54.993 --> 00:04:00.558
The state of Alabama is
given in the second row and

41
00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:06.813
the population estimates
are given in these columns.

42
00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:12.225
Let's select J through O,
so you get the population

43
00:04:12.225 --> 00:04:16.657
estimate for 2010 through 2015.

44
00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:24.331
We can create a plot of these values
by clicking on the Chart button.

45
00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:32.806
And clicking finish.

46
00:04:32.806 --> 00:04:36.442
In the second hands on for CSV data,
we'll perform some filtering and

47
00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.669
some aggregate operations over the data.
