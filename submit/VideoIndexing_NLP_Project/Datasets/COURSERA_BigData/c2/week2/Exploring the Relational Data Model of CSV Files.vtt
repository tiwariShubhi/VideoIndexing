00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.969
This is the second hands on exercises for
CSV data.

2
00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:10.155
In the first, we saw how to import
a CSV file into a spreadsheet and

3
00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.430
make a simple plot.

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.240
In this one,
we will learn how to filter data and

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.830
perform some aggregate operations.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.659
We will begin by opening a terminal
window and starting a spreadsheet.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.440
Next, we will load the CSV
data into the spreadsheet and

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.490
perform a filter over several columns.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.398
Finally, we will calculate an average and
sum from the data.

10
00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.313
Let's begin.

11
00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:39.470
First, we open a terminal window by
clicking on the terminal icon in

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.290
the top toolbar.

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.296
We can start the spreadsheet
by writing oocalc.

14
00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:54.590
Next, let's load our CSV
data into the spreadsheet.

15
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.142
We click on File > Open, CENSUS.CSV.

16
00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:08.426
And click OK on this
dialog to load the data.

17
00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:17.344
Column F in the spreadsheet is the state,
and

18
00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:22.704
column H is the census population for
2010.

19
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.480
Let's create a filter that
just shows the data for

20
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.920
California, for
counties larger than one million people.

21
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.030
We can create this filter by first
selecting both the state name column and

22
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210
the census 2000 population column.

23
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.054
Next we go to data,
filter, standard filter.

24
00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:56.025
Here we change the field
name to be the state name,

25
00:01:56.025 --> 00:02:01.061
the condition we leave at equals and
the value we use California.

26
00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:11.055
This filters all the rows,
unless the state is California.

27
00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:16.498
We then want to filter for

28
00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:20.590
all the counties whose population
is greater than one million people.

29
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.400
To do that, in this second line here,
we change the operator to AND.

30
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.710
The field name should be
census 2010 population and

31
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.040
the condition should be greater than.

32
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.431
Then set the value to be one million.

33
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.893
And click OK.

34
00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:49.603
We can see that all the data from the
spreadsheet has disappeared except where

35
00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.559
the state name is California and

36
00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.762
the population is greater
than one million people.

37
00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.110
We can reset or remove this
filter to see all the data again

38
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.240
by going to Data > Filter.

39
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.020
Reset filter.

40
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.550
You can perform aggregate operations
on the data in a spreadsheet.

41
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.830
Next, let's perform some aggregate
operations over the data.

42
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.220
We can compute the average and
the sum of the data.

43
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.980
To do this, let's run these
calculations in a separate sheet.

44
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.181
Create a new sheet by clicking
on the green plus button.

45
00:03:31.854 --> 00:03:37.656
To compute the average we select
a cell and enter =Average( and

46
00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:43.470
then we select the data that we
want to compute the average from.

47
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.150
If we go back to sheet one.

48
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.190
We can select some of
the data from the H column.

49
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.634
So let's just choose several
counties in Alabama.

50
00:03:54.634 --> 00:03:58.267
When we hit Enter,
it takes us back to sheet one and

51
00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:01.306
we can see that the average is computing.

52
00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:12.220
Similarly, we can compute the sum
by entering =sum, open parentheses.

53
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.120
Going back to sheet one and
selecting the columns we want to sum.

54
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.360
When we're done hit Enter and
the sum is computed.
