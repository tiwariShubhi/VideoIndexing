00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.736
In this hands-on activity,

2
00:00:01.736 --> 00:00:05.270
we'll be looking at real time
data streaming from Twitter.

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.750
First, we'll open a terminal window and

4
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.520
cd into the directory containing
Python scripts to access this data.

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.750
Next, we'll look at the contents
of tweets streaming from Twitter

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.220
containing specific words.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.230
Finally, we will plot the frequency
of these streaming tweets.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.810
Let's begin.

9
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.259
First, click on the terminal
icon at the top of the toolbar.

10
00:00:33.485 --> 00:00:38.414
Let cd into the directory containing
the python scripts to access the real time

11
00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:40.400
data from Twitter.

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.473
We'll run CD downloads big-data-2 json.

13
00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:55.828
We can run ls to see
the files in this directory.

14
00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:07.200
The file auth should be created containing
your Twitter authentication information.

15
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.434
You could see the separate reading for
how to setup the Twitter app and

16
00:01:11.434 --> 00:01:12.617
how to create this file.

17
00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:20.958
Next, let's run the script live tweets
to view tweets in real time containing

18
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:22.093
a specific word.

19
00:01:22.093 --> 00:01:27.819
Let's run LiveTweets.py president.

20
00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:36.267
This will show the real time tweets
containing the word president.

21
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.280
[INAUDIBLE] Runs, in the first column,
you can see the time stamp of the tweet.

22
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.500
In the second column,
you can see the text.

23
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.471
When you're done, hit Ctrl + C.

24
00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:04.836
Let's run LiveTweet again using
a different keyword that appear more

25
00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:06.260
frequently.

26
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.448
Let's use the word time,
we'll run LiveTweet time

27
00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:30.780
When we're done, hit Ctrl + C.

28
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.900
We can plot the frequency of these Tweets
by running the script plot Tweets.

29
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.373
Let's run plot, tweet, president to see
the frequency for the word president.

30
00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.466
As this runs, we could see
the frequency changes over time.

31
00:03:19.557 --> 00:03:21.960
I can see that the maximum was one.

32
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.540
And a few times,
there were just one tweet in that second.

33
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.180
When you're done looking at the graph,

34
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.930
click in the terminal window and
hit Enter.

35
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.010
Now, let's plot the frequency for
the word time.

36
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.645
Run PlotTweets.py time.

37
00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:02.500
This plot shows that the word time appears
a lot more frequently than president.

38
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.514
We can see spikes in the frequency
of 40 and a maximum of around 65.

39
00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:12.663
When you're done looking at the graph,

40
00:04:12.663 --> 00:04:16.840
click on the terminal window and
press enter to quit.
