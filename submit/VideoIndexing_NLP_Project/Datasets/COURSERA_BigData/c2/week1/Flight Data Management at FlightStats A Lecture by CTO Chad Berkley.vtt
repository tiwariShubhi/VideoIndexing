00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.820
Hi, my name is Chad Berkley.

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.750
I'm the CTO of FlightStats, and I'm here
today to talk to you a little bit about

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.740
our platform and
how we acquire and process data.

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.320
But first of all, I'd like to start by
just kind of introducing the company and

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.540
telling you a little bit
about what we're all about.

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.940
So FlightStats is a data company and

7
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.340
we basically are the leading provider
of global real-time flight status data.

8
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.110
We pull in data from over 500 sources and
we aggregate that data back together, and

9
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.140
we sell it out to our customers which our
other businesses as well as consumers.

10
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.920
So just to give you a little bit
of information about the scope and

11
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.460
scale of what we do.

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.210
Like I said,
we have over 500 sources of data.

13
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.300
And on a daily basis,
we process about 15 million flight events,

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.380
those that includes landings,
arrivals, departures.

15
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.600
Any time the status of the flight changes,
we got some sort of message on that.

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.790
We process about 260 million aircraft
positions per day, so we have an extensive

17
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.980
network that monitors graph positions for
realtime flight tracking applications.

18
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.020
And we also handle about One million PNRs,
or passenger name records,

19
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.590
which are the actual data type
of an itenerary any time you

20
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.520
book travel, a PNR is created for
you, for your travel.

21
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.770
And it includes all of the segments,
like air travel, ferries,

22
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.110
hotels, taxis, Anyhting that
can be scheduled on your trip.

23
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.650
And we basically take in all that data and

24
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.080
we aggregate it together and
we sell it back out.

25
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.930
And how most people kind of know us for
FlightStats.com, that's our

26
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.260
consumer site for business where we
handle about 2 million daily requests.

27
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.550
And we handle about 1
million mobile app requests.

28
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.710
That our b to b side, we cert out a lot
of data by APIs and real time data feeds.

29
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.480
People make about 15 million
API requests to us everyday.

30
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.180
And we also send out about one and half
million flight and trip notifications.

31
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.310
So if you get a push
notification to your phone,

32
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.930
telling you that your flight is delayed or
on time.

33
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.010
That possibly has come from us.

34
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.530
So a little bit about how the data
flows through our company.

35
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.820
We bring in all these
different types of data and

36
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.260
our sources and it flows through
our data acquisition team.

37
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.380
We have a team whose primary purpose
is to pull in all sorts of raw data,

38
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.520
a very heterogeneous datasets.

39
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.150
And process that into a normalized form.

40
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.420
So if you kind of follow the blue arrow
in this diagram you can see that it goes

41
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.840
through this raw data
channel through the data hub.

42
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.660
Which the data hub is a central
component of our system that I'll talk

43
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.000
a little bit more about in a second.

44
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.960
So the blue data, the blue line is
raw data coming in from the source

45
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.300
It goes through our data
acquisition system,

46
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.360
it turns into that purple line
which is a normalized form.

47
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.640
It then goes back through our data hub
again and into our processing engine.

48
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.210
Our processing engine is really where
most of the business logic happens.

49
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.210
The first thing we have to do
is we have to match any piece of

50
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.390
flight information against
a flight that we know about and

51
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.220
primarily the way we know about
flights is through schedules.

52
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.560
So we import schedules on a daily
basis from one of our partner

53
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.510
schedule providers.

54
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.065
That data,
once it's matched is then processed and

55
00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:49.635
the processing basically looks at each
message, and tries to determine if

56
00:03:49.635 --> 00:03:52.825
we think that that message needs
to be passed on to consumers.

57
00:03:52.825 --> 00:03:56.940
So you know it looks at things like,
have we seen that message before.

58
00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.560
Or is it a duplicate?

59
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.530
Is it from a data source that we trust?

60
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.120
Are there other things going on
that we need to know about that

61
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.300
may impact whether that message is true or
not?

62
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.370
And once we decide that a message
should be passed through,

63
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.020
if you follow the green line.

64
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.860
It goes into our process
data channel on our hub, and

65
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.400
it's then pushed out to
a couple different places.

66
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.080
So first of all,

67
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.510
it goes into our production database which
is where all of our real time data lives.

68
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.750
That database serves data to our websites,

69
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.230
to our mobile apps, and
a variety of other places.

70
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.060
It also goes into our
data warehouse which,

71
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.330
is where our analytics products use it.

72
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.670
I'll talk a bit more
about that in a minute.

73
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.910
And then, the stream of data actually
goes up to so many of our customers.

74
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.490
We don't need a database on our side.

75
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.650
They would rather build
a database on their side so

76
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.490
we actually just stream all of
the processed data directly to them.

77
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.930
They then host it within
their own systems.

78
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.920
So a little bit more about the hub, the
hub is central to how we move data around.

79
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.960
It's a technology that
we developed in-house.

80
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.125
And it's an object storage based,
scalable, highly available,

81
00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:15.810
multi-channel data queuing and
eventing system.

82
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.690
The object storage part is,
we use Amazon S3 to store this data.

83
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.310
So it's an object storage system.

84
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.600
It's scalable,
we can scale it horizontally or

85
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.140
vertically depending on, but the what
type of data is flowing through it.

86
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.250
It's highly available meaning,

87
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.350
that we have multiple instances
of it in different data centers.

88
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.410
So if one that goes down we can
easily pull another one up or

89
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.490
it's we're going to cross
multiple instances.

90
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.600
And then it's multi channel.

91
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.030
So it's got a rest interface and
any surface can create

92
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.760
a new channel within the system and
start posting data to it.

93
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.260
That data is then queued based on
the time that it comes in, and

94
00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.490
other services can be listening for
events on those channels.

95
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.240
So, as soon as a new piece of data
comes into one of those channels,

96
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.330
any service that's listening on that
channel, gets an event notification.

97
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.470
They, that service can then
act upon that piece of data.

98
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.700
And do whatever processing
it may need to do.

99
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.690
This project is open source and
anybody can download it and use it.

100
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.230
So a little bit about some of the data
that we collect and aggregate.

101
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.560
And FLIFO is kind of the industry term for
flight information.

102
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.360
And primarily we look at kind of
the five different parts of flight.

103
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.870
So we pull in information on gate
departure, and then that becomes a runway

104
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.855
departure, basically when the wheels
go up, that is a runway departure.

105
00:06:47.855 --> 00:06:54.080
We do in-flight positional tracking,
so when your flight is moving along,

106
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.330
about once every ten seconds we get
notified of its latitude and longitude.

107
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.530
And its heading and its speed and

108
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.790
its vertical center descent rate and
several other variables.

109
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.230
Then once it lands,

110
00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.300
as soon as the wheels touch the ground,
we're notified of a runway arrival and

111
00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.890
when the door is opened at the gate,
we have gate arrival information.

112
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:21.480
All five of these data fields
come in three different forms.

113
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.460
So we have a scheduled,
scheduled departure and arrival.

114
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.310
We have estimated departure and arrival
which can come from a variety of sources,

115
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.710
either airlines, airports,
positional data, et cetera.

116
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.120
And then, we have actuals so
if we have an airport or

117
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.460
an airline that's sending us data about
exactly when the wheels touch down, or

118
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.770
exactly when that door opens on that
aircraft, we push that data as well.

119
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.100
We also generate some
data at flight stops.

120
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.850
So special incidents, if an aircraft
has an issue It's in the news.

121
00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.920
We do flag our content with
a message from our support staff.

122
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.790
We do some prediction.

123
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.030
Right now we're just starting to get into
that market, or we're actually trying to

124
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.490
predict 24 hours out whether a flight
will be delayed, disrupted or on time.

125
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:19.550
We do some synthetic positions,
so over oceans, primarily.

126
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.310
We don't get tracking data
on aircraft over the oceans.

127
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.480
There is currently no satellite-based
tracking system for aircraft.

128
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.010
So we basically take the last
known position a heading, a speed.

129
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.330
And if we have a flight plan, we'll use
a flight plan to synthesize the positions

130
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.140
when we're not getting actual
positions over large bodies of water.

131
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.560
We also generate notifications,
so the push alerts,

132
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.680
the preflight emails,
delay notifications those types of things.

133
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.570
We create those based on what we see
in the data that's coming in to us.

134
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:02.630
We store all of our historical
data in a data warehouse,

135
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.860
so right now we have six years
of historical flight data.

136
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.080
And that powers our analytics products,

137
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.570
so we allow airlines to do competitive
analysis, and route analysis.

138
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.320
Routes are very important to airlines.

139
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.220
That's how they compete
with each other and

140
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.800
that's primarily how they
are judged by the FAA and

141
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.429
other governmental organizations
on whether they're on-time or not.

142
00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:32.070
We also do airport operations analysis
things like taxi in and taxi out times.

143
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.910
Very important for lots of airports,
runway utilization,

144
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.230
hourly passenger flows through airports,
that type of information.

145
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.830
And we do on-time performance metrics so.

146
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.290
Airlines can look at how they're doing.

147
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.020
How many flights did they complete?

148
00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.870
How many flights were on
time within 14 minutes?

149
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.630
And they can compare themselves
to their competitors.

150
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:01.310
So we host all of this in
a hybrid cloud architecture.

151
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.560
Hybrid cloud basically means that we have
our own private datacenter resources and

152
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.120
we also host resources in
the Amazon Web Services cloud.

153
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.680
Most of our core data processing and
service layer is in our private data

154
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.250
center and we're getting ready to spin
up a second private data center as well.

155
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:24.270
Right now, our main data center is in
Portland, Oregon, and we're going to spin

156
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.499
another one up on the east coast of
the United States probably in Q2 or Q3.

157
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:35.050
For our API's we try to keep
those close to our customers so

158
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.810
API end points and
web end points live in Amazon.

159
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:44.170
And they are automatically routed to
whichever end point is closest to you,

160
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.640
you will automatically be routed to them.

161
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.700
All of our private infrastructure
is virtualized with VMWare.

162
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:54.560
We pretty much have a fully
virtualized environment.

163
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:04.870
And we're an Agile shop, so
we have six small, fast teams.

164
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:09.300
Those are product centric teams, we
allow them to be as customer interactive

165
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.610
as they need to be, and
we try to make our teams semi autonomous.

166
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.300
So, teams get to choose their own tools,
they get to choose their

167
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.340
own development methodologies,
they choose a variety of things.

168
00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.020
And We physically allow them

169
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.770
to do what they need to do to get
their job done as quickly as possible.

170
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:30.010
We try to automate everything.

171
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.120
You do something once manually and
then the next time you write a script or

172
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.480
program to do it.

173
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.700
And we also measure everything.

174
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.190
Right now, we're taking in about
2.5 billion metrics per month off

175
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.480
of our systems.

176
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.680
And we use those metrics to monitor
our application performance,

177
00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.890
to monitor revenue, to monitor pretty
much everything we do in the company.

178
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.390
We really try to enable
total system awareness,

179
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.200
everything from the hardware layer
up to the website is monitored.

180
00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.190
And we use industry best practices and
tools and of course, we try to recruit and

181
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.740
hire the best talent possible a little
bit about our software stock.

182
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.140
We're primarily a Java shop.

183
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.830
Our core processing services
are all written in Java.

184
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:15.870
We do use node JS in our
Microservice Edge layer.

185
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:20.090
And node JS is actually starting to move
more down into the processing service

186
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.750
layer as well.

187
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.760
We use many different types of data bases.

188
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.220
Our primary realtime
database is Post Press.

189
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.140
And we use Mongo for
the backend of our API services.

190
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:36.940
On the website, we're all HTML5 and
we're moving to React and Redux, and

191
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:41.750
we're making use of Elasticsearch for
quick searching and indexing on our data.

192
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.750
And, of course, we have iOS and
Android mobile applications.

193
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.610
So you can find out more about
Flightstats on our website.

194
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.950
If you need data for your applications,

195
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.860
please go to the developer center
at developer.flightstats.com.

196
00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.790
You can sign up for
a free test account and

197
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.980
be able to pull data
directly off of our APIs.

198
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.660
If you're interested in the Hub,
like I said that's open source.

199
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.540
Please check out the Git Hub page and
if you have any additional questions,

200
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.270
feel free to contact
myself John Berkeley and

201
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:18.360
I'd be happy to answer any
of your questions via email.

202
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.690
Thanks for listening today and
hope you have a great day.

203
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:21.190
Bye.
