00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome back to the fourth and
final module of the course.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.740
In this module, we'll cover the underlying
principles of large scale graph processing

3
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.800
and the software infrastructure
that supports it.

4
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.440
So, in this module,
you'll learn a programming model for

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.900
graph computation and
systems that implement this model.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.530
After this model, you'll be able to
formulate graph analytics computations

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.930
in terms of the programming model.

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.340
This module will consist of three lessons.

9
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.790
The first lesson, will revisit
the concept of the programming model and

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.720
introduce a programming model
called Bulk Synchronous Parallel or

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.250
BSP that is designed specifically for
graph oriented computation.

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.520
I will discuss two well known versions of
the central idea, Pregel from Google, and

13
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760
Graphlab from Carnegie Mellon University.

14
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.260
The second lesson,
we'll discuss two software systems,

15
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.390
Giraph that operates on Hadoop,
and GraphX that operates on Spark.

16
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.890
We'll compare the basic architecture
of these two systems and

17
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.090
point out their differences.

18
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.170
The final lesson will show example
computations, using graphics platform.

19
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.210
Since graphics come with Spark,

20
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320
we've created these examples on the
virtual machine, which you have access to.

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.181
The code and
some data sets are available for

22
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.849
those who wish to play with the system.
