1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.190
Next, we'll create a new graph by
adding the continents dataset,

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.430
import the GraphStream library,

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.120
import the countriesGraph into
a GraphStream SingleGraph,

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.680
visualize the countriesGraph,
and visualize the Facebook graph.

5
00:00:15.688 --> 00:00:19.510
In this hands-on exercise we
will use the GraphStream library

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.510
to visualize countries graph.

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.180
The metros graph that we have been
working with in the previous exercises.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.990
This time with the continent vertices and
edges added.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.391
Starting again where we left off
from the previous hands-on exercise,

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.970
ensure your [INAUDIBLE] has started and
that you've imported the data.

11
00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.307
First, in order to make
the graph more interesting,

12
00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:50.754
we are going to import additional
vertices from the continent.csv, and

13
00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:54.342
additional edges from
country_continent.csv to create

14
00:00:54.342 --> 00:00:58.520
a relationship between the country and
the continent it belongs to.

15
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.442
We will show the steps for
importing the datasets, but

16
00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:04.351
we do not cover the steps in detail.

17
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:07.111
If you aren't sure how to
import a dataset, go back and

18
00:01:07.111 --> 00:01:09.700
view the video called
hands-on building a graph.

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.250
Now, we are going to concatenate the
metros, countries, and continents vertices

20
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.800
into a single variable and concatenate
the metros to countries edges, and

21
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.010
countries to continent edges
into another single variable.

22
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.271
Finally, you will create a new
graph called countriesGraph.

23
00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:39.540
Now, import the GraphStream library.

24
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.310
We will not go over in detail how
to use the GraphStream library.

25
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.246
You can review its documentation and

26
00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:48.314
other online resources on your
own if you are interested.

27
00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:58.548
First, create a new instance of
GraphStreams SingleGraph class,

28
00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:00.160
using the countriesGraph.

29
00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:12.293
Next, we will set some attributes for
the graph we are going to visualize,

30
00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:14.395
including setting a style for the graph.

31
00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:17.620
GraphStream uses cascading style sheets or

32
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.970
CSS just like ordinary web pages,
to control the appearance of the graph.

33
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.300
The zip file that you downloaded from
Coursera contain the CSS file that we will

34
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.557
use in this hands-on exercise.

35
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.330
Now, load the countries graph
vertices into the visualization

36
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.610
using GraphStreams add node method.

37
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.910
Notice that we are setting
the style UI.class of each vertex

38
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.410
depending on if the vertex is an instance
of the metro, country or continent class.

39
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.470
Add the edges of country's graph to
the visualization using GraphStreams

40
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.220
add edge method.

41
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.740
Finally, call the display
method to visualize the graph.

42
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.090
The graph will look similar to this.

43
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.260
The small blue dots are the metropolises,
the medium sized red dots

44
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.470
are the countries, and
the large green dots are the continents.

45
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.590
By looking at the clusters
you can easily identify which

46
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.790
continent in the visualization
is Antarctica.

47
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.780
It is the green dot that
has no connections or

48
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.500
it is the least connected
cluster in the network.

49
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.950
I hope your paying attention,
because this will be on the quiz.

50
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.205
The large cluster of dots at the bottom is
Asia because it has the most countries and

51
00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:32.380
metropolises in the graph.

52
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.360
The Asia cluster is the most
connected cluster in the network.

53
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.980
Can you identify which clusters
are the other continents

54
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.330
by looking at the visualization?

55
00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:50.572
Let's look at the visualization
of a much larger dataset,

56
00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:53.904
the Facebook dataset with 90,000 vertices.

57
00:03:53.904 --> 00:03:57.244
You've seen these techniques
before with the metro dataset, but

58
00:03:57.244 --> 00:04:00.230
that graph had only around 90 vertices.

59
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.736
Because we want you to learn the concepts,
not be bogged down with repetitive tasks,

60
00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:09.321
we've supplied this Cloudera file in order
to create the visualization of the graph.

61
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:12.230
All you need to do is open
a new terminal window.

62
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.122
Go into the examples of
analytic directory and

63
00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:19.546
run the spark shell with
the Facebook.Cloudera file.

64
00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:22.610
Don't worry about copying
the full command from the video.

65
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.340
A text version will be included
within the course reading

66
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.230
that contains the full command for
you to copy and paste.

67
00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:35.050
What do you see?

68
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.560
My first reaction is that
it looks like broccoli.

69
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.560
A green vegetable reviled by many
American children, unjustly.

70
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.790
Social networks are made up of
several clusters of communities or

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.700
pockets of people who interact densely

72
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.570
that are brought together by people who
are members of multiple communities.

73
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.380
This interlinking of clusters
gives the social network

74
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.140
a broccoli like shape when visualized.

75
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.218
I hope you heard the last thing I said
because that will be on the quiz.
