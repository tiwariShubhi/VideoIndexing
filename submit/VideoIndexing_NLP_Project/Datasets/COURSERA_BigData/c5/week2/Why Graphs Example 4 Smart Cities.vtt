00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.350
Our fourth and
last use case has to do with smart cities.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.820
Now, a city is a geographically
bounded space, and

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.630
contains many different networks
operating within the same spatial domain.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.140
What kind of networks?

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.640
Let's see.

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.820
It has transportation networks.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.870
Water and sewage networks,
power transmission networks,

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.990
your IP broadband networks.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.670
Some of these networks have
multiple subtypes, for

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.520
example transportation networks include
the bus networks, the subway network,

11
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
the surface street network, and
the railway network, and so on.

12
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.380
These networks form a physical
infrastructure and therefore

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.500
can be represented as graphs where
each node has a geographic coordinate.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.400
But some of these networks can also be
thought of as a commodity flow network.

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.560
People flow through
transportation networks.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.330
Sewage material flows through
a sewage network and so on.

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.710
For many of these networks,

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.100
a city planner would like to make
sure that they cover the entire city,

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.920
that commute time is optimized,
traffic congestions are well planned.

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.380
To accomplish this, they would need to
create what's called a network model.

21
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.210
For example, urban planners develop
city traffic model servicing.

22
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.320
A traffic model will use both
the geographic layout and

23
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.080
connectivity of the network along
with the flow parameters like

24
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.610
the number of commuters getting
on board at any station.

25
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.170
Well, if we're planning
to create a smart hub,

26
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.900
we need to make sure that all the right
things happen at the same place.

27
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.700
People who come out of a metro
station find nearby businesses.

28
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.630
They find nearby facilities.

29
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.060
Those facilities should
have broadband network for

30
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.433
people who are going to go
on their mobile phones.

31
00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:59.550
The same places need to have
a water supply network, and

32
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.560
you have to plan it in such
a way that all these networks

33
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.750
who exist within a certain
distance of each other.

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.910
And all the facilities can
be planned accordingly.

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.120
Beyond normal operations,

36
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.010
we also need to model what would
happen if the network gets disrupted.

37
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.970
What are the kinds of congestion or
traffic that might disturb the network?

38
00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.000
Therefore these graphs are no longer just
structures, but they represent things like

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.140
congestions, things like people's behavior
and materials behavior over the network.

40
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.030
One should also compute
energy use patterns for

41
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.240
the busy parts of the network in order to
figure out how the network structure or

42
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.370
the network flow can be altered to
enable energy optimal operations.

43
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.130
As we saw in these four examples,

44
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.700
what graphs are used for
are kind of different but

45
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.380
they all show different view points from
which you can use graphs for analysis.

46
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.510
So this course focuses on Graph Analytics.

47
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.220
I would like to briefly
recap what the term means.

48
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.900
Analytics is the ability to
discover meaningful patterns and

49
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.280
interesting insights into data using
mathematical properties of data.

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.410
It covers a process of computing
with mathematical properties and

51
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.590
accessing the data itself efficiently.

52
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.110
Further, it involves
the ability to represent and

53
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.060
work with domain knowledge as we
saw in use case two with biology.

54
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.350
Finally, analytics often involves
statistical modeling techniques for

55
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.310
drawing inferences and
making predictions on data.

56
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.195
With analytics, we should be able
to achieve the goals shown here.

57
00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.375
Therefore, Graph Analytics
is a special piece of

58
00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:02.980
analytics where the underlying data
can be modeled as a set of graphs.
