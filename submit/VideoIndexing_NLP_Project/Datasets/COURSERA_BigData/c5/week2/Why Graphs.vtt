00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.750
In the previous video,
we learned what a graph is.

2
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.550
We gained insight into both
the mathematician's view and

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.700
the computer scientist's view.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.310
Now we want to look at the big
picture of graph analytics.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.210
Why are we doing what we are doing, and

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.090
why do I need a graph
representation on graph analytics?

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.730
Let's start with a graph network which you
may already be familiar with, Facebook.

8
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.770
Here is my Facebook page.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.820
Let's look at it and
consider some of the elements it contains.

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.340
There is a primary user, and that's me.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.860
There are my friends.

12
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.310
And typically there are some posts,
some of which may have media in them,

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.800
such as video.

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.380
What else does it have?

15
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.619
Well, let's consider what's inside a post.

16
00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.281
The post contains text.

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.434
It has tags.

18
00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.700
I tag some people,
some people comment on my post.

19
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.240
If somebody's commenting,

20
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:10.330
then that means there must be a commenter
who is also a user in the Facebook.

21
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.340
Other people like my post or

22
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.550
they like a comment and
they also respond to some of the comments.

23
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.940
Many posts have locations
associated with them as well.

24
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.380
When we consider all of these together,
do you see the graph?

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.910
Well if not, we'll show you.

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Here, we see very much the same types of
information but now they're in a graph.

27
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.300
First, notice me on the far left.

28
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.878
If you look carefully at this graph you'll
also notice there are relations labeled

29
00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:49.830
Friend-of and Created_post and parts
of the post and everything that you saw

30
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.400
before that are now organized in terms of
objects and relationship speaking objects.

31
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.250
The objects here on the post, comments on
the post, replies to the comments and so

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.880
forth, and the relationships also
include tagged in or refers to.

33
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.330
So this is sort of the big picture, right?

34
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.380
Next we will look at 4 specific
Use Cases in four different disciplines.

35
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.110
The first one will be on Social Media.

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.020
The second one will be on biology,
where we'll look at genes and diseases.

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.440
The third one will be Human Information
Network, which means personal information.

38
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.750
And the fourth one will
be on smart cities.

39
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.790
Let's go through these
examples one by one.
