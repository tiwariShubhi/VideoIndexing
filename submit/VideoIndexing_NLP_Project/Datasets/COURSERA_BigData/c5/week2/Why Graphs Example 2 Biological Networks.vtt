00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.230
Our second use case is about biology.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.790
Interactions arise naturally in biology.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.120
Genes produce proteins, proteins regulate
the functions of other proteins,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.970
cells transmit signals to other cells.

5
00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.610
These functional genes lead to
pathological conditions that

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.980
present themselves as
observable phenotypes.

7
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.520
Some of these interactions that are
observed and measured by experiment lists.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.770
Another class of graph relations
represent human knowledge.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.390
For example, an edge may denote
an anatomical association, such as

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.986
the nucleuses inside a cell, part of
the cerebral cortex is part of the brain.

11
00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:47.820
Similarly, one can encode different

12
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.950
classifications of entities like
both humans and dogs and mammals.

13
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.980
Researchers also find these
relationships from literature

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.890
or by computational techniques
like bioinformatics algorithms.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.120
There are many bioinformatics algorithms
that find statistical correlations between

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.880
genes and proteins.

17
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.070
Many biological networks are created by
creating edges between entities because

18
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.140
they are strongly correlated based on
measurements like gene expression level.

19
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
Yet, a third category of
computed relationships

20
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.090
associates terms by mining
scientific literature.

21
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.320
If two entities are co-mentioned
in scientific articles very often,

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.100
then there is a likelihood that
these two entities are related.

23
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.910
In this case, the edge between them does
not depict a specific relationship, but

24
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.670
the fact they are associated.

25
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.360
All these interactions can be assembled
into networks of graphs where the nodes

26
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.800
are biological entities and
edges represent different categories of

27
00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.012
molecular interactions,
associations between diseases and.

28
00:02:02.012 --> 00:02:05.400
Now there are two issues I
would like you to understand.

29
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.150
First, graphs like the one
we saw are assembled.

30
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.160
That is, integrated from many data sources
produced by many independent science

31
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.600
groups who have different research goals,
use different scientific techniques,

32
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.120
but the underlying biological entities
are common across many groups.

33
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.690
It is the commonality that helps us
stitch together these logic graphs.

34
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.950
Second, as more results get linked and
integrated, the size of the networks grow,

35
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.370
leading to big data problems and
the need for big data technology.

36
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.050
Now let's ask the same question.

37
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.660
Why graphs?

38
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.060
In bio medicine people are always
trying to discover new science, for

39
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.810
instance, they want to discover
unknown relationships.

40
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.600
For example, they can take two diseases,
very different diseases, colorectal

41
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.048
cancer and Alzheimers disease, and
they might want to ask are they related?

42
00:03:09.048 --> 00:03:11.210
If so, can you connect the dots and

43
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.270
find out what the intervening
network between them is?

44
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.310
It turns out, as you can see,
there are several genes that directly or

45
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.080
indirectly connect these two diseases.

46
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.726
Thus, we can use path finding techniques
like this to discover previously

47
00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.939
unknown connections in a network.

48
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.380
In addition,

49
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.570
researchers sometimes think to explore the
networks to help their discovery process.

50
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.510
I have collaborated with a group that
is using graph exploration techniques

51
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.570
to figure out how phenotypes of
undiagnosed diseases all fit together.
