00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.480
We have already defined
the degree of the node

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.965
as the number of edges connected to it.

3
00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:08.815
Thus specifying if a node is
more connected than another.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.760
Looking closer we can separate out

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.450
that two components denotes
degrees into in degree and out.

6
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.150
Which are the counts of the incident and
the outgoing edges of a node respectively.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.970
In the example graph G has an indegree and

8
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.860
outdegree of three making
the total degree equal to six.

9
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.680
We first construct this degree table for
each node.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.460
It's a simple procedure where we count
the number of nodes with degree.

11
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.960
0, 1, 2, and so forth.

12
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.100
The degree versus count table is
a degree histogram of the graph.

13
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.380
We can compare two graphs by computing
the vector distance between them.

14
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.625
One simplistic measure is
just the Euclidean distance.

15
00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:04.331
For our case, the degree
histogram based on comparisons of

16
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:08.390
the histograms find the graphs
to be very similar.

17
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.036
The more sophisticated
methods are available but

18
00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:14.822
are outside the scope of this course.

19
00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:30.280
We can also compute histograms
of just the in degree or

20
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.380
just the out degree of the graph.

21
00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:39.210
But perhaps more interesting is the joint
two dimensional histogram of the graph,

22
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.970
the colorful histogram of the graph
can be interpreted here as follows.

23
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.330
The graph has a maximum in degree of
three and a maximum out degree of three.

24
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.644
This creates a two-dimensional
histogram with four times four

25
00:01:52.644 --> 00:01:54.740
equal to 16 different joined values.

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.700
The actual value for any combination
is computed from the graph and

27
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.740
color coded in the ratings.

28
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.890
For example, there is no node with
in degree 0 and out degree 0.

29
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.930
So the lower-left square of the graph
has value zero and color-coded blue.

30
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.580
On the other hand, there are two nodes
with in-degree three and out-degree three.

31
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.510
Thus, the top-right corner has the value
twp, which is 20% of the nodes.

32
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.310
Color coded as light green.

33
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.630
The 2D histogram provides
an interesting insight.

34
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.940
The nodes with more incident
edges than outgoing edges

35
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.740
represent entities that take
in more than they put out.

36
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.090
In a social networking setting,
they represent members who are listeners.

37
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.910
They receive a lot of posts,
but send much fewer posts.

38
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.510
On the opposite side of the spectrum,

39
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.242
there are talkers whose out-degrees
exceed their in-degrees.

40
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.173
The entities that are in between,
we have both large values of in-degree and

41
00:03:06.173 --> 00:03:07.340
out-degree.

42
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.460
These are communicators.

43
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.180
In this graph, there seems to
be more talkers than listeners.

44
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.850
Not surprising though.

45
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.236
My social media friends
show similar statistics.
