1
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.180
We saw how a community
in a graph can evolve.

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.940
To track the nature of evolution,

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.180
we need to measure how
the community changes over time.

4
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.800
So here are three cases.

5
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.670
One, two and three of a community
changing between two observation points.

6
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.060
The goal is to figure out whether these
are normal fluctuations in the network or

7
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.610
are more drastic changes occurring.

8
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.990
Look at them for a second.

9
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.138
Just visually, the first case
seems to show just minor changes.

10
00:00:41.138 --> 00:00:47.770
Whereas case two shows a merger,
and case three shows a split.

11
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.660
Now, to come up with a quantitative
measure of change over time, we need to

12
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.210
take two observations from two consecutive
time points and fuse the graph.

13
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.910
If you do it for case one,
you'll find one new node,

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.870
one living node, and
the rest will come on over time.

15
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.060
For case two, you will see
that two previous communities,

16
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.150
colored differently, are internally
connected the same way as before.

17
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.170
But some members of the two communities
have created new crosslinks.

18
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.520
Now can you tell me what
you observe in case three?

19
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.060
Well I see one join node, color purple.

20
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.470
Apart from it, there are just two
edges connecting the two groups.

21
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.820
Now with these observations,
we can now compute the autocorrelation

22
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.930
between the graphs across time t and
t plus 1.

23
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.770
This is just a measure of
the number of common nodes

24
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.090
divided by the number of
nodes in the combined graph.

25
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.010
If the community does not change at all,
this number is 1.

26
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.860
If a community has only a few connection,
the number is lower.

27
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.360
After computing autocorrelation
over every pair of time steps,

28
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.570
we can then compute stationarity,

29
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.040
which measures the overall change in
the autocorrelation over a period of time.

30
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.300
So if we measure over 100 time steps,

31
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.990
we will add the 99 correlation values
from the steps and then divide it by 99.

32
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.000
This will tell us what fraction
of members remain unchanged

33
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.110
on an average over these 100 time steps.

34
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.380
Therefore, the 1 minus zeta tells
us the average ratio of members

35
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.940
that are changed in a time step.

36
00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:46.060
Let's take three cases.

37
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.010
In the first plot,
the size of the graph is small and

38
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.890
nothing much is happening here.

39
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.180
A note occasionally joins or leaves,
keeping the stationarity pretty flat.

40
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.320
In the second case, the graph is small,
but there are a lot of changes, especially

41
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.710
at time step seven a whole bunch of purple
nodes have joined and then they went away.

42
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.320
The size of the graph
clearly reflects this

43
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.440
with a purple spike that you see
on the size versus the time graph.

44
00:03:21.123 --> 00:03:24.078
This spike on the time series
by the way is called a burst.

45
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:30.640
The third plot shows a large graph
with many nodes joining and leaving.

46
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.683
The stationarity of this graph will be
quite low given the abrupt changes we

47
00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:38.039
observe over time.
