00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.331
In this lecture we'll be learning about
the basic file manipulation commands for

2
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:05.953
the Hadoop File System or HDFS.

3
00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:09.440
We'll first start by downloading
a text file of words.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.040
We'll use this text file to copy to and
from the local file system in HDFS and

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.730
later on we'll use it
to run word count on.

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.960
After we download the text file,
we'll open a terminal shell and

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.220
copy the text file from
the local file system to HDFS.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.870
Next, we'll copy the file within HDFS and

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.880
also see how to copy file from
HDFS to the local file system.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.223
Finally, we'll see how to
delete a file in HDFS.

11
00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.410
Let's start.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.390
We're going to download text
file to copy into HDFS.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.610
It doesn't matter what the contents of
the text file is, so we'll download

14
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.380
the complete works of Shakespeare
since it contains interesting text.

15
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:56.840
First, click on the icon here
to launch a web browser.

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.780
Now we'll search Google for
the complete works of Shakespeare.

17
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.880
I'm going to be using
this first link here.

18
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.500
And we'll provide this link
in the reading section.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.080
So this is the complete
works of Shakespeare and

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.700
we'll save it to a text file in the local
file system by clicking on the icon here,

21
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.790
the Open Menu and selecting save page.

22
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.105
So we'll call it words.txt.

23
00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:52.090
And the Save in folder, it's going to
save it into the Downloads directory.

24
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:02.800
Once that completes, we'll open a terminal
window by clicking on the icon here.

25
00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:13.480
So if we go into the downloads
Ddrectory by typing a cd Downloads and

26
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.320
running ls, we can see that words.txt
was successfully downloaded.

27
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.100
Moving on, let's copy words.txt from the
local file system to the HDFS file system.

28
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.711
The command to do this is hadoop
fs- copyFromLocal words.txt.

29
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.330
When I run this,
it'll copy it from the local directory and

30
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.595
local file system to HDFS.

31
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.681
We can see that the file was
copied by running hadoop fs -ls.

32
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:57.630
You can see that the file
was successfully copied.

33
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.673
Next, we can copy this file
to another file within HDFS.

34
00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:14.170
We can do this by running hadoop
fs -cp words.txt words2.txt.

35
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.500
The first words.txt is the file
that already exists in HDFS.

36
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.760
The second words 2.txt

37
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.230
is the new file that we're going to
create when we run this command.

38
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.182
Let's run it, and again we're can run

39
00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:38.033
hadoopfs-ls to see the files in HDFS.

40
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:44.364
We can see the original file words.txt,
and the copy that was made, words2.txt.

41
00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:52.680
Let's copy words2.txt from
HDFS to the local filesystem.

42
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.909
We can do this by running hadoop
fs -copyToLocal words2.txt.

43
00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:09.210
After I run this command, I can call ls to
see the contents of the local file system.

44
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.455
So now we have the new file words2.txt
which we've just copied from HDFS.

45
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.980
The last step in this lecture
is to delete a file in HDFS.

46
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.881
We can delete words2.txt
by running hadoop fs,

47
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.404
but is rn words2.txt.

48
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.930
As you can see,
it printed that it deleted the file.

49
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.806
We can also run hadoop fs- ls,
to verify that the file is deleted.

50
00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:50.872
You can see that there's only the original
words.txt, and words2.txt was deleted.
