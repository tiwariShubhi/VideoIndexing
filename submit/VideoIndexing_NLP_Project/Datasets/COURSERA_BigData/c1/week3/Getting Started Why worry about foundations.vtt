1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.260
Getting started.

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.310
Why do we worry about foundations?

3
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:19.079
Starting next week you'll start
diving into the details of the Hadoop

4
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.650
framework for big data.

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.460
Before you start, taking a little
bit of time to understand some core

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580
concepts will help you to digest the
information on Hadoop better and faster.

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
Imagine yourself attending
a chemistry lab.

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.700
Before you start hearing about
the tubes and mixtures, you really need

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.650
to understand the chemistry or theory
of the practical concepts in the lab.

10
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.650
Similarly, learning these
concepts now will help

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.880
you with your understanding of the
practical concepts in the Hadoop lectures.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.290
In addition, we want to prepare you to
understand the tools beyond Hadoop.

13
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.410
Any big data system that you find
will be built on these core concepts.

14
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.200
So these foundations will
help you beyond this course.

15
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.460
Now, let's get started.
