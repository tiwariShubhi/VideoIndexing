00:00:01.081 --> 00:00:04.312
Why is Big Data generated
by machines useful?

2
00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:31.997
Let's go back for
a second to our first example for

3
00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.715
machine generated big data planes.

4
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.940
What is producing all
that data on the plane?

5
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.180
If you look at some of
the sensors that contribute

6
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.600
to the half terabyte of
data generated on a plane,

7
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.040
we will find that some of it comes from
accelerometers that measure turbulence.

8
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.393
There are also sensors built into
the engines for temperature, pressure,

9
00:00:58.393 --> 00:01:02.666
many other measurable factors
to detect engine malfunctions.

10
00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:07.487
Constant real-time analysis of all
the data collected provides help

11
00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:11.496
monitoring and
problem detection at 40,000 feet.

12
00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:15.622
That's approximately 12,000
meters above ground.

13
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.210
We call this type of
analytical processing in-situ.

14
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.940
Previously, in traditional relational
database management systems,

15
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.160
data was often moved to
computational space for processing.

16
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.000
In Big Data space In-Situ
means bringing the computation

17
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.865
to where data is located or,
in this case, generated.

18
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.936
A key feature of these types
of real-time notifications is

19
00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:51.090
that they enable real-time actions.

20
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.756
However, using such a capability
would require you to approach your

21
00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:58.580
application and your work differently.

22
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
If you are using an activity tracker, you
should probably come up with a strategy

23
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.540
for how you will incorporate the usage of
these useful gadgets into your lifestyle.

24
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.520
Just like that, if you're planning to
incorporate Big Data driven insights into

25
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.610
your organization, you need to define
a new strategy, and a new way of working.

26
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.184
Most Big Data centric businesses have
updated their culture to be more real-time

27
00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:34.160
action oriented, refining real-time
processes to handle anything from customer

28
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.080
relations and fraud detection,
to system monitoring and control.

29
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.150
In addition, such volumes of real-time
data and analytical operations that need

30
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.880
to take place requires an increased
use of scalable computing systems,

31
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870
which need to be a part of the planning
for an organizational Big Data strategy.

32
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.580
They see affects of such
changes also in SCADA system.

33
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.630
SCADA stands for Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition.

34
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.710
SCADA is a type of industrial control
system for remote monitoring and

35
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.190
control of industrial processes
that exists in the physical world,

36
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.020
potentially including multiple sites,
many types of sensors.

37
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.410
In addition to monitoring and control,
SCADA system can be used to define

38
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.390
actions for reduced waste and improved
efficiency in industrial processes,

39
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.100
including those of manufacturing and
power generation, public or

40
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.820
private infrastructure processes,
including water treatment, oil, and

41
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.040
gas pipelines, and
electrical power transmission, and

42
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.300
facility processes including buildings,
airports, ships, and space stations.

43
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.240
They can even be used in smart
building applications to monitor and

44
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.910
control heating, ventilation,
air conditioning systems like HVAC,

45
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.030
access, and energy consumption.

46
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.040
Again, the management of these processes
once the trends, patterns, and

47
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.460
anomalies are identified in real-time
needs to be decided in the Big Data case.

48
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:26.960
As a summary, as the largest and fastest
type of Big Data, machine generated

49
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.690
data can uniquely enable real-time
actions in many systems and processes.

50
00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.198
However, a culture shift is needed for
its computing and real-time action.
