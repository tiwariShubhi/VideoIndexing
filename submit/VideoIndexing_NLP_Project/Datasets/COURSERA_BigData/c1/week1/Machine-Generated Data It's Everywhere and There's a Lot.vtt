00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.630
Big data generated by machines.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.508
It's everywhere and there's a lot.

3
00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:19.120
Do big planes require big data?

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.650
Absolutely!

5
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.770
Did you know that a Boeing 787 produces

6
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.450
half a terabyte of data
every time it flies?

7
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.680
Really, almost every part of
the plane updates both the flight and

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.990
the ground team about
its status constantly.

9
00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:38.530
Where's all this data coming from?

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.360
This is an example of machine-generated
data coming from sensors.

11
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
If you look at all sources of big data,

12
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.470
machine data is the largest
source of big data.

13
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.850
Additionally, it is very complex.

14
00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.960
In general, we call machines that provide
some type of sensing capability smart.

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.760
Have you ever wondered why you
call your cell phone a smartphone?

16
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.790
Because it gives you a way
to track many things,

17
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.740
including your geolocation, and
connect you to other things.

18
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.716
So what makes a smart device smart, smart?

19
00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:22.110
Generally speaking, There are three
main properties of smart devices

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.200
based on what they do with sensors and
things they encapsulate.

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.480
They can connect to other devices or

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.490
networks, they can execute services and
collect data autonomously,

23
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.230
that means on their own, they have
some knowledge of the environment.

24
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.940
The widespread availability of the smart
devices and their interconnectivity

25
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.080
led to a new term being coined,
The Internet of Things.

26
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.450
Think of a world of smart devices at home,
in your car, in the office,

27
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.110
city, remote rural areas,
the sky, even the ocean,

28
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.340
all connected and all generating data.

29
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
Let's look at an example of a device
that has some of these things in it.

30
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.930
An activity tracker is a device or
application for monitoring and

31
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.790
tracking fitness-related metrics
such as distance walked or run,

32
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.670
calorie consumption, and in some cases,
heartbeat and quality of sleep.

33
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
What if everyone in New York City
wore an activity tracker?

34
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.350
What if everyone wore several?

35
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.300
I personally have three activity
trackers that I use on a daily basis.

36
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.200
One to track my sleep, another one
to track my physical activity, and

37
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.250
a third, my smartphone,
that goes everywhere with me.

38
00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.030
So it is not that unusual to imagine that
this will be the case for many people.

39
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.320
As you have already heard from in
a previous lecture on personalized data,

40
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.760
such activity trackers
have enabled a new way

41
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.210
of doing patient intervention
via personalized medicine.

42
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.440
Similarly, the sensors in planes have
generated a new way of looking at

43
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.370
fleet management and flight safety.

44
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.055
As a summary,
machines collect data 24/7 via

45
00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:31.980
their built-in sensors,
both at personal and industrial scales.

46
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.308
And thus, they are the largest
of all the big data sources.
