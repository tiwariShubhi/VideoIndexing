00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.380
What launched the big data era?

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.092
In this video, you will learn about
two new opportunities that have

3
00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:12.088
contributed to the launch
of the big data era.

4
00:00:27.737 --> 00:00:32.070
Opportunities are often
a signal of changing times.

5
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.100
In 2013, an influential report by
a company called McKinsey claimed that

6
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.900
the area of data science will be the
number one catalyst for economic growth.

7
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.320
McKinsey identified one of our new

8
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.366
opportunities that contributed to
the launch of the big data era.

9
00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:59.190
A growing torrent of data.

10
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.150
This refers to the idea that data seems to
be coming continuously and at a fast rate.

11
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.330
Think about this,
today you can buy a hard drive to store

12
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.624
all the music in the world for only $600.

13
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.600
That's an amazing storage capability over
any previous forms of music storage.

14
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.286
In 2010 there were 5 billion
mobile phones in use.

15
00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:33.018
You can be sure that
there are more today and

16
00:01:33.018 --> 00:01:37.476
as I'm sure you will understand,
these phones and

17
00:01:37.476 --> 00:01:42.244
the apps we install on them
are a big source of big data,

18
00:01:42.244 --> 00:01:47.342
which all the time, every day,
contributes to our core.

19
00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:50.444
And Facebook, which recently just set

20
00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:55.144
a record of having one billion
people login in a single day,

21
00:01:55.144 --> 00:02:00.320
has more that 30 billion pieces
of content shared every month.

22
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.620
Well, that number's from 2013.

23
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.310
So I'm sure that it's much
higher than that now.

24
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.950
Does it make you think how many
Facebook share's you made last month?

25
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.105
All this leads to projections
of serious growth.

26
00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:24.860
40% in global data per year,
and 5% in global IT spending.

27
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.080
This much data has sure
pushed the data science field

28
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.420
to start remaining itself and
the business world of today.

29
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.970
But, there's something else contributing
to the catalyzing power of data science.

30
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.820
It is called cloud computing.

31
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.600
We call this on demand computing.

32
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.480
Cloud computing is one of
the ways in which computing

33
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.220
has now become something that
we ca do anytime, and anywhere.

34
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.170
You may be surprised to know
that some of your favorite

35
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.900
apps are from businesses
being run from coffee shops.

36
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.420
This new ability,
combined with our torrent of data,

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.220
gives us the opportunity to perform novel,
dynamic and scalable data analysis,

38
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.824
to tell us new things about our world and
ourself.

39
00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:20.037
To summarize, a new torrent of big data
combined with computing capability

40
00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:25.968
anytime, anywhere has been at the core
of the launch of the big data era.
