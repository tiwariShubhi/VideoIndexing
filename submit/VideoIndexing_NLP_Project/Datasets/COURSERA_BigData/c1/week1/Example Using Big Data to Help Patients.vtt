1
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.840
Let's look at a 2nd example where big data
can have a big impact on saving lives.

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.428
I mean,
literally saving lives one life at a time.

3
00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:14.508
I collaborated with a number of
world-class researchers in San Diego, and

4
00:00:14.508 --> 00:00:18.911
an industrial group who are dedicated to
improving human health through research

5
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:20.970
and practice of precision medicine.

6
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.250
What is precision medicine?

7
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.950
It is an emerging area of medicine
targeted toward an individual person.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.910
Analysing her genetics, her environment,
her daily activities so

9
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.880
that one can detect or
predict a health problem early,

10
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.570
help prevent disease and
in case of illness provide the right drug

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.690
at the right dose that is
suitable just for her.

12
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.587
Very recently the White House and
the National Institute of Health here

13
00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:56.401
in the U.S. have declared it to be
a top priority area for research and

14
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:58.779
development for the next decade.

15
00:00:58.779 --> 00:01:01.689
The expected learning
outcome of this video is for

16
00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:04.668
you to give example of sensor,
organizational and

17
00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.870
people-generated data used
in precision medicine.

18
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.650
And, explain why the integration of
different kinds of data is critical

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.940
in advancing healthcare.

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.000
For any technology to
succeed in real life we need

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.940
not only a certain level of maturity of
the technology itself, but a number of

22
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.050
enabling factors including social
economic environment, market demands,

23
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.860
consumer readiness, cost effectiveness,
all of which must work together.

24
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.790
Why is big data for
precision medicine important now?

25
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.290
Let's see.

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.900
An important aspect of precision
medicine is to utilize

27
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.570
an individual's genetic profile for
his or her own diagnoses and treatment.

28
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.630
Analyzing the human genome,

29
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.670
which holds the key to human health
is rapidly becoming more affordable.

30
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.110
Today's cost to sequence a genome is less

31
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.760
than 10% of what it
cost just back in 2008.

32
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.070
But, human genomic data is big.

33
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.390
How big?

34
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.660
In a perfect world, just the three
billion letters of your genome

35
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.220
would require about 700
megabytes to store.

36
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.280
In the real world, meaning the kind of
data generated from genome sequencing

37
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.540
machines, we need 200GB to store a genome.

38
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.700
And it takes now about
a day to sequence a genome.

39
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.520
We are finally beginning to create more
electronic records that can be stored and

40
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.130
manipulated in digital media.

41
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.180
Most doctors offices and hospitals now
use electronic health record systems

42
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.130
which contain all details of
a patient's visit and lab test.

43
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.290
How big is this data?

44
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.710
As a quick example The Samaritan Medical
Center Watertown New York at 294 that

45
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.690
Community Hospital reported
120 terabytes as of 2013.

46
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.490
The data value more than double
in just the last two years.

47
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.860
So clearly just in a past two years
dramatic changes have prepared the health

48
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.920
care industry to produce and analyze
larger mounts of complex patient data.

49
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.570
To summarize what we have seen so far
the key components of these changes are:

50
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.460
Reduced cost of data generation and
analysis, increased availability of cheap

51
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.430
large data storage, and they increased
digitization of previously paper records.

52
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.560
But we need one more capability to advance
toward the promised land of individualized

53
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.410
health care practices.

54
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.420
We need to combine various types of
data produce by different groups in

55
00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.130
a meaningful way.

56
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.150
Let's look at this issue from
the same point of view as Ilka did.

57
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.760
With her discussion of how big data
can help with wildfire analytics.

58
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.980
The key is the integration of
multiple types of data sources.

59
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.130
Data from sensors,
organizations and people.

60
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.200
In the next few slides,
we look at each of these, and

61
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.820
then I'll share a story about some of the
new and really exciting ways people data

62
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.660
especially has the potential to
change healthcare big data landscape.

63
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.320
Let's start with sensor data.

64
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.000
Sure, digital hospital equipment
have been producing sensor data for

65
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.720
years, but it was unlikely that
the data was ever stored or

66
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.790
shared, let alone
analyzed retrospectively.

67
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.025
These were intended for

68
00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:45.880
real-time use, to inform healthcare
professionals, and then got discarded.

69
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.320
Now we have many more sensors and
deployment.

70
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.850
And many more places
that are capturing and

71
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.970
explicitly gathering information
to be stored and analyzed.

72
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.970
Let's just take a new kind of data

73
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.720
that's increasingly becoming
common in our daily lives.

74
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.600
Fitness devices are everywhere now

75
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.320
their sales have skyrocketed
in the last few years.

76
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.360
They are in wristbands, watches, shoes and
vests, directly communicating with your

77
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.160
personal mobile device, tracking several
activity variables like blood pressure,

78
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.080
different types of activities,
blood glucose levels, etc at every moment.

79
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.850
Their goal is to improve wellness.

80
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.080
By having you monitor
your daily status and

81
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.410
hopefully improve your
lifestyle to stay healthy.

82
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.080
But the data they generate can be
very useful medical information

83
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.100
because this data is about what
happens in your normal life and

84
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.700
not just when you go to the doctor.

85
00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.660
How much data do they generate?

86
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.890
The device called FitBit can
produce several gigabytes a day.

87
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.900
Could this data be used to save healthcare
costs, effect a healthier lifestyle?

88
00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.660
That's a question mark.

89
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.660
It's safe to guess that this data
alone wouldn't drive the dream of

90
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.350
precision medicine.

91
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.290
But what if we consider integrating
it with other sources of data

92
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.060
like electronic health records or
a genomic profile?

93
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.310
This remains an open question.

94
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.460
This is an open arena for research that
my colleagues at scripts are doing.

95
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.090
It's also a potentially significant area
for product and business development.

96
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.480
Let's look at some examples of health
related data being generated by

97
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.120
organizations.

98
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.380
Many public databases
including those curated and

99
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.690
managed by NCBI, the National Center for
Biotechnology Information,

100
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.180
had been created to capture the basic
scientific data and knowledge for

101
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.090
humans and other model organisms at
the different building blocks of life.

102
00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:53.220
These databases carry both experimental
and computed data that are necessary to

103
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.193
observations for
unconquered diseases like cancer.

104
00:06:56.193 --> 00:07:00.730
In addition,
many have created knoweledge-bases

105
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.500
like the Geneontology and
The Unified Medical Language System

106
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.050
to assemble human knowledge in
a machine processable form.

107
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.660
These are just a few examples of
organizational data sources and

108
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.040
governmental data gathered by health
care systems around the world

109
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.050
could also be used as a massive
source of information.

110
00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.210
But really some of
the most interesting and

111
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:27.040
novel opportunities seem likely to come
from the area of people generated data.

112
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.450
Mobile healths apps is an area
that is growing significantly.

113
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.720
There are apps now to monitor heart rates,
blood pressure, and

114
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.310
test oxygen saturation levels.

115
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.630
Apps, we might say,
record data from sensors but

116
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.040
are also obviously generated from people.

117
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.160
But there is more people generated
data that's interesting beyond censure

118
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.120
measurements.

119
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.280
In 2015 the Webby People's Voice Award

120
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.310
went to an app which supports
meditation and mindfulness.

121
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.400
Rather than an electronic sensing device,

122
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.259
a human would indicate how many
minutes per day they spent meditating.

123
00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.078
If they interact with the app
which reminds them to be mindful,

124
00:08:11.078 --> 00:08:15.630
then we have human generated behavior
that we couldn't get from a sensor.

125
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.510
There are well over 100,000 health apps
today in either iTunes or Google Play.

126
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.710
And by some estimates
the Mobile Health App market

127
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.064
may be worth 27 billion dollars by 2017.

128
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:35.500
So really we are just seen the beginning
of what data might be generated here

129
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.490
from what's being called human sensors,
but to really understand where the power

130
00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.980
of people generated data might take us
in the era of big data for healthcare.

131
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.360
Let's imagine how things stand now.

132
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.660
In general,
a patient goes to see their doctor and

133
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:55.960
maybe their doctor asks if they have had
any side effects from their medications.

134
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.430
The accuracy and

135
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:02.470
hence the quality of data patients provide
in this kind of setting is very low.

136
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.170
Not that it's really the patients fault.

137
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.930
It might have been days or
weeks ago that they experienced something.

138
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.760
They may be unsure whether something
they experienced was actually a reaction

139
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.380
to then report it.

140
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.590
And there might be details about exactly
when they took a medication that

141
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.790
are meaningful, but
they've forgotten it after the fact.

142
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.120
Today, people are self reporting reactions
and experiences they are having.

143
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:32.540
We're on Twitter, on blog sites,
online support groups,

144
00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:37.030
online data sharing services: these
are sources of data that we've

145
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:41.660
never had before that can be used to
understand in a far more detailed and

146
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.360
personal rate the impact of drug
integrations are responses to certain

147
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.430
If applications were designed
to integrate doctor and

148
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:55.040
hospital records with information
on when drugs were taken and

149
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.000
then to further mine social media or
collect self reports from patients.

150
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.230
Who knows what kinds of questions
we will be able to answer?

151
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.008
Or new questions we may be able to ask?
