00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.830
Where does big data come from?

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.720
The first thing I would like to
say before talking about big data

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.010
is that it is not new.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.600
Most of the big data sources existed
before, but the scale we use and

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.020
apply them today has changed.

6
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.590
Just look at this image of open
link data on the Internet.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.740
I thought this image was so cool.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.350
It shows not only there are so
many sources of data, but

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.490
they're also connected.

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.147
If you want to check it out yourself,

11
00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:35.408
we'll give you the link
at the end of this video.

12
00:00:35.408 --> 00:00:40.859
Big data is often boiled down to a few
varieties of data generated by machines,

13
00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.010
people, and organizations.

14
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.057
With machine generated data we refer to
data generated from real time sensors in

15
00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:54.029
industrial machinery or vehicles that
logs that track user behavior online,

16
00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:55.687
environmental sensors or

17
00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:59.930
personal health trackers, and
many other sense data resources.

18
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.560
The Large Hadron Collider
generates 40 terabytes of data

19
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.560
every second during experiments.

20
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.078
But human generated data, we refer to
the vast amount of social media data,

21
00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:18.420
status updates, tweets,
photos, and medias.

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.943
With organizational generated data we
refer to more traditional types of data,

23
00:01:23.943 --> 00:01:27.598
including transaction
information in databases and

24
00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:31.026
structured data open
stored in data warehouses.

25
00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:35.437
Note that big data can be either
structured, semi-structured, or

26
00:01:35.437 --> 00:01:40.390
unstructured, which is a topic we will
talk about more later in this course.

27
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.180
In most business use cases, any single
source of data on its own is not useful.

28
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.880
Real value often comes from combining
these streams of big data sources

29
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.210
with each other and
analyzing them to generate new insights,

30
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.430
which then goes back into
being big data themselves.

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.870
Once you have such insights,

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.320
it then enables what we call data
enabled decisions and actions.

33
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.858
Let's now look into these different
types of big data in more detail.
