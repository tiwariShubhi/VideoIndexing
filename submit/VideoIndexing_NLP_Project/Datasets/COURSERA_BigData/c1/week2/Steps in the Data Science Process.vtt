00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.545
Steps in the Data Science Process.

2
00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:16.739
We have already seen a simple linear
form of data science process,

3
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:21.900
including five distinct activities
that depend on each other.

4
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.095
Let's summarize each activity further
before we go into the details of each.

5
00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:34.617
Acquire includes anything that makes
us retrieve data including; finding,

6
00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:39.210
accessing, acquiring, and moving data.

7
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.640
It includes identification of and
authenticated access to all related data.

8
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.000
And transportation of data from
sources to distributed files systems.

9
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.340
It includes way to subset and match
the data to regions or times of interest.

10
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.830
As we sometimes refer to
it as geo-spacial query.

11
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.010
The next activity is prepare data,
we divide the pre-data activity.

12
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.574
Into two steps based on
the nature of the activity.

13
00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:16.990
Namely, explore data and pre-process data.

14
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.890
The first step in data preparation
involves literally looking

15
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.750
at the data to understand its nature,
what it means, its quality and format.

16
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.320
It often takes a preliminary
analysis of data, or

17
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230
samples of data, to understand it.

18
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.230
This is why this step is called explore.

19
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.100
Once we know more about the data
through exploratory analysis,

20
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.625
the next step is pre-processing
of data for analysis.

21
00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:52.180
Pre-processing includes cleaning data,
sub-setting or

22
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.660
filtering data, creating data,
which programs can read and

23
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.660
understand, such as modeling raw
data into a more defined data model,

24
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.260
or packaging it using
a specific data format.

25
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.630
If there are multiple data sets involved,

26
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.300
this step also includes integration
of multiple data sources, or streams.

27
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.070
The prepared data then would be
passed onto the analysis step,

28
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.590
which involves selection of
analytical techniques to use,

29
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.190
building a model of the data,
and analyzing results.

30
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.120
This step can take a couple
of iterations on its own or

31
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.180
might require data scientists
to go back to steps one and

32
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.350
two to get more data or
package data in a different way.

33
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.070
Step four for communicating results
includes evaluation of analytical results.

34
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.400
Presenting them in a visual way,
creating reports that include

35
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.080
an assessment of results with
respect to success criteria.

36
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.690
Activities in this step can often be
referred to with terms like interpret,

37
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.780
summarize, visualize, or post process.

38
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.390
The last step brings us back to the very
first reason we do data science,

39
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.240
the purpose.

40
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.470
Reporting insights from analysis and
determining actions from insights based

41
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.300
on the purpose you initially defined
is what we refer to as the act step.

42
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.010
We have now seen all the steps in
a typical data science process.

43
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.320
Please note that this is an iterative
process and findings from one step

44
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.970
may require the previous step to
be repeated with new information.
