00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.922
Step 5, Act, turning insights into action.

2
00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:20.048
Now that you have evaluated
the results from your analysis and

3
00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:25.329
generated reports on the potential value
of the results, the next step is to

4
00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:31.075
determine what action or actions should
be taken, based on the insights gained?

5
00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.290
Remember why we started
bringing together the data and

6
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.570
analyzing it in the first place?

7
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.100
To find actionable insights
within all these data sets,

8
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.970
to answer questions, or for
improving business processes.

9
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.470
For example,

10
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.440
is there something in your process that
should change to remove bottle necks?

11
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.640
Is there data that should be added to your
application to make it more accurate?

12
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.440
Should you segment your population
into more well defined groups for

13
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.240
more effective targeted marketing?

14
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.508
This is the first step in
turning insights into action.

15
00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:12.733
Now that you've determined
what action to take,

16
00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:17.450
the next step is figuring out
how to implement the action.

17
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.610
What is necessary to add this action
into your process or application?

18
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.080
How should it be automated?

19
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.110
The stakeholders need to be identified and
become involved in this change.

20
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.090
Just as with any process improvement
changes, we need to monitor and

21
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.020
measure the impact of the action
on the process or application.

22
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.600
Assessing the impact
leads to an evaluation.

23
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.710
Evaluating results from the implemented
action will determine your next steps.

24
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.640
Is there additional analysis that need
to be performed in order to yield

25
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.730
even better results?

26
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.740
What data should be revisited?

27
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.980
Are there additional opportunities
that should be explored?

28
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.685
For example, let's not forget
what big data enables us to do.

29
00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:16.553
Real-time actions based on high
velocity streaming information.

30
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:21.067
We need to define what part of our
business needs real-time action to be

31
00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:25.670
able to influence the operations or
the interaction with the customer.

32
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.430
Once we define these real time actions,
we need to make sure that

33
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.080
there are automated systems, or
processes to perform such actions, and

34
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.320
provide failure recovery
in case of problems.

35
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.547
As a summary, big data and

36
00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:49.320
data science are only useful if
the insights can be turned into action,

37
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.198
and if the actions are carefully
defined and evaluated.
