00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.990
We've looked at classification,
regression and cluster analysis.

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.280
Let's now discuss association
analysis as a machine learning task.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.100
After this video, you will be able to
explain what association analysis entails,

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.259
list some applications of association
analysis, define what an item set is.

5
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.600
In association analysis, the goal is to
come up with a set of rules to capture

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.070
associations between items or events.

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.870
The rules are used to determine when
items or events occur together.

8
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.110
You may remember seeing these images
earlier in the course, where we introduced

9
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.730
the different categories of machine
learning tasks and techniques.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.580
But do you remember what
the association is between these items?

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.810
Well, let's recap that story,
in case you don't remember.

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.380
The story goes like this.

13
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.100
A supermarket chain used
association analysis to discover

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.050
a connection between two
seemingly unrelated products.

15
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.200
They discovered that many
customers who go to the store

16
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.860
late on Sunday night to buy
diapers also tend to buy beer.

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.634
This information was then used to
place beer and diapers close together.

18
00:01:09.634 --> 00:01:12.780
And they saw a jump in
sales of both items.

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.620
This illustrates that you
can uncover unexpected and

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.040
useful relationships with
association analysis.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.530
This diaper and beer story has become
part of the data mining folklore.

22
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.650
It's unclear how much of it true, but it
has become the prime example of what you

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.600
can discover with association analysis and
machine learning in general.

24
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.511
A common application of association
analysis is referred to as

25
00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:39.398
market basket analysis.

26
00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:43.550
This is used to understand
the purchasing behavior of customers.

27
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.190
The idea is that you're looking into
the shopping basket of customers

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.650
when they are at the market, and

29
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.150
analyzing that data to understand
what items are purchased together.

30
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.090
This information can be used to
place related items together, or

31
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.290
to have sales on items that
are often purchased together.

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.210
Another application of association
analysis is to recommend items that

33
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.620
a customer may be interested in, based
on their purchasing or browsing history.

34
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.720
This is very commonly used
on companies' websites

35
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.379
to get customers to buy more items.

36
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.610
There are medical applications as well.

37
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.430
Analysis of patients and treatments may
reveal associations to identify effective

38
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.080
treatments for
patients with certain medical histories.

39
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.710
this diagram illustrates how
association analysis works.

40
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.090
The data set is a collection
of transactions.

41
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.519
Each transaction contains one or
more items.

42
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.490
This is referred to as the item set.

43
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.070
From the given items sets,

44
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.250
generate association rules that capture
which item tend occur together.

45
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.520
In our example, the data set
consists of five transactions.

46
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.518
In the first transaction,
the items are diaper, bread and milk.

47
00:02:56.518 --> 00:03:01.900
The second transaction has items bread,
diaper, beer, and eggs, and so on.

48
00:03:03.258 --> 00:03:07.290
Rules that could be generated from
this data set are shown at the bottom.

49
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.090
For example,
the first rule states that if bread and

50
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.910
milk are bought together,
then diaper is also bought.

51
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.870
The second rule state that if milk is
bought, then bread is also bought.

52
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.690
The association analysis process
consist of the following steps.

53
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.140
The first step is to create item sets.

54
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.690
Item sets are generated for sets with one
item, two items, three items and so on.

55
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.300
Then frequent item sets are identified.

56
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.380
Frequent item sets are those that occur
at least a minimum number of times.

57
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.580
From the frequent item sets,
association rules are generated.

58
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.310
We will take a more detailed look
at these steps in the next lecture.

59
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.800
Some things to note about
association analysis.

60
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.480
Like cluster analysis, each transaction
does not have a label to specify which

61
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.760
item set or rule it belongs to.

62
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.340
So, association analysis
is an unsupervised task.

63
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.510
You may end up with many rules
at the end of the analysis.

64
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.540
But, whether those rules are interesting,
useful,

65
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.370
or applicable, requires interpretation
using domain knowledge of the application.

66
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.720
In addition,

67
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.200
the association analysis process will
not tell you how to apply the rules.

68
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.999
This also requires knowledge
of the application.

69
00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.245
So as with cluster analysis,
interpretation and analysis are required

70
00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:34.780
to make sense of the resulting rules
that you get from association analysis.

71
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.020
In summary,

72
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.240
association analysis finds rules to
capture associations between items.

73
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.670
The association rules have intuitive
appeal because they are in the form of

74
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.420
if this, then that,
which is easy to understand.

75
00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.150
The results of association
analysis require analysis and

76
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.430
interpretation using domain knowledge
to determine the usefulness and

77
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.020
applicability of the resulting rules.

78
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.756
Next we will cover the steps in
the association analysis process in

79
00:05:04.756 --> 00:05:05.501
more detail.
