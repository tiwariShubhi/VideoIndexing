00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:05.239
Welcome to course four of
the big data specialization.

2
00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:10.926
I'm Ilkay Altintas, for the new learners
I'm the Chief Data Science Officer

3
00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:17.059
at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at
the University of California, San Diego.

4
00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:21.317
I feel honored to teach you
the basics of big data modeling,

5
00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:25.170
management, and
analysis in this specialization.

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.544
And to work with Dr.
Mai Nguyen on this class.

7
00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:33.270
>> And I'm Mai Nguyen, while most of
you might be familiar with Ilkay,

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.915
I'm a new face.

9
00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:39.010
I'm excited to be here to teach you
what I love doing, machine learning.

10
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.330
I received my PhD in computer science
with a focus on machine learning

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.240
from the University of
California in San Diego.

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.390
Since then,
I have worked as a data scientist,

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.550
and instructor of machine
learning in various venues.

14
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.580
I am the Lead for Data Analytics at SDFC.

15
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.770
In this role, I work on data
science projects doing research

16
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.480
on scalability on machine
learning methods to big data.

17
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
>> We are really happy to have you in this
course to develop your understanding and

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060
skills in machine learning.

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.060
>> And
give you an introductory level experience

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.500
with application of machine
learning to big data.

21
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.410
By now you might have just finished
our first three courses and

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.250
learned the basics of big data modeling,
management, integration, and processing.

23
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.990
If you haven't, it's not required.

24
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.320
But for those with less background
in big data management and

25
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.650
systems, you might find it valuable.

26
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.590
>> We understand that you may
not even have heard anything on

27
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.090
machine learning yet.

28
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.230
That's why we will start by
discussing what machine learning is.

29
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.330
Describing some sample applications and
presenting the typical process

30
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.500
of a machine learning project to give
you a sense of what machine learning is.

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.210
Then we will delve into some
commonly used machine learning

32
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.310
techniques like classification and
clustering.

33
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.630
>> We are also going to show you how
to explore your data, prepare it for

34
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.900
analysis, and evaluate the results you
get with your machine learning model.

35
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.440
These are all necessary steps for
a successful machine learning solution.

36
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.980
>> As you know, for
many data science applications

37
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.210
one has to use many different tools and
methods to analyze data.

38
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
In fact, keeping up with the rapid
development of new tools is

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.190
one of the challenges of
today's big data environment.

40
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.870
In this course, we will introduce you to
two different types of machine learning

41
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.470
tools namely Nime and Spark MNL.

42
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.320
Nime is a graphical user interface based
tool that requires no programming.

43
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.370
And as representative of
a set of tools used in visual

44
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.810
workflow approach to machine learning.

45
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.784
You will have hand on practice with
Nime as you go through the exercises in

46
00:02:49.784 --> 00:02:50.380
this course.

47
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.260
We are also excited to show you
examples of data processing

48
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.229
using Sparks Machine Learning library and
OwlWeb.

49
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.770
Our goal here is to provide you

50
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.840
with simple hands-on exercises that
require introductory level programming,

51
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.930
to inspire you on how big data machine
learning tools can be operated.

52
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.390
We wish you a fun time learning and

53
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.420
hope to hear from you in the discussion
forums and learner stories as always.

54
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.590
>> We have suggested time estimates
each week for the course.

55
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.990
But feel free to take the course
at a faster or slower pace.

56
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.920
And don't forget to connect to other
learners through the forums to

57
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.000
enhance your learning experience.

58
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.800
>> Happy learning.

59
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.711
>> Happy learning.
