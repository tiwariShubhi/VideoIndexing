00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.610
What are the steps in
the Machine Learning Process?

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.180
We will discuss those in this lecture.

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.500
After this video, you will be able
to identify the steps in the machine

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.390
learning process and discuss why
the machine learning process is iterative.

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.400
This diagram illustrates the steps
in the machine learning process.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.800
In this lecture,
we will cover an overview of these steps.

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.640
In the next lecture,
we will cover each step in more detail.

8
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.040
It should be kept in mind that all of
these steps need to be carried out with

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.130
a clear purpose in mind.

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.440
That is, the problem or opportunity that
is being addressed must be defined with

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.220
clearly stated goals and objectives.

12
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.150
For example,

13
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.590
the purpose of a project may be to study
customer purchasing behavior to come up

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.850
with a more effective marketing strategy
in order to increase sales revenue.

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.420
The purpose behind the project will
drive the machine learning process.

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.690
The first step in the machine
learning process is to get

17
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.020
all available data related
to the problem at hand.

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.450
Here, we need to identify all data
sources, collect the data, and

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.800
finally integrate data from
these multiple sources.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.070
The next step in the machine learning
process is to prepare the data.

21
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.920
This step is further divided into two
parts, explore data and pre-process data.

22
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.550
The first part of data preparation
involves preliminary exploration

23
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.300
of the data to understand the nature
of the data that we have to work with.

24
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.780
Things we want to understand about
the data are its characteristics, format,

25
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.300
and quality.

26
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.310
A good understanding of the data
leads to a more informed analysis and

27
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.650
a more successful outcome.

28
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.140
Once we know more about the data
through exploratory analysis,

29
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.240
the next part is pre-processing
of the data for analysis.

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.500
This includes cleaning data,
selecting the variables to use, and

31
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.140
transforming data to make the data more
suitable for analysis in the next step.

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.705
The prepared data then would be
passed on to the analysis step.

33
00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:10.280
This step involves selecting
the analytical techniques to use,

34
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.350
building a model using the data,
and assessing the results.

35
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.930
Step four in the machine learning
process it to communicate results.

36
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.490
This includes evaluating the results with
respect to the goal set for the project.

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.360
presenting the results in
a easy to understand way and

38
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.058
communicating the results to others.

39
00:02:28.058 --> 00:02:32.320
The last step is to apply the results.

40
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.550
This brings us back to
the purpose of the project.

41
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.185
How can the insights from our analysis
be used to provide effective marketing

42
00:02:40.185 --> 00:02:41.907
to increase sales revenue?

43
00:02:41.907 --> 00:02:45.039
Determining actions from insights gained

44
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.524
from analysis is the main
focus of the act step.

45
00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:52.480
Note that the machine learning
process is a very iterative one.

46
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.960
Findings from one step may require
a previous step to be repeated

47
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.650
with new information.

48
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.170
For example, during the prepare step, we
may find some data quality issues that may

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.760
require us to go back to the acquire
step to address some issues with data

50
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.550
collection or to get additional data that
we didn't include in the first go around.

51
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.810
Each step may also require
several iterations.

52
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.260
For example, it is common to try different
analysis techniques in the analyze step

53
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.470
in order to get reasonable
results from the model.

54
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.540
So, it is important to recognize that
this is a highly iterative process, and

55
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.320
not a linear one.
