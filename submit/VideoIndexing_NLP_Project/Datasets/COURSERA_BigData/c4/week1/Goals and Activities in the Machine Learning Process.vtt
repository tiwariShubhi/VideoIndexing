00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.360
In this lecture,
we will review each of the steps in

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.440
the machine learning
process in greater detail.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.360
After this video, you will be able
to explain the goals of each step in

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.989
the machine learning process, and list key
activities in each step in the process.

5
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.840
This is the machine learning process
that we saw in the last lecture.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560
In this lecture,
we will cover each step in more detail.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.640
We will describe the goals
of each step and

8
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.600
the key activities performed in each step.

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.870
The first step in the data science
process is to acquire the data.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.910
The goal of the step is to identify and

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.270
obtain all data related
to the problem at hand.

12
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.800
First, we need to identify all
related data and the sources.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.330
Keep in mind, that data can come from
different sources such as files,

14
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.940
databases, the internet, mobile devices.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.290
So remember to include all data related
to the problem you're addressing.

16
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
After you've identified your data and
data sources,

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.360
the next step is to collect the data and
integrate data from the different sources.

18
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.570
This may require conversion,
as data can come in different formats.

19
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.246
And it may also require aligning the data,

20
00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:19.520
as data from different sources may have
different time or spacial resolutions.

21
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.410
Once youâ€™ve collected and integrated your
data, you now have a coherent data set for

22
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.050
your analysis.

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.400
The next step after acquiring data is
to prepare it to make it suitable for

24
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.690
analysis.

25
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.290
There are two parts to this step,
explore data and preprocess data.

26
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.410
We will discuss data exploration first.

27
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.670
In data exploration, you want to
do some preliminary investigation

28
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.680
in order to gain a better understanding of
the specific characteristics of your data.

29
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.779
This in turn will guide
the rest of the process.

30
00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:58.640
With data exploration,
you'll want to look for

31
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.250
things like correlations,
general trends, outliers, etc.

32
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.930
Correlations provide information
about the relationship

33
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.280
between variables in your data.

34
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.710
Trends in your data will reveal if the
variable is moving in a certain direction,

35
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.480
such as transaction volume
increasing throughout the year.

36
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.660
Outliers indicate potential
problems with the data, or

37
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.850
may indicate an interesting data
point that needs further examination.

38
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.680
Without this data exploration activity,

39
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.370
you will not be able to
use your data effectively.

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.680
One way to explore your data is
to calculate summary statistics

41
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.290
to numerically describe the data.

42
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.570
Summary statistics are quantities
that capture various characteristics

43
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.390
of a set of values with a single number,
or a small set of numbers.

44
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.400
Some basic summary statistics that you
should compute for your data set are mean,

45
00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.360
median, mode, range and
standard deviation.

46
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
Mean and median are measures of
the location of a set of values.

47
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.440
Mode is the value that occurs most
frequently in your data set, and

48
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.630
range and standard deviation
are measures of spread in your data.

49
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.060
Looking at these measures will give you
an idea of the nature of your data.

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.130
They can tell you if there's
something wrong with your data.

51
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.100
For example, if the range of
the values for age in your data

52
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.020
includes negative numbers, or
a number much greater than a hundred,

53
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.830
there's something suspicious in
the data that needs to be examined.

54
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.230
Visualization techniques
also provide quick and

55
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.570
effective ways to explore your data.

56
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.760
Some examples are, a histogram,

57
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.570
such as the plot shown here,
shows the distribution of the data and

58
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.269
can show skewness or
unusual dispersion in outliers.

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.380
A line plot, like the one in the lower
left, can be used to look at trends in

60
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.080
the data, such as,
the change in the price of a stock.

61
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.816
A heat map can give you an idea
of where the hot spots are.

62
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:07.315
A scatter plot effectively shows
correlation between two variables.

63
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.585
Overall, there are many types
of plots to visualize data.

64
00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:13.525
They are very useful in helping
you understand the data you have.

65
00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:19.155
The second part of the prepare
step is preprocess.

66
00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.755
So, after we've explored the data, we need
to preprocess the data to prepare it for

67
00:04:23.755 --> 00:04:24.405
analysis.

68
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.950
The goal here is to create the data
that will be used for analysis.

69
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.280
The main activities on this
part are to clean the data,

70
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.070
select the appropriate variables to
use and transform the data as needed.

71
00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.375
A very important part of
data preparation is to

72
00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.975
clean the data to address quality issues.

73
00:04:43.975 --> 00:04:45.875
Real world data is nothing.

74
00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:51.275
There are many examples of quality issues
with data from real applications including

75
00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:56.065
missing values, such as income
in a survey, duplicate data,

76
00:04:56.065 --> 00:04:59.615
such as two different records for the same
customer with different addresses.

77
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.670
Inconsistent or invalid data,
such as a six digit zip code.

78
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.110
Noise in the collection of data
that distorts the true values.

79
00:05:10.915 --> 00:05:15.180
Outliers, such as a number much
larger than 100 for someone's age.

80
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.700
It is essential to detect and

81
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.230
address these issues that can negatively
affect the quality of the data.

82
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.620
Other activities in data preprocessing
can be broadly categorized as

83
00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.140
feature selection and
feature transformation.

84
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.410
Feature selection refers to
choosing the set of features to

85
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.500
use that is appropriate for
the application.

86
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.820
Feature selection can
involve removing redundant or

87
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.420
irrelevant features, combining features,
or creating new features.

88
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.520
During the exploring data step,

89
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.820
you may have discovered that two
features are very correlated.

90
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.460
In that case,
one of these features can be removed

91
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.630
without negatively effecting
the analysis results.

92
00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.110
For example,
the purchase price of a product and

93
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.830
the amount of sales tax pain
are very likely to be correlated.

94
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.860
Eliminating the sales tax
amount then will be beneficial.

95
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.330
Removing redundant or irrelevant features
will make the subsequent analysis simpler.

96
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.870
You may also want to combine features or
create new ones.

97
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.580
For example,
adding the applicants education level

98
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.449
as a feature to a loan approval
application would make sense.

99
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.700
There are also algorithms to
automatically determine the most relevant

100
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.940
features based on various
mathematical properties.

101
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.510
Feature transformation maps the data
from one format to another.

102
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.805
Various transformation operations exist.

103
00:06:36.805 --> 00:06:41.470
For example, scaling maps
the data values to a specified

104
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.630
range to prevent any one feature from
dominating the analysis results.

105
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.900
Filtering or aggregation can be used to
reduce noise and variability in the data.

106
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.160
Dimensionality reduction maps the data
to a smaller subset of dimensions

107
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.020
to simplify the subsequent analysis.

108
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.497
We will discuss techniques to prepare
data in more detail later in this course.

109
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.237
After preparing the data to
address data quality issues and

110
00:07:10.237 --> 00:07:13.020
preprocess it to get it in
the appropriate format,

111
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.680
the next step in the machine learning
process is to analyze the data.

112
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.840
The goals of the staff are to
build a machine learning model,

113
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.960
to analyze the data and to evaluate
the results that you get from the model.

114
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:32.110
The analyze steps starts with this
determining the type of problem you have.

115
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.990
You begin by selecting appropriate machine
learning techniques to analyze the data.

116
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.350
Then you construct the model using
the data that you've prepared.

117
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.220
Once the model is built, you will
want to apply it to new data samples

118
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.450
to evaluate how well the model performs.

119
00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.125
Thus data analysis involves selecting
the appropriate technique for

120
00:07:53.125 --> 00:07:57.375
your problem, building the model,
then evaluating the results.

121
00:07:57.375 --> 00:07:58.855
As there are a different
types of problems,

122
00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:01.855
there are also different
types of analysis techniques.

123
00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:03.097
We will cover algorithms for

124
00:08:03.097 --> 00:08:06.785
building machine learning models in a much
more detail in week three of this course.

125
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.260
The next step in the machine learning
process is reporting results from your

126
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:12.865
analysis.

127
00:08:12.865 --> 00:08:17.020
In reporting your results, it is important
to communicate your insights and

128
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.170
make a case for
what actions should follow.

129
00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:22.545
In reporting your results,

130
00:08:22.545 --> 00:08:26.945
you will want to think about what to
present, as well as how to present.

131
00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:30.912
In deciding what to present, you should
consider what the main results are,

132
00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:33.537
what insights were gained
from your analysis, and

133
00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:36.725
what added value do these insights
bring to the application.

134
00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.517
Keep in mind that even negative results
are valuable lessons learned, and

135
00:08:41.517 --> 00:08:44.730
suggest further avenues for
additional analysis.

136
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.150
Remember that all findings
must be presented so

137
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.840
that informs decisions can be made for
next steps.

138
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.780
In deciding how to present,

139
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.460
remember that visualization is an
important tool in presenting your results.

140
00:08:58.055 --> 00:09:01.285
Plots and summary statistics
discussing the explore step

141
00:09:01.285 --> 00:09:03.625
can be used effectively here as well.

142
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:07.095
You should also have tables with
details from your analysis as backup,

143
00:09:07.095 --> 00:09:09.695
if someone wants to take
a deeper dive into the results.

144
00:09:10.915 --> 00:09:14.785
In summary, you want to report your
findings by presenting your results and

145
00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:17.815
the value added with graphs
using visualization tools.

146
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.710
The final step in
the machine loading process

147
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.600
is to determine what action should be
taken based on the insights gained.

148
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.930
What action should be taken based
on the results of your analysis?

149
00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.110
Should you market certain products
to a specific customer segment to

150
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.630
increase sales?

151
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.730
What inefficiency is can be
removed from your process?

152
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.580
What incentives would be effective
in attracting new customers?

153
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:47.180
Once a specific action
has been determined,

154
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.090
the next step is to implement the action.

155
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.320
Things to consider here include, how can
the action be added to your application?

156
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.020
How will end users be affected?

157
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.030
Assessing the impact of the implemented
action is then necessary to evaluate

158
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.810
the benefits gained.

159
00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.820
The results of this assessment
determine next steps,

160
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.960
which could suggest additional analysis or
further opportunities,

161
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.049
which would begin another cycle
of the machine learning process.

162
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.960
In summary, we've looked at the steps in
the machine learning process in detail.

163
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:26.470
The goals or main activities of each
step were discussed in this lecture.

164
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.570
Remember that this is
an iterative process,

165
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.450
in which each step can be repeated
more than once, and findings from

166
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.750
each step may require a previous step
to be repeated with new information
