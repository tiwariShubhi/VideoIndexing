00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.490
Hello, everyone.
You have probably heard of machine

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.250
learning before, enough to grab your
attention and bring you to this class.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
However, you might be wondering
what machine learning is.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.920
We will talk about that
in this lecture and

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.119
discuss how we can see machine learning
in action in our day-to-day life.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.890
After this video you will be able to
explain what machine learning is.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.440
And list three applications of machine
learning encountered in everyday life.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.170
Since this course is about machine
learning, lets define what that means.

9
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.470
We hear this term a lot these
days used in many contexts.

10
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.240
So it's good to start out with a solid
definition of what machine learning means.

11
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.200
Machine learning is the field of study
that focuses on computer systems that can

12
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.850
learn from data.

13
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.360
That is the system's often called
models can learn to perform a specific

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.600
task by analyzing lots of examples for
a particular problem.

15
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.550
For example, a machine learning
model can learn to recognize

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.600
an image of a cat by being shown lots and
lots of images of cats.

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.710
This notion of learning from data
means that a machine learning

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.960
model can learn a specific task
without being explicitly programmed.

19
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.400
In other words, the machine learning
model is not given the step

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.610
by step instructions on how to
recognize the image of a cat.

21
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.910
Instead, the model learns
what features are important

22
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.030
in determining whether it picture contains
a cat from the data that has analyzed.

23
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.120
Because the model learns to
perform this task from data

24
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.250
it's good to know that the amount and
quality of data available for

25
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.110
building the model are important factors
in how well the model learns the task.

26
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.110
Because machine learning
models can learn from data

27
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.420
that can be used to discover hidden
patterns and trends in the data.

28
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.235
These patterns and trends lead to
valuable insights into the data.

29
00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:57.265
Thus the use of machine learning allows
for data driven decisions to be made for

30
00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:59.095
a particular problem.

31
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:02.745
So to summarize, the field of machine
learning focuses on the study and

32
00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:06.185
construction of computer systems
that can learn from data

33
00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:08.775
without being explicitly programmed.

34
00:02:08.775 --> 00:02:10.025
Machine learning algorithms and

35
00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:13.355
techniques are used to build models,
to discover hidden patterns and

36
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:16.980
trends in the data allowing for
data-driven decisions to be made.

37
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.840
You may have heard that machine learning
is an inter-disciplinary field.

38
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.410
This is very true.

39
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.740
Machine learning combines concepts and
methods from many disciplines, including

40
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.830
math, statistics, computer science,
artificial intelligence, and optimization.

41
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.940
In applying machine learning to a problem,

42
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.060
domain knowledge is essential
to the success of end results.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.520
By domain knowledge we mean
an understanding of the application or

44
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.150
business domain.

45
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.070
Knowledge about the application,
the data related to the application, and

46
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.860
how the outcomes will be used are crucial
to driving the process of building

47
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.540
the machine learning model.

48
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.593
So domain knowledge is also an integral
part of a machine learning solution.

49
00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:04.713
Machine learning has been used in many
different learning application, many of

50
00:03:04.713 --> 00:03:08.410
which you'll probably encounter in your
daily life, perhaps without realizing it.

51
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.030
One application of machine learning that
you likely used this past weekend, or

52
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.650
even just today,
is credit card fraud detection.

53
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.340
Every time you use your credit card,
the current purchase is analyzed

54
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.230
against your history of credit card
transactions to determine if the current

55
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.070
purchase is a legitimate transaction or
a potentially fraudulent one.

56
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.840
If the purchase is very different
from your past purchases, such as for

57
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.480
a big ticket item in a category that
you had never shown an interest in or

58
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.630
when the point of sales location
is from another country,

59
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.860
then it will be flagged
as a suspicious activity.

60
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.100
In that case,
the transaction may be denied.

61
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.990
Or you may get a call from your
credit card company to confirm that

62
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.760
the purchase was indeed made by you.

63
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.560
This is a very common use of machine
learning that is encountered in

64
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.160
everyday life.

65
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.690
Another example application of machine
learning encountered in daily life is

66
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.140
handwritten digit recognition.

67
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.890
When you deposit a hand-written check into
an ATM, a machine learning process is used

68
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.660
to read the numbers written on the check
to determine the amount of the deposit.

69
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.420
Handwritten digits are trickier
to decipher than typed digits

70
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.150
due to the many variations
in people's handwriting.

71
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.130
A machine learning system can sift through
the different variations to find similar

72
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.770
patterns to distinguish a one from a nine,
for example.

73
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.930
Recommendations in what sites is
another example application of

74
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.460
machine learning that most people
have experienced first hand.

75
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.160
After you buy an item on a website you
will often get a list of related items.

76
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.100
Often this will be displayed
as customers who bought this

77
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.380
item also bought these items,
or you may also like.

78
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.130
These related items have been associated
with the item you purchased by

79
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.650
a machine learning model, and

80
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.380
are now being shown to you since
you may also be interested in them.

81
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.160
This is a common application of
machine learning used often in

82
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.040
sales and marketing.

83
00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.600
Here are some other examples of where
machine learning has been used.

84
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.360
Like targeted ads on mobile devices.

85
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.490
Sentiment analysis of social media data,

86
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.570
climate monitoring to detect seasonal
patterns, crime pattern detection, and

87
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.910
a healthiness analysis of drugs
among many other applications.

88
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.580
As you can see from this short list,

89
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.420
machine learning has been used in
various applications including science,

90
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.910
medicine, retail, law enforcement,
education and many others.

91
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.190
Let's take a few minutes to discuss the
different terms which refer to this field.

92
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.290
The term we are using for this course is
machine learning, but you may have heard

93
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.080
other terms such as data mining,
predictive analytics and data slangs.

94
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.480
So what is the difference
between these different terms?

95
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.740
As we have discussed, machine learning
has its roots since statistics,

96
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.590
artificial intelligence, and
computer science among other fields.

97
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.100
Machine learning encompasses
the algorithms and

98
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.990
techniques used to learn from data.

99
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.560
The term data mining became popular
around the time that the use

100
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.820
databases became common place.

101
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.980
So data mining was used to refer to
activities related to finding patterns in

102
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.780
databases and data warehouses.

103
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.290
There are some practical data management
aspects to data mining related to

104
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.380
accessing data from databases.

105
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.460
But the process of finding
patterns in data is similar, and

106
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.320
can use the same algorithms and
techniques as machine learning.

107
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.020
Predictive analytics refers to analyzing
data in order to predict future outcomes.

108
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.090
This term is usually used in the business
context to describe activities such as

109
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.540
sales forecasting or predicting
the purchasing behavior of a customer.

110
00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.060
But again the techniques used to make
these predictions are the same techniques

111
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.790
from machine learning.

112
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.205
Data science is a new term that is
used to describe processing and

113
00:06:55.205 --> 00:06:57.860
analyzing data to extract meaning.

114
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.890
Again machine learning techniques
can also be used here.

115
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.260
Because the term data science became
popular at the same time that big

116
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.670
data began appearing, data science usually
refers to extracting meaning from big data

117
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.380
and so includes approaches for collecting,
storing and managing big data.

118
00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.370
These terms evolved at different times and

119
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.050
may have encompassed
different sets of activities.

120
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.115
But there have always been more
similarities than differences between

121
00:07:22.115 --> 00:07:23.610
them.

122
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.720
Now they are often used
interchangeably and

123
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.370
have come to mean
essentially the same thing.

124
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.127
The process of extracting valuable insight
from data, the core algorithms and

125
00:07:33.127 --> 00:07:36.891
techniques for doing this do not
change with different terms.

126
00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:42.544
To summarize, in this lecture we've
discussed what machine learning is and

127
00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:44.210
how it is being used.

128
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.590
Machine learning models learn from data to
perform a task without being explicitly

129
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.730
programmed.

130
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.650
They are used to discover patterns and
trends in the data.

131
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.060
And a lab for data driven decisions to
be made for the problems being studied.

132
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:01.550
We also discuss in this lecture examples
of how machine learning is being used.

133
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.840
We see how the example applications
that machine learning can be applied

134
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.320
to many different areas.
