00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.020
In this activity, we will be
evaluating the decision tree model

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.788
we created in the KNIME
classification hands-on.

3
00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:12.630
First, we will create a confusion
matrix to determine the accuracy

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.690
of the decision tree model.

5
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.920
Next, we will use highlighting and

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.820
a scatter plot to analyze
the classification errors.

7
00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.969
Let's begin.

8
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:29.281
First, let's open the Classification
workflow that we built in the previous

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.033
hands-on.

10
00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.252
In the top-left of KNIME
is a KNIME Explorer.

11
00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:36.780
Double-click on the Classification,
under LOCAL.

12
00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:43.802
Next, we'll create a confusion
matrix to analyze the accuracy

13
00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:45.530
of our decision tree model.

14
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.380
To do this,
we'll add the Scorer node to the canvas.

15
00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.340
Connect the output of Decision Tree
Predictor, to the input of Scorer.

16
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.480
Double-click on Scorer.

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.635
We'll use the default values, so click OK.

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280
Next, run the workflow.

19
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.810
Now, let's view the confusion matrix.

20
00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:23.570
I can see the accuracy as 80.282%.

21
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.651
At the top, I can see that it
accurately predicted 76 values for

22
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:36.205
humidity_low and 95 for humidity_not_low.

23
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:42.035
It inaccurately predicted 24 values for
humidty_low and

24
00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:48.242
18 for humidty_not_low,
for an error of 19.718%.

25
00:01:48.242 --> 00:01:52.225
Close this.

26
00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:55.875
Next, we use an interactive table to
look at the values that were incorrectly

27
00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:56.500
predicted.

28
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.990
We'll add the Interactive Table
to the canvas.

29
00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:13.872
We'll connect this to the output
of Decision Tree Predictor,

30
00:02:13.872 --> 00:02:16.870
run the workflow and view the table.

31
00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:27.810
The right two columns have the real value
for low_humidity and the prediction.

32
00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:32.150
For some of these rows, we can tell
that the prediction was not correct.

33
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.119
For example, in row ten, And in row 17.

34
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.707
Let's leave the table view open,
and go back to the workflow.

35
00:02:47.707 --> 00:02:51.415
Next, we'll add the Scatter Plot
nodes to the workflow.

36
00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:02.790
Connect this to the output
of Decision Tree Predictor.

37
00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.900
Execute the workflow, and
view the scatter plot.

38
00:03:13.413 --> 00:03:17.840
We'll select row 17, and
choose, Hilite Selected.

39
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.780
Go back to the scatter plot,

40
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.310
and we see this particular value
is highlighted in the plot.

41
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.960
We could choose another
row from the table, and

42
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.570
highlight it again to see
its place in the plot.

43
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.730
Let's choose row ten.

44
00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:40.083
We can do this for
values that were incorrectly predicted,

45
00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:42.620
to find any patterns for further analysis.
