1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.871
In this activity we will be using
KNIME to handle missing data.

2
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:09.045
First, we will create new workflow and
import our weather data.

3
00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:15.571
Next, we will remove missing values for
specific measurement in the data.

4
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.813
We will then impute missing
values with the mean.

5
00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:21.554
And finally,
remove all the rows with missing values.

6
00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:28.145
Let's begin, first,
let's create a new workflow in KNIME.

7
00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:36.558
We'll name it, Handling Missing Values.

8
00:00:42.252 --> 00:00:47.453
Next, let's import the weather
data using the File Reader node.

9
00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:49.421
We'll add the File Reader
node to the canvas.

10
00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:02.060
We'll configure File Reader
to read daily_weather.csv.

11
00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.280
Next, we'll connect the Histogram
node to File Reader.

12
00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:24.909
Before we configure the Histogram node,
we need to run the File Reader node.

13
00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.331
We can do this by clicking on File Reader,
and

14
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:31.677
clicking on the green
arrow in the toolbar.

15
00:01:35.224 --> 00:01:38.259
Next, double-click on
Histogram to configure it.

16
00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.561
We'll set both the binning column and
aggregation columns to air_temp_9am.

17
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:54.259
Next, we'll add a missing value node.

18
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.257
We'll connect this to
the file reader node.

19
00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:09.992
Double click on missing
value to configuring it.

20
00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:13.945
Go to column settings,

21
00:02:13.945 --> 00:02:21.466
select air_temp_9am, and click on Add.

22
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:23.584
We'll then choose remove row.

23
00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:32.298
This will remove the measurements of
air_temp_9am that had missing values.

24
00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:32.948
Click OK.

25
00:02:35.838 --> 00:02:41.106
Next, we'll add another histogram
node to the output of missing value.

26
00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:45.162
We can do this easily by copying and
pasting the existing histogram node.

27
00:02:54.404 --> 00:02:57.144
Now let's run the workflow by
clicking on the double green arrows.

28
00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.491
Let's view the output in
the histogram nodes before and

29
00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:06.592
after we remove missing values.

30
00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:10.158
In this histogram view,
we can see that there are missing values.

31
00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.985
If we go and
look at the second histogram node,

32
00:03:12.985 --> 00:03:15.752
the one after we removed
the missing values.

33
00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.958
We can see that there are no
missing values in this chart.

34
00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:28.748
Next, instead of removing missing values,
let's impute the values to the mean.

35
00:03:28.748 --> 00:03:32.042
We could do this by configuring
the missing value node.

36
00:03:34.865 --> 00:03:39.454
And instead of remove row,
change that to mean.

37
00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:47.050
Click OK, and rerun the work flow.

38
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.906
We could see the difference by comparing
the graphs and the two histogram nodes.

39
00:03:56.182 --> 00:03:57.700
If we go to visualization settings.

40
00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:04.412
And change labels to all elements, we'll
see the number of elements in each band.

41
00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.929
In the histogram,
before we removed the missing values,

42
00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.486
we can see the fifth column
has 216 measurements in it.

43
00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:25.952
Where as the fifth column after we imputed
the missing values has 221 values in it.

44
00:04:25.952 --> 00:04:26.680
Let's close these.

45
00:04:31.608 --> 00:04:36.756
Next, let's remove all the rows that
have missing values in the data.

46
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:39.073
We can do this by double
clicking on missing value.

47
00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:44.770
Removing air_temp_ 9am.

48
00:04:46.918 --> 00:04:48.116
Clicking on the default tab.

49
00:04:50.728 --> 00:04:53.892
Changing this to remove row.

50
00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:59.224
I'll click OK, now we rerun the workflow.

51
00:04:59.224 --> 00:05:03.470
Again, we'll look at the histograms before
and after we remove the missing values.

52
00:05:15.128 --> 00:05:20.170
Again, we'll go to visualization settings
and change the labels to all elements so

53
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.878
we can see the number of
elements in each bin.

54
00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:30.490
We can see the number of elements in
each bin in the different histograms

55
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.149
has changed.
