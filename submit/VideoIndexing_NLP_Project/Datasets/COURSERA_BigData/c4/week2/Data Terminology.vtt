00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.560
If you have been in a conversation
on machine learning,

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.680
you have probably heard terms like
feature, sample, and variable.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.950
We will be defining some of
those terms in this lecture.

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.580
After this video, you will be able
to describe what a feature is, and

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.740
how it relates to a sample.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.480
Name some alternative terms for feature.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.100
Summarize how a categorical feature
differs from a numerical feature.

8
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.300
Before we delve into the methods for
processing and

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.690
analyzing data, let's first start with
defining some term used to describe data,

10
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.610
starting with sample and variable.

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.240
A sample is an instance or
example of an entity in your data.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.150
This is typically a row in your dataset.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.380
This figure shows part of a dataset
of values related to weather.

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.950
Each row is a sample representing
weather data for particular day.

15
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.370
The table in the figure shows four samples
of weather data, each for different day.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.410
In this table, each sample has
five values associated with it.

17
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.430
These values are different
information pieces about the sample

18
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.200
such as the sample ID, sample date,

19
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.660
minimum temperature, maximum temperature,
and rainfall on that day.

20
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.630
We call these different values
variables of the sample.

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.920
There are many names for
sample and variable.

22
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.600
Some other terms for sample that you
might hear in a machine learning

23
00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.470
context include record, example,
row, instance and observation.

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.600
It is helpful to realize that all of
these terms mean the same thing in

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.830
machine learning.

26
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.360
That is, they all refer to a specific
example of an entity in your dataset.

27
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.400
There are also many names for the term
variable, such as feature, column,

28
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.450
dimension, attribute, and field.

29
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.330
All of these terms refer to
specific characteristics for

30
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.660
each sample in your dataset.

31
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.540
An important point to emphasize
about variable is that,

32
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.380
they are additional
values with a data type.

33
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.550
Each variable has a data
type associated with it.

34
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.630
The most common data types are numeric and
categorical.

35
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.080
There are other data types as
well such as string and date but

36
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.260
we will focus on two of the more common
data types, numeric and categorical.

37
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.720
As the name implies, numeric variables
are variables that take on number values.

38
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.320
Numeric variables can be measured, and
their values can be sorted in some way.

39
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.120
Note that a numeric variable can
take on just integer values or

40
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.950
be continuous valued.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.600
It can also have just positive numbers,
negative numbers or both.

42
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.750
Let's go over some examples
of various numeric variables.

43
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.570
A person's height is a positive,
continuous valued number.

44
00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.220
The score in an exam is a positive number
that range between zero and a 100%.

45
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.280
The number of transactions per
hour is a positive integer,

46
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.030
whereas the change in a stock price
can be either positive or negative.

47
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.650
A variable with labels,
names, or categories for

48
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.070
values instead of numbers
are called categorical variables.

49
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.250
For example a variable that describes
the color of an item, such as the color of

50
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:28.948
a car, can have values such as red,
silver, blue, white and black.

51
00:03:28.948 --> 00:03:32.140
These are non-numeric values
that describes some quality or

52
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.650
characteristic of an entity.

53
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.670
These values can be thought of as names or
labels that can be sorted into categories.

54
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.450
Therefore, categorical variables are also
referred to as qualitative variables, or

55
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.650
nominal variables.

56
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.340
Some examples of categorical
variables are gender, marital status,

57
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.640
type of customer, for example,
teenager, adult, senior.

58
00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.310
Product categories, for example,
electronics, kitchen, bathroom and

59
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.200
color of an item.

60
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.790
To summarize, a sample is an instance or
example of an entity in your data.

61
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.190
A variable captures a specific
characteristic of each entity.

62
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.800
So a sample has many
variables to describe it.

63
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.786
Data from real applications
are often multidimensional,

64
00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:24.240
meaning that there are many dimensions or
variables describing each sample.

65
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.430
Each variable has a data
type associated with it,

66
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.280
the most common data types are numeric and
categorical.

67
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.633
Note that there are many terms to
describe these data related concepts.
