1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.720
In this activity, we will use KNIME to
perform data exploration of weather data.

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.000
First, we will create
a new KNIME workflow.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.560
We'll then input the weather data.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.740
Next, we will create
a histogram of air temperature.

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.250
Create a scatter plot
between two variables.

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.930
Create a bar chart to show the
distribution of a categorical variable.

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.700
And finally, create a box plot to
compare two different distributions.

8
00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:34.350
Let's begin.

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.660
First, we will create
a new workflow in KNIME.

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.000
To do this we go to the File menu.

11
00:00:41.277 --> 00:00:48.890
Select new, select new KNIME workflow and
click on next.

12
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.720
Then we type the name of
the workflow we want to create.

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.380
We'll call this one plots.

14
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:57.710
Click on finish.

15
00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.690
Next we want to load
weather data into KNIME.

16
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.710
To do this we'll use a file reader node.

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.890
To add this node,
go to the bottom left node repository.

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.220
And in the box type in file reader.

19
00:01:15.298 --> 00:01:19.670
Drag File Reader to the canvas.

20
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.890
Next, double click on File Reader to
configure it with the weather data.

21
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.900
Click on the Browse button.

22
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.360
We'll choose the weather file.

23
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.084
That's daily_weather.csv.

24
00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:38.875
We can see preview of
the data at the bottom half

25
00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:41.410
of the file reader configure dialog.

26
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.270
You can see values for
each column in the CSV file.

27
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.440
Click OK to close the dialog.

28
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.510
Next, we want to create
a histogram of air temperature.

29
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.410
We'll add the histogram
node to the workflow.

30
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.230
Again, we go to the node repository and
type in histogram.

31
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.170
We'll drag and
drop histogram to the workflow and

32
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.700
we'll connect File Reader to histogram.

33
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.327
We'll click and
hold on output to File Reader and

34
00:02:13.327 --> 00:02:16.610
drag to the input of histogram and
release.

35
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.520
Before we configure the histogram node,
we need to run the file reader node.

36
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.662
We can do that by selecting
the file reader and

37
00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:30.913
either clicking on the green
arrow at the top or

38
00:02:30.913 --> 00:02:34.952
right clicking and choosing execute here.

39
00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:42.508
Once we've done that,
double-click on histogram.

40
00:02:42.508 --> 00:02:48.176
We'll select error_temp_9AM
as the biding column and

41
00:02:48.176 --> 00:02:54.520
also add error_temp_9AM to
the aggregation column.

42
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.570
We'll leave the default
number of bins as ten.

43
00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.020
Click on OK.

44
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.070
Now we'll run the workflow.

45
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.060
You can click on the two arrow green
button at the top to run all the nodes.

46
00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.420
Now let's view the histogram.

47
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.690
Right click on the histogram node.

48
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.453
And choose View, Histogram View.

49
00:03:17.453 --> 00:03:21.530
The x-axis shows the value for
each bin in the histogram.

50
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.850
And the y-axis is the count, or frequency.

51
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.000
We can see the most frequent
values are between 60 and 73.

52
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.119
On the right, we also see that
there's some with missing values.

53
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.250
Next close the window.

54
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.550
Now let's create a scatter plot to show
the relationship between two variables.

55
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.430
First, we will add the scatter
plot node to the work flow.

56
00:03:50.128 --> 00:03:54.870
We'll connect the the output of
File Reader to the input of Scatter Plot.

57
00:03:56.244 --> 00:04:01.700
Execute the workflow, right-click on

58
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.650
Scatter Plot and choose View Scatter Plot.

59
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.560
We'll click on the Column Selection and
choose air_temp_9am for the X Column.

60
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.990
And for the Y Column,
choose relative humidity 9 AM.

61
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.630
In this plot,

62
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.650
we can see a negative correlation
between temperature and humidity.

63
00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.650
As the temperature increases,
the humidity goes down.

64
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.480
We'll close this window.

65
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.890
Next, we'll create a bar chart to show the
distribution of a categorical variable.

66
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.120
We'll visualize the wind
direction at 9 AM.

67
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.290
We will begin by creating the categorical
variable by using the numeric binner node.

68
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.400
Let's add numeric binner to the work flow.

69
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:56.510
We'll connect the output of file
reader to the input of numeric binner.

70
00:04:57.675 --> 00:05:01.528
Double-click on Numeric Binner
to configure it.

71
00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:05.799
Select max_wind_direction_9am and

72
00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:09.950
click on add five times to add five bins.

73
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.050
Now let's give a name for
each of these bins.

74
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.180
Select a bin and now choose a name.

75
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.920
The first will be for the North direction.

76
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.938
So we'll call that 1-N.

77
00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:29.214
Next, 2-E for East, 3-S for

78
00:05:29.214 --> 00:05:34.444
South, 4-W for West and

79
00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:38.630
finally 1-N for north again.

80
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.340
Now we need to specify the values for
each of these bins.

81
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.010
We'll select the first one and
set the endpoint to be 45 degrees.

82
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.820
Next, choose east and
set that maximum to be 135.

83
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.360
Select the third one and
choose the max to be 225.

84
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.110
Finally, select the fourth one and
select the max to be 315.

85
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.510
Next, click on a pin new column.

86
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.368
Set the name for categorical variable to
be categorical underscore max underscore.

87
00:06:14.368 --> 00:06:18.531
Wind_direction_9AM.

88
00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.740
Click OK.

89
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.880
Now add a histogram note to the work flow.

90
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:34.455
Connect the output of
Numeric Binner to histogram.

91
00:06:34.455 --> 00:06:38.630
Double-click on Histogram to configure it.

92
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.908
Make sure they binning column is
categorical_max_wind_direction_9AM.

93
00:06:44.908 --> 00:06:47.160
And also there are no aggregation columns.

94
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.140
Click OK and execute the work flow.

95
00:06:54.066 --> 00:06:55.840
Let's view the chart.

96
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.170
Right click on Histogram and
choose View, Histogram View.

97
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.720
This tells us that most of the wind
comes from the east and the south.

98
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.620
And not many measurements from the north.

99
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.650
Next, close this.

100
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.252
Now lets create a box plot to
compare two different distributions.

101
00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:22.380
We w'll examine the distribution,
air pressure for

102
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.610
low humidity days versus normal or
high humidity days.

103
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.810
To do this, we'll first need to creat
a categorical variable for humidity.

104
00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.800
Lets add another numeric
binner actor to the workflow.

105
00:07:36.599 --> 00:07:40.190
Connect the output,
a file reader to this actor.

106
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.500
Double click to configure.

107
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.830
Select relative humidity, 9 AM.

108
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:49.830
And click on add twice to add two bins.

109
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.350
Select the first bin and
we'll call that humidity_low.

110
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:03.750
Select the second bin and
we'll call that humidity_not_low.

111
00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:06.859
Select the first bin, and

112
00:08:06.859 --> 00:08:11.390
we'll set the maximum value to 25.

113
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.900
Check append new column.

114
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:21.130
And set the name to low_humidity_day,
click on OK.

115
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.110
Next, add the conditional box
plot node to the workflow.

116
00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:33.310
Right click on conditional
box plot to configure it.

117
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.891
Make sure the nominal column
is low_humidity_day and

118
00:08:37.891 --> 00:08:41.100
the numeric column is air_pressure_9am.

119
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.010
Click OK.

120
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.260
Run the workflow.

121
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:53.410
Right click on conditional box plot and
choose few additional box plot.

122
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.870
And the x axis, we see the two values or
a categorical variable, humidity low and

123
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.650
humidity not low.

124
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.000
The y axis shows the air pressure values.

125
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:09.300
I can see that on average,
lower humidity means higher air pressure.

126
00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:13.750
Close this.

127
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.330
Finally, save the workflow when
we're done by clicking on the disk

128
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:18.630
at the top left of the toolbar.
