00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.230
In this lesson you will learn how
to prepare data for analysis.

2
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.950
After this video, you will be able
to articulate the importance of data

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.480
preparation, define the objectives
of data preparation, and

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.310
list some activities in preparing data.

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.040
The raw data that you get directly from
your sources is rarely in the format

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.790
that you can use to perform analysis on.

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.070
The goal of data preparation is to create
the data that will be used for analysis.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.240
This means cleaning the data, and putting
the data in the right format for analysis.

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.470
The latter generally involves selecting
the appropriate features to use and

10
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.070
transforming the data as needed.

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.950
The data that you've acquired
will likely have many problems.

12
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.940
An important part of data preparation is
to clean the data that you have to work

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.030
with to address what are referred
to as data quality issues.

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.049
There are many types of
data quality issues,

15
00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.176
including missing values, duplicate data,

16
00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:10.180
inconsistent or invalid data,
noise, and outliers.

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.310
The problems listed here can negatively
affect the quality of the data and

18
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.430
compromise the analysis process and
results.

19
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.139
So it is very important to detect and
address these data quality issues.

20
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.260
Some techniques to address data quality
issues include removing data records

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.250
with missing values,
merging duplicate records,

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.430
generating a best, or at most reasonable,
estimate for invalid values.

23
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.859
We will discuss these techniques in
more detail in the next lecture.

24
00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.135
Since the goal of the step of data
preparation is cleaning the data,

25
00:01:45.135 --> 00:01:48.520
it is referred to as Data Cleaning or
Data Cleansing.

26
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.360
After the data has been cleaned,
another goal of data preparation is to

27
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.720
get the data into the format needed for
the analysis.

28
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.709
This step is referred to by many names,
Data Munching, Data Wrangling and

29
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.220
Data Preprocessing.

30
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.910
The two broad categories of data
wrangling are feature selection and

31
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.940
feature transformation.

32
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.770
Feature selection involves
deciding on which features

33
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.150
to use from the existing
ones available in your data.

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.860
Features can be removed,
added or combined.

35
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.770
Feature transformation involves
changing the format of the data

36
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.610
in some way to reduce noise or variability
or make the data easier to analyze.

37
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.450
Two common feature transformations
are scaling the data so

38
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.260
that all features have the same value
range and reducing the dimensionality,

39
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.490
which is effectively the number
of features of the data.

40
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.750
We will discuss these techniques
later in this lesson.

41
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.390
Data preparation is a very important
part of the machine learning process.

42
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.840
It can be a tedious process,
but it is a crucial step.

43
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.750
If you do not spend the time and
effort to create good data for

44
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.230
the analysis,
you will not get good results,

45
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.200
no matter how sophisticated the analysis
technique you are using is.

46
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.530
Always remember, garbage in, garbage out.

47
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.189
So take the time to prepare your data
if you want good analysis results.
