1
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.380
In this hands on activity,
we will be performing queries in Splunk.

2
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.980
First, we will open a browser and
login to Splunk.

3
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.590
Next, we will import a CSV file and
search its contents.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.030
We will see how to filter fields for
specific values and

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.532
also perform statistical
calculations on the data.

6
00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:23.678
Let's begin.

7
00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:28.236
First, open a web browser and
navigate to the Splunk web page.

8
00:00:28.236 --> 00:00:33.103
We'll enter localhost:8000.

9
00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:41.870
Next we'll log in to Splunk using
admin and the default password.

10
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.231
Next, we'll import a CSV file into Splunk.

11
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.952
We'll click on Add Data.

12
00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.704
Upload We'll click on Select File.

13
00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.838
And we'll choose the census.csv
file that we downloaded.

14
00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:17.583
Click Next.

15
00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.010
On the left,
it should say source type csv.

16
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.066
If it does not, click on the button and

17
00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:35.128
go down to Structured and select csv.

18
00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:37.290
In this table,
we see a preview of the data.

19
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.100
You should see the column names
of the CSV file at the top.

20
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.360
Click on Next.

21
00:01:48.372 --> 00:01:49.888
Review.

22
00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:52.227
And Submit.

23
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:58.797
Now that the file has been imported
successfully, click on Start Searching.

24
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:09.539
In the search box,
it fills in the default query,

25
00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.260
source="cencus.csv" the host name and
sourcetype="csv"

26
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:22.067
We could change these fields
to search other files or

27
00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.894
other data types if we
imported those into Splunk.

28
00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:31.135
Now let's search census.csv for
particular values in the fields.

29
00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:34.478
Let's search for all the data
where the state is California.

30
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:40.908
We'll enter STNAME="California".

31
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:50.521
You'll see the results down here.

32
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:53.604
You could search for
other states by using or.

33
00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:57.581
For example, we can add OR
STNAME="Alaska".

34
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:01.840
This will search for
state names equal to California or Alaska.

35
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.270
We can add conditions
to our query as well.

36
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.930
Let's search for state equals California
whose population was over one million.

37
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.467
We'll do this by saying
STNAME = "California"

38
00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:26.925
CENSUS2010POP > 1000000.

39
00:03:32.477 --> 00:03:35.900
Can limit the results to one or
more columns.

40
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.446
You do this by adding pipe table
CTYNAME to the end of our query.

41
00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:52.336
In Spunk queries, the pipe command is used
to send the outputs from the first part of

42
00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:53.778
the query into the next.

43
00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.441
You can also show more than
one column from the output.

44
00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:02.982
If we add a comma CENSUS2010POP
to the end of this,

45
00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:07.145
we'll see both the city name and
the population.

46
00:04:07.145 --> 00:04:10.944
You can also see a visualization of this
data by clicking on the Visualization tab.

47
00:04:13.883 --> 00:04:18.344
At the bottom, on the x-axis,
we see the county names, and

48
00:04:18.344 --> 00:04:21.420
the y values are the population numbers.

49
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.994
Now let's perform some
statistics on this data.

50
00:04:27.994 --> 00:04:31.630
We'll begin by counting the number of
records where the state is California.

51
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.951
You can do this by saying
STNAME="California" pipe stats count.

52
00:04:44.282 --> 00:04:49.468
Now switch back to the statistics tab,
see the result here

53
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.775
Now let's see the total population for
California.

54
00:04:55.775 --> 00:05:01.241
You can replace count
with sum(CENUS2010POP)

55
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.923
You can also calculate
the average population.

56
00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:09.781
We'll replace sum with mean.
