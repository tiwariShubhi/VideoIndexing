00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.280
Hello, My name is Mitch Fleichmann,
senior instructor here at Splunk.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.670
Today we are going to
install Splunk on Linux.

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.760
I'm using one of
the Splunk Education Linux servers.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.564
Let's examine the environment.

5
00:00:17.146 --> 00:00:21.040
First of all,
notice I'm logged in as the user splunker.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.600
As a best practice,
do not install Splunk as the root user.

7
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.498
I'm currently in the /opt directory,
where I've already downloaded

8
00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:38.426
the tarball from splunk.com/download for
this platform.

9
00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:45.755
As a final check, let's check the system
to make sure we have the correct operating

10
00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:46.932
system and kernel.

11
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.072
This is indeed a Linux machine, let's
get confirmation that it is also 64 bit.

12
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.090
So we are good to go.

13
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.519
The next step is to unzip and
untar the installer and

14
00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:10.729
that we can do with the gunzip and
tar commands.

15
00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:23.650
When everything untucks, you'll notice
a new sub directory created named splunk.

16
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.670
And we can navigate to the splunk/bin
directory to start up Splunk.

17
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.000
Couple of ways to start
Splunk with no switches.

18
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.890
On the first startup, you'll be prompted
to read and agree to the software license.

19
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.141
Or as a shortcut, you can start
up Splunk and accept the license.

20
00:01:55.707 --> 00:02:00.315
And notice a couple of port numbers
being grabbed, port 8000 for

21
00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:03.902
splunk web and port 8089 for
splunk management.

22
00:02:08.003 --> 00:02:09.528
The splunk daemon has started.

23
00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.603
Splunk is generating its own keys.

24
00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:21.520
And we can see the splunk web interface,
the URL.

25
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.950
As a best practice,

26
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.050
you may also want to consider automating
splunk to start when the machine boots.

27
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.635
That you can do as the root user.

28
00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:41.841
By issuing the splunk enable command,

29
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:46.686
enable boot-start as the -user splunker,

30
00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:51.793
the same user that we
just consult splunk with.

31
00:03:00.498 --> 00:03:03.960
So lets log in to splunk web and
see how the system looks.

32
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.410
And for that we'll go back to the browser.

33
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.230
Go to the appropriate URL.

34
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.360
And we can see upon first login,

35
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.730
you are prompted to login with
the credentials admin, password changeme.

36
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.780
Since this is the first login,

37
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.170
you also coach to change your
password to something more secure.

38
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.218
And it's highly recommended to
follow this best practice as well.

39
00:03:46.435 --> 00:03:48.027
And also on first connection,

40
00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:51.715
you'll also see a splash screen
showing you what's new in version 6.

41
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.950
In this case, Powerful Analytics.

42
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.790
Some changes to the UI to
make it more intuitive.

43
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.919
Simplified component management for
cluster management,

44
00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.647
folder management and so on.

45
00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:10.651
Also a richer developer experience.

46
00:04:14.147 --> 00:04:17.560
Close down this window and
you can explore the navigation options.

47
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.410
And notice in the left side,

48
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.470
you see a panel showing you
the apps to navigate to and manage.

49
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.060
And on the right side, you see some
panel showing you data in the system and

50
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.380
various links for help.

51
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.936
Let's go to the search and
reporting app by clicking here.

52
00:04:39.527 --> 00:04:43.879
And you can see the search far up top,

53
00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:49.788
some tips on how to search and
then data to search.

54
00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:53.720
Since this is a fresh install,
there is no data to search, so

55
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.049
the next step is to index data and
begin searching.

56
00:04:57.049 --> 00:04:57.890
Good luck.
