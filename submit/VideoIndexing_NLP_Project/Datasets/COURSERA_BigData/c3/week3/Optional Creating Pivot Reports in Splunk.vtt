00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.180
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.180
My name is Rene and I'll be sharing with
you, how to create a report using Pivot.

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.920
To access the Pivot interface,
click Pivot on the navigation menu.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.370
The first step is to select
a prebuilt data model.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.260
Now the data model allows you
to create compelling reports and

6
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.090
dashboards without having to know
how to write complex search queries.

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.000
As a side note data models are typically
created by a knowledge manager that

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.200
understands their
organization's index data.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760
Grasps the search language and
are familiar with lookups,

10
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.640
transactions, field extractions and
calculated fields.

11
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.260
For our example, we're going to
use Buttercup Games Online Sales.

12
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.960
Now, this data model includes
the online sales activities.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.100
It's made up of nine objects.

14
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.660
Each object represents a specific set
of events in a hierarchical structure.

15
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.390
The http request would include the largest
number of events in this data model.

16
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.540
The next object, successful request,

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.950
would be a subset of the http
request events and so on.

18
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.710
Let's say that we want to create a report
for purchases over the last seven days.

19
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.560
We would select the most
appropriate object.

20
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.200
In this case we're going to
select successful purchase.

21
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.940
After you have selected the object
you will notice that a new

22
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.460
Pivot view will display.

23
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.950
If you notice, the count of
successful purchase is the total

24
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.580
number of events for this specific object.

25
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.780
Now, it is based off of all time.

26
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.840
Before you begin, you should have an idea
of what type of report you want to create.

27
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.720
So let's say that we
want to create a bar chart.

28
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.120
We're going to select that
from the left navigation pane.

29
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.375
So the third icon will allow me
to click and select Bar Chart.

30
00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:18.130
So at this point we are ready
to start building our report.

31
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.310
The first selection is Time Range.

32
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.480
Let's set that to the last seven days.

33
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.780
The next one is Filter, now we don't need
to define Filter, because we've already

34
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.210
selected an object of successful purchase
and that's what we're reporting against.

35
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.570
Now, for my x axis,
I'm going to select product name.

36
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.040
You'll notice that I can set the label.

37
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.170
I can set the sort order.

38
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.091
I can even set how many
maximum bars that I want.

39
00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:56.988
The next thing to define is the y axis.

40
00:02:56.988 --> 00:03:01.970
At this time it's set to
count of successful purchase.

41
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.325
But I want the total sales by product.

42
00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:07.785
So I'm going to select price and

43
00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:12.655
then you'll notice that my
value is already set to sum.

44
00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:14.475
So I'm going to keep it as sum.

45
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.030
My report is starting to look really good.

46
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:25.370
But after reviewing it I might decide that
I want to see values segmented by host.

47
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.670
So let's do that,
in order to set the segmentation

48
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:38.290
of a specific product name I could go and
set the color to the field that I want.

49
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.824
So I'm going to select Host.

50
00:03:42.936 --> 00:03:49.490
Now, you'll see that my total
sales are segmented by host.

51
00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:52.566
So we really like this report.

52
00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.190
Let's go ahead and save it.

53
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.860
So we're going to click on Save As.

54
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.560
Select report and give it a title.

55
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.810
Let's call it Product Sales by Host.

56
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.684
We're going to click Save and
then we're going to view our report.

57
00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:19.880
It was that easy to create
a report through Pivot.

58
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.030
Now, let's just say that we want to go and
work with another Pivot.

59
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.810
This time we're going to just go and

60
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.070
create a statistic table
to view some of that data.

61
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.917
Let's go ahead and click Pivot again.

62
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.090
We'll select the same data model.

63
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.637
Buttercup games online sales and
let's keep to the object that

64
00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:47.855
we're familiar with right now,
successful purchases.

65
00:04:54.902 --> 00:04:59.920
As I mentioned, I want to just
simply create a statistic table.

66
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.400
I want to show you how
we'd go about doing that.

67
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:11.700
So the first step is to think about what
are some of the row data that you want?

68
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:18.790
Let's just assume that we want to view
the product names within their categories.

69
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.500
So, let's go ahead, under Split Rows,
we're going to select category first.

70
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.060
Notice that I can set a label if I want.

71
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.500
Let's go ahead and
set it capitalized category.

72
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.897
I'm going to add that to my table.

73
00:05:33.897 --> 00:05:38.403
You'll see that it
becomes the first column.

74
00:05:38.403 --> 00:05:42.240
Now I want to add another column.

75
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.535
Let's go ahead and
click the plus right next to categories.

76
00:05:46.535 --> 00:05:49.995
Again we're still working
with the split rows.

77
00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:56.375
I'm going to select product name, again if
you want to set a label you can do that.

78
00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:58.955
Now this is the label of our column.

79
00:06:00.175 --> 00:06:00.675
Add to table.

80
00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:09.282
And I want you to notice that
now we are viewing each product

81
00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:11.400
within their category.

82
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.130
Now at this point if you look at
the statistic that is being defined,

83
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.850
it's the count of successful purchases.

84
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.570
That is defined as column values.

85
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.960
Now if I want to add to this,
I can append and have another column.

86
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.050
Let's go ahead and click the plus next
to the Count of successful purchase.

87
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.300
This time I want to add the price.

88
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.216
And you'll notice that I have
different values available.

89
00:06:41.216 --> 00:06:44.662
I could do a Sum, a Count,
an Average, Max, Min.

90
00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:51.274
Let's keep it as a Sum and
let's add a label of Total Sales.

91
00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:53.795
And let's Add To Table.

92
00:06:55.955 --> 00:06:59.675
So this is just to show you
how quick it is to go and

93
00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:03.955
build a table with the statistics
that you would need.

94
00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:07.977
Now at this point, if ever you decide,
I only want to view the data for

95
00:07:07.977 --> 00:07:09.260
the last seven days.

96
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.590
Just note that you could go
back up to your filter and

97
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.630
your first filter is
based off of all time.

98
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.870
So we could set that to
the last seven days.

99
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.610
So of course that the data
in our table will change.

100
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.030
Now, the last thing I want to show you
here is if ever you did want to see

101
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.075
the count and the total sales per host,
as we've defined in our previous example.

102
00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:41.615
That is where you could go
to the split columns and

103
00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:44.325
define how you wish to
split that information.

104
00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:47.825
So let's go ahead and select host again.

105
00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:50.731
And I'm just going to
click on add to table.

106
00:07:55.074 --> 00:08:02.820
Now I could see that the information
has been split by host.

107
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:08.460
I have www1 count of successful
purchases as well as total sales.

108
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:15.810
And then I have the split of www2 I have
the count and the total sales and etc.

109
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:20.950
So this concludes our short
video hope you enjoy it.

110
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:21.450
Thank you.
