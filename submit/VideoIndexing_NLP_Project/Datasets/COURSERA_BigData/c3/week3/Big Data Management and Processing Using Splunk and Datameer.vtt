00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:09.185
Amarnath just finished overviewing
querying and integrational big data.

2
00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:13.160
Although, fundamental understanding
of these concepts are important.

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.520
Some of these tasks can be accomplished

4
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.650
using graphical user interface
based tools or software products.

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.870
In this short module,
we introduce you to two of those tools.

6
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.810
Splunk and Datameer.

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.720
We have selected a few videos from
the site of our sponsors Splunk,

8
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.900
to give you an overview of using such
tools for different applications.

9
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.940
You will also have a short
hands-on activity on Splunk.

10
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.210
In addition,
we provide you a comprehensive video on

11
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.110
using Datamere in
the digital music industry.

12
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.150
Keep in mind, Splunk and
Datamere are just two of the many

13
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.613
tools in this category, but
they represent a huge industry.
