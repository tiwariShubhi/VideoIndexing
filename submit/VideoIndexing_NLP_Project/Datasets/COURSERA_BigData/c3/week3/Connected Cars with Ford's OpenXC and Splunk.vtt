00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.205
Open XC is an open source hardware-software platform.

2
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:25.230
We wanted to see what correlations we could actually create within this model dashboards.

3
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.915
It plugs into your car, and it gives you all the data that you can possibly want.

4
00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.510
What we're interested in is looking at how you

5
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.070
can make the car much more modular and customizable,

6
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.365
getting a lot of this data and afford cars

7
00:00:38.365 --> 00:00:40.750
out and letting developers do whatever they want with it.

8
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.170
You could kind of like update technology as technology progresses.

9
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.930
So what we're really trying to do is like catch up with

10
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.060
the consumer electronics design cycle not the automotive design cycle types.

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.265
The clock hasn't started yet.

12
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:56.120
One of the tests that we did was a gas car versus an electric car.

13
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.230
So we're trying to see which is faster,

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.965
which is expecting the most energy,

15
00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:02.070
which is the most cost efficient.

16
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.240
And we wanted to

17
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.025
measure doesn't electric car driver drive different than a gas car driver.

18
00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.345
So actually by using the Open XC data,

19
00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:13.120
and by splunking that creating links in

20
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.190
dashboards will give it to match ups and correlations.

21
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.965
It all comes down to how much are they mashing the gas.

22
00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:35.410
We've been internally calling that dashboard the "Lead Foot Dashboard".

23
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.060
Who's the most efficient driver?

24
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.740
There's one of our drivers actually going low and

25
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.085
slow and actually using into the brakes not really gnashing on the gas,

26
00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.635
and driving more like a normal person would.

27
00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:07.265
When you drive an electric car, it's a lot quicker off the line than a gas powered car.

28
00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:10.215
So, we find people kind of smashing

29
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:13.975
on the gas pedal but sort of easing up on the electric pedal.

30
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:15.595
So I've got some data for you here.

31
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.950
We see. What's this I'm doing?

32
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.995
It says you're doing.

33
00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:20.645
There we go.

34
00:02:20.645 --> 00:02:24.570
Battery car is high. There you go.

35
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.230
Hurry up.

36
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.735
There we go. We don't even need because Open XC, We just cut it.

37
00:02:29.735 --> 00:02:31.670
These are basically all of

38
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.160
the sensor readings that are being broadcast from that Firefly box.

39
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.455
It's plugged into the diagnostics port of the car.

40
00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:41.350
It's about how much power can we kind of give

41
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.190
away in order to incentivize a community of makers.

42
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.645
We want to be able to actually harness that and create

43
00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:50.605
an environment where they can much more quickly,

44
00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:51.990
experiment with our ideas,

45
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.725
enrich the platform in general,

46
00:02:54.725 --> 00:02:59.130
make our vehicles in that sense more valuable.
