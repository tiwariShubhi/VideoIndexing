00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.460
Analytical operations
in big data pipelines.

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.730
After this video,

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.080
you will be able to list common analytical
operations within big data pipelines and

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.650
describe sample applications for
these analytical operations.

5
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.200
In this lesson, we will be
looking at analytical operations.

6
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.810
These are operations used in analytics,
which is the process of

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.370
transforming data into insights for
making more informed decisions.

8
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.720
The purpose of analytical operations is to
analyze the data to discover meaningful

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.089
trends and patterns, in order to gain
insights into the problem being studied.

10
00:00:45.138 --> 00:00:47.810
The knowledge gained from these insights

11
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.890
ultimately lead to more informed
decisions driven by data.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.326
Here are some common analytical operations
that we will discuss in this lecture.

13
00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:02.704
Classification, clustering,

14
00:01:02.704 --> 00:01:06.380
path analysis and connectivity analysis.

15
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.490
Let's start with classification.

16
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:18.130
In classification, the goal is to predict
a categorical target from the input data.

17
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.290
A categorical target is one
with discreet values or

18
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.820
categories, instead of continuous values.

19
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460
For example, this diagram shows

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.260
a classification task to determine the
risk associated with a loan application.

21
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.801
The input consists of the loan amount,

22
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:44.571
applicant information such as income,
age, debts, and a down payment.

23
00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:50.903
From this input data,
the task is to determine whether

24
00:01:50.903 --> 00:01:54.898
the loan application is low risk or
high risk.

25
00:01:57.216 --> 00:02:00.852
There are many classification techniques
or algorithms that can be used for

26
00:02:00.852 --> 00:02:02.480
this problem.

27
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.160
We will discuss a specific one, namely,
decision tree in the next slide.

28
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.590
The decision tree algorithm is
one technique for classification.

29
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.000
With this technique,

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.040
decisions to perform the classification
task are modeled as a tree structure.

31
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.770
For the loan risk assessment problem,
a simple decision tree is shown here,

32
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.470
where the loan application is
classified as being either low risk, or

33
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.930
high risk, based on the loan amount.

34
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.750
The applicant's income,
and the applicant's age.

35
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.110
The decision tree algorithm is implemented
in many machine learning tools.

36
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.718
This diagram shows how to specify
decision tree from input data, KNIME.

37
00:02:51.718 --> 00:02:55.650
A graphical user-interface-based
machine learning platform.

38
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.400
Some examples of classification
are the prediction of whether cells from

39
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.540
a tumor are benign or
malignant, categorization of

40
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.630
handwritten digits as being zero,
one, two, etc, up to nine.

41
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.760
And determining whether a credit card
transaction is legitimate or fraudulent,

42
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.255
and classification of a loan application
as being low-risk, medium-risk or

43
00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:26.540
high-risk, as you've seen.

44
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.970
Another common analytical
operation is cluster analysis.

45
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.880
In cluster analysis, or clustering,

46
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.320
the goal is to organize similar
items in to groups of association.

47
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.045
This diagram shows an example of cluster
analysis in which customers are clustered

48
00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:51.510
into groups according to their
preferences of movie genre.

49
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.450
So, customers who like Sci-Fi
movies are grouped together.

50
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.814
Those who like drama movies
are grouped together,

51
00:04:01.814 --> 00:04:06.337
and customers who like horror
movies are grouped together.

52
00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:10.482
With this grouping, new movies,
as well as other products,

53
00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:15.184
such as books, can be offered to
the right type of costumers in order to

54
00:04:15.184 --> 00:04:18.073
generate interest and increase revenue.

55
00:04:20.775 --> 00:04:25.516
A simple and commonly used algorithm for
cluster analysis is k-means.

56
00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:31.670
With k-means,
samples are divided into k clusters.

57
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.100
This clustering is done in order
to minimize the variance or

58
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.620
similarity between samples
within the same cluster

59
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.590
using some similarity
measures such as distance.

60
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.210
In this example, k is equal to three, and

61
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:53.170
k-means divides the original data shown
on the left into three clusters,

62
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.620
shown as blue, green, and
red on the chart on the right.

63
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.530
The k-means clustering algorithm is
implemented on many machine-learning

64
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.180
platforms.

65
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.550
The code here shows how to read in and

66
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.190
parse input data, and
perform k-means clustering on the data.

67
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.210
Other examples of cluster analysis
are grouping a companyâ€™s customer base

68
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.560
into distinct segments for more effective
targeted marketing, finding articles or

69
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.240
webpages with similar topics for
retrieving relevant information.

70
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.844
Identification of areas in the city with
rates of particular types of crimes for

71
00:05:35.844 --> 00:05:40.077
effective management of law
enforcement resources, and

72
00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:46.055
determining different groups of weather
patterns such as rainy, cold or snowy.

73
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.632
Classification and cluster analysis
are considered machine learning and

74
00:05:51.632 --> 00:05:53.620
analytical operations.

75
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.790
There are also analytical
operations from graph analytics,

76
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.790
which is the field of analytics where
the underlying data is structured as, or

77
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.670
can be modeled as the set of graphs.

78
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.190
One analytical operation using
graphs as path analysis,

79
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.000
which analyzes sequences of nodes and
edges in a graph.

80
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.500
A common application of path analysis

81
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:21.980
is to find routes from one
location to another location.

82
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.440
For example, you might want to find the
shortest path from your home to your work.

83
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.100
This path may be different depending on
conditions such as the day of the week,

84
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.450
time of day, traffic congestion,
weather and etc.

85
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:43.530
This code shows some operations for
path analysis on neo4j,

86
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.033
which is a graph database system
using a query language called Cypher.

87
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.440
The first operation finds the shortest
path between specific nodes in a graph.

88
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.460
The second operation finds all
the shortest paths in a graph.

89
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.770
Connectivity analysis of graphs
has to do with finding and

90
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.970
tracking groups to determine
interactions between entities.

91
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.330
Entities in highly interacting
groups are more connected

92
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.680
to each other than to entities
of other groups in a graph.

93
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.860
These groups are called communities, and

94
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.280
are interesting to analyze as they
give insights into the degree and

95
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:31.410
patterns of the interaction between
entities, and also between communities.

96
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.570
Some applications of connectivity analysis
are to extract conversation threads.

97
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.030
For example,
by looking at tweets and retweets.

98
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.720
To find interacting groups, for example,
to determine which users are interacting

99
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:53.900
with each other users, to find
influencers, for example, to understand

100
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.720
who are the main users leading to
the conversation about a particular topic.

101
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.550
Or, who do people pay attention to?

102
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.020
This information can be used to
identify the fewest number of

103
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.990
people with the greatest influence.

104
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.830
For example, for political campaigns,
or marketing on social media.

105
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.680
This code shows some operations for

106
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.210
connectivity analysis on neo4j using
the query language, Cypher, again.

107
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.660
The first operation finds the degree
of all the nodes in a graph,

108
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.450
and the second creates a histogram
of degrees for all nodes in a graph

109
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:35.990
to determine how connected a node in
a graph is, we need to look at its degree.

110
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.860
The degree of a node is the number
of edges connected to the node.

111
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.250
A degree histogram shows the distribution
of node degrees in the graph and

112
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.330
is useful in comparing graphs and
identifying types of users, for

113
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.410
example, those who follow, versus those
who are followed in social networks.

114
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.970
To summarize and add to these techniques,
the decision tree algorithm for

115
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.470
classification and k-means algorithm for
cluster analysis that we covered in this

116
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.040
lecture are techniques
from machine learning.

117
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:15.650
Machine learning is a field of analytics
focused on the study and construction of

118
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:20.819
computer systems that can learn from data
without being explicitly programmed.

119
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.540
Our course on machine learning in
this specialization will cover these

120
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.230
algorithms in more detail,
along with other algorithms used for

121
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.660
classification and cluster analysis.

122
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.690
As well as algorithms for
other machine learning tasks,

123
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.360
such as regression,
association analysis, and tools for

124
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.480
implementing and
executing machine learning algorithms.

125
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.130
As a summary of the Graph Analytics,
the Path Analytics technique for finding

126
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.390
the shortest path and the connectivity
analysis technique for analyzing communities

127
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:58.260
that we discussed earlier,
are techniques used in graph analytics.

128
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:02.970
As explained earlier,
graph analytics is the field of analytics,

129
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.520
where the underlying data is structured or
can be modeled as a set of graphs.

130
00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:13.200
Our graph analytics course in the
specialization will cover these and other

131
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.174
graph techniques, and we'll also cover
tools and platforms for graph analytics.

132
00:10:18.174 --> 00:10:25.610
In summary, analytic operations
are used to discover meaningful

133
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:31.115
patterns in the data in order to provide
insights into the problem being studied.

134
00:10:31.115 --> 00:10:36.635
We looked at some of the examples of
analytical operations for classification,

135
00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:41.355
cluster analysis, path analysis and
connectivity analysis in this lecture.
