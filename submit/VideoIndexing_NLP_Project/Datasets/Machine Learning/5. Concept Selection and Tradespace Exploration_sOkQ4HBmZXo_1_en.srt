PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
situate ourselves where we are.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,550
So we're starting to really
make a lot of progress

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,859
here, moving in the V model.

13
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:38,240
Today's topic is session
five: tradespace exploration,

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,219
concept selection, and PDR--

15
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:41,439
preliminary design review.

16
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,169


17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,690
So there's a lot to
talk about, and I'm

18
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,659
going to go relatively
quickly through this.

19
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:51,879
So, first I want to talk
about decision analysis.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,960
Fundamentally, when
you come up for PDR,

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,469
you have to make a big decision
which is, what concept are you

22
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:00,219
going for?

23
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:02,344
What is your system
architecture?

24
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:03,259
That's a big decision.

25
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,719
You don't have all
the details yet.

26
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,120
The design is not
fully done, but you've

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,980
chosen your key architecture.

28
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,719
That's a big
decision, and there's

29
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,510
a whole branch of research
and science called

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,790
decision analysis.

31
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,359
So I want to tell
you about that.

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,650
Talk about some of the issues
in concept selection, and then

33
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,690
give you some tools
for doing that

34
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,549
in a kind of organized way.

35
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,719
There's a couple of--

36
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:29,829
what I would say, simple methods
Pugh matrix and multi-attribute

37
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,060
utility--

38
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,519
that are relatively, I
think, straightforward.

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,810
And then there's a bit more
advanced concept called

40
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,939
non-dominance--

41
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:44,049
Pareto frontiers, getting into
multi-objective optimization.

42
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,019
And so, at a minimum, when
you choose your concept,

43
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:49,629
you want to choose a
non-dominated concept.

44
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,530
And I'll explain
what that means.

45
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,750
And then we'll close with
discussing what is a PDR?

46
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,159
What do you do with the PDR?

47
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:59,560
What's the purpose of it?

48
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,320
So, here is another way to
explain essentially the flow

49
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,879
of things as we come up to PDR.

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,400
So the way you can
think of it as, you

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,960
start with a need, right?

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,110
And your requirements.

53
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,590
That's-- we've talked
about that before.

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,270
And then you have
this creative phase,

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,950
which we talked about
last time, right?

56
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:24,209
You come up with a lot of
ideas, a lot of concepts,

57
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,500
and the funnel that you
see here is going up.

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,729
So each of these shapes here--

59
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,849
the circle, the triangle--

60
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,639
they're meant to represent
fundamentally different

61
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,409
concepts, different
architecture,

62
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,780
different way of satisfying
the requirements.

63
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,750
And so there's a lot of
different things you can do,

64
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,340
and the funnel opens up.

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,569
This is sort of the size
of options or alternatives

66
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,889
you're considering.

67
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,729
And then you have
to filter this down.

68
00:02:53,729 --> 00:02:56,000
In the end, you can only
build one system, right?

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,319
You have to choose
one architecture.

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,479
And this filtering down
happens typically in two steps.

71
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,769
One is what we call
concept screening, which

72
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,380
is more qualitative.

73
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:10,259
And then the actual
concept selection

74
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,329
is more quantitative, based
on models, based on data,

75
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,990
based on metrics.

76
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,350
And then you arrive at PDR.

77
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,250
So in this sort of
simplified view,

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:25,250
we've chosen the
square as our concept.

79
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,629
And we've made that
decision by looking

80
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:29,620
at these different metrics.

81
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,580
So you can see that
on this graphic here,

82
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,510
we have metric one, metric two--

83
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,829
you can see the triangle
is dominated, right?

84
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,020
The triangle doesn't
do as well if we

85
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,469
want to maximize
metric one and two,

86
00:03:42,469 --> 00:03:44,789
so it wouldn't make sense
to choose the triangle.

87
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:50,069
But the circle and the square--

88
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:52,889
circle does better on
metric two, but less well

89
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:53,819
on metric one.

90
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,859
The square does better on
metric one, not quite as well--

91
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,870
and they crossover
at some point.

92
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,740
So, whatever-- how you weigh
this in decision making,

93
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,120
the decision is made.

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,710
We're going to go
for the square.

95
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,180
That's our concept.

96
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,620
And then you move to the
actual system design, post-PDR,

97
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,750
which is all the details.

98
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,350
So we're expanding the box
now, the square, and designing

99
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,790
all the details within--

100
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,300
the structure, the avionics,
the software, the controls.

101
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,079
And that's design
modeling and optimization.

102
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,259
And so here I'm showing you
metric three, which is maybe

103
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,250
another metric, and then
design variable x1, which

104
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,189
is some pretty detailed
decision that you

105
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,230
make within that
concept, and you're

106
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,470
looking for the optimal, in this
case, minimizing metric three.

107
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,970
It's this point here.

108
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,470
And then that gives
you your-- and I

109
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,560
put this deliberately in
quotes-- optimal design.

110
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,680
That's what you show at the CDR,
and the critical design review,

111
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,490
and that's what
you go and build.

112
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,650
So that's roughly the
flow of decision making.

113
00:04:56,649 --> 00:04:58,019
Any question about that?

114
00:04:58,019 --> 00:04:59,979
That general flow?

115
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,280
So what we'll talk about
today is essentially

116
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,549
this portion here,
concept screening

117
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,420
and concept selection.

118
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:13,110
So, since you make a decision,
what is decision analysis?

119
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,900
So decision
analysis, in general,

120
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,349
is methods and tools
for ranking and choosing

121
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,280
among competing alternatives
or courses of action.

122
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,079
And I just want to make--

123
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,269
the word alternative.

124
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:29,359
A lot of people use the
word option and alternative

125
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,670
sort of as synonyms.

126
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,431
They're not.

127
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:32,930
OK?

128
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,009
They're not.

129
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:36,360
Options and alternatives
are not the same thing.

130
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,250
An alternative means if I choose
A, I can't choose B and C.

131
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,639
But the fact that you've
chosen A, or the square,

132
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,870
or whatever your concept is,
means that you cannot choose

133
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,310
the other ones.

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,884
An option means, well
given that I've chosen A,

135
00:05:56,884 --> 00:06:00,349
I could also add something
on top of A, right?

136
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,720
It's kind of like if you
were buying a new car,

137
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,310
are you going to get the
winter package or not?

138
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,579
That's an option, but you've
chosen a particular vehicle.

139
00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:11,389
So, that's important.

140
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,069
So alternatives are mutually
exclusive choices or courses

141
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:16,709
of action.

142
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,229
So you need the
alternatives, those

143
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,670
are the components-- four
components of a decision.

144
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,569
You need criteria, which means
how are you going to evaluate

145
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,610
and compare the alternatives?

146
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,350
Then you need value judgments.

147
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,980
You now apply the criteria
to the alternatives

148
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,140
to compare them,
and then finally you

149
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,909
need a decision
maker, which is either

150
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,120
an individual or a
group with preferences

151
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,980
to then make the choice.

152
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,280
Those are the four ingredients
of decision analysis.

153
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,759
And if we show this somewhat
graphically-- so here's

154
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,170
our alternatives.

155
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,310
We can do A, B, or C.
The criteria in this case

156
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,759
are cost, performance, and risk.

157
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,719
Then we basically evaluate,
in this case, option

158
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,470
or alternative A, I should
say, for cost, for performance,

159
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,370
for risk.

160
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,879
And this gives us
some score or number,

161
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:12,560
and then we need
to figure out a way

162
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,699
to combine this to
rank the alternatives.

163
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:18,649
And when it comes
to ranking, there's

164
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:21,679
a distinction between what's
known as an ordinal scale

165
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,540
and a cardinal scale.

166
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,410
So in an ordinal ranking all
you really care about and do

167
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,390
is say, what's the best
choice, the second best choice,

168
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,349
and the third choice.

169
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,980
You ordered the alternative.

170
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,580
But you don't know in an ordinal
ranking or ordinal scale,

171
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,909
whether one and two
are really close,

172
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,530
and then there's a big
gap between two and three.

173
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,659
You don't know that, and
you don't really care.

174
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,060
All you want is the rank order.

175
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,780
When you put things
on a cardinal scale--

176
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:54,829
so this is a continuous line--

177
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:58,219
you actually get, in a
sense, both the order

178
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,920
but you also see how close
the alternatives are.

179
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,350
So that's a cardinal scale as
opposed to an ordinal scale.

180
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,500
OK?

181
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
So-- yes?

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,129
Please.

183
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,420
AUDIENCE: How do you get a
discrete value for something

184
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,862
like risk or
something like that?

185
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,320
And especially in
an ordinal scale,

186
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,778
if you have two things that
are really close to each other,

187
00:08:17,778 --> 00:08:20,774
but the risk is kind of a
blurry region, how do you--

188
00:08:20,774 --> 00:08:22,939
PROFESSOR: So then they
would be equivalent in terms

189
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:24,500
of that criterion.

190
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,019
And you can actually
have ties, right?

191
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,539
You can have alternatives
that are tied.

192
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,240
And I'll talk
about-- this is one

193
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,830
of the issues in
concept selection

194
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,929
is, how do you do tie breaking?

195
00:08:35,928 --> 00:08:37,279
Good question.

196
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,899
Any questions at EPFL?

197
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,889
I know this is very abstract.

198
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,210
But fundamentally,
that's what we do.

199
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,370
Any questions over there?

200
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,335
Is it clear?

201
00:08:50,335 --> 00:08:51,627
AUDIENCE: Yes.

202
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:52,209
PROFESSOR: OK.

203
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,290
Good.

204
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:55,669
So let's keep moving.

205
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,679
So what are the issues?

206
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:59,556
I think that's-- so
multiple criteria,

207
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:00,639
how do you deal with them?

208
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,850
We usually have multiple
criteria and how do we--

209
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,970
and eventually, when you
make a decision, when

210
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,800
you pick a concept,
you're somehow

211
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,629
combining these criteria
into a single measure,

212
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,820
whether you're doing
that explicitly or not.

213
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,260
So how do you deal with
these multiple criteria?

214
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:19,879
We'll talk about that.

215
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,850
Here's the point
that you brought up.

216
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,110
What if there's ties?

217
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,970
How do you break them?

218
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,540
Group decision making versus
individual decision making--

219
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:30,909
who gets to really
make the decision?

220
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:31,779
Right?

221
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,569
And this relates to the
stakeholder analysis.

222
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,230
Who has the power to make
the decision in the end?

223
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,820
And then uncertainty-- did
we choose the right criteria?

224
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,520
Did we evaluate each
option properly?

225
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,539
And then the big one
is are the the best

226
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:51,549
alternatives represented?

227
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,219
So you can choose
among A, B, and C,

228
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,610
but maybe there's this much,
much better architecture

229
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,870
concept D out there, but
it's not in the decision set.

230
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,299
Because it didn't--
nobody thought of it,

231
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,689
or some other thing happened,
and it didn't come up

232
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,140
in concept generation.

233
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:09,639
Right?

234
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,741
So there's a lot
of uncertainties

235
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:12,699
when you're doing this.

236
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,440
So you have to be aware of it.

237
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,900
So let me talk about two--

238
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:23,139
again, quote, end
quote-- "simple methods"

239
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:24,639
for doing concept selection.

240
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,399
The first one is
called Pugh matrix,

241
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,439
and then I'll talk
about utility analysis.

242
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,520
So the Pugh matrix, essentially,
is a very discrete method.

243
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,669
It uses essentially plus, zero,
and minus to score alternatives

244
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,439
relative to a datum.

245
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,950
A datum is a reference decision,
a reference architecture.

246
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,600
And this is named
after Stuart Pugh,

247
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,060
who is a British professor
of design, essentially.

248
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,359
And it's a very simple method.

249
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,820
And it's used extensively.

250
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,820
It does have some pitfalls, as
well, but it's very well known.

251
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,470
So Pugh matrix

252
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,830
And then the second one is
called utility analysis.

253
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,670
So it essentially
maps all the criteria

254
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,439
to a dimensionless utility,
this is between zero and one.

255
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,240
So zero is a completely
useless system.

256
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,090
It has zero utility.

257
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,360
And one is a system that
has perfect utility.

258
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,009
It can't really be improved.

259
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:32,559
You could try to improve
it but your satisfaction

260
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,959
would not increase, OK?

261
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,160
And this has very deep
mathematical theory,

262
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,360
particularly the Von
Neumann and Morgenstern

263
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,029
utility that was
basically developed

264
00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:53,000
in the mid-twentieth century.

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,419
Anybody seen the movie
A Beautiful Mind?

266
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:57,919
Yeah?

267
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,459
What is is A
Beautiful Mind about?

268
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,412


269
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:09,519
AUDIENCE: It's about John--

270
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,509
mathematician John Nash who's
a mathematician who won--

271
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,129


272
00:12:16,129 --> 00:12:18,399
I forget exactly what
prize he had won.

273
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,683


274
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,100
PROFESSOR: He won
the Nobel Prize.

275
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,475
AUDIENCE: Was it
the Nobel Prize?

276
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:26,300
OK.

277
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,549
AUDIENCE: Founded game theory.

278
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:28,382
PROFESSOR: For what?

279
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,590
For game theory, right.

280
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,040
And so one of
Nash's contributions

281
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,120
was the idea of a
Nash equilibrium.

282
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,110
So we have multiple
decision makers in gaming,

283
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,460
and the question is--

284
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,519
you have your current
strategy, but is there

285
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,409
a better move you could make?

286
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,289
And if you could make
a better move that

287
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:52,279
improves your satisfaction,
or your utility,

288
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,589
but by doing this, you decrease
somebody else's utility,

289
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,480
you may not go there.

290
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,450
So if you reach a
Nash equilibrium,

291
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,980
that means that everybody
believes that this

292
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,139
is the best they can achieve.

293
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,740
And how do you measure that?

294
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,129
Well Nash actually developed
his Nash equilibrium and game

295
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:18,879
theory building upon theories
of Von Neumann and Morgenstern.

296
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,559
So there's a very
deep theory behind it.

297
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,449
I'm not going to go
very deep into it,

298
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,009
but so you know that there's
a lot behind utility analysis.

299
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,970
OK, so let me just talk
you through the basic steps

300
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,920
for doing a Pugh
matrix analysis.

301
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,500
And I'll show you a
very simple example.

302
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,289
First step, you choose
or develop the criteria

303
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,429
for comparison.

304
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:45,529
So, what's important?

305
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,470
How are we going to decide this?

306
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,610
Selection.

307
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,139
And obviously this
should be based

308
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:53,990
on a set of system
requirements and goals.

309
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,710
Now, there are two
flavors of requirements.

310
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,389
Remember, what-- let's
ask here at EPFL.

311
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,330
You remember the two
flavors of requirements?

312
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:07,921
What were the two
flavors of requirements?

313
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:19,712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

314
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:21,919
PROFESSOR: I mean, there's
actually six types, right?

315
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,099
There's functional requirements.

316
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,850
There is constraints.

317
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:31,360
There's interface
requirements, and so forth.

318
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,180
What I'm trying to get at
is there are requirements

319
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:36,009
that use shall
statements and then

320
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:39,309
there's requirements that
use should statements, right?

321
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:41,409
So the shall
statements are what?

322
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:43,194
What do the shell
statements imply?

323
00:14:43,195 --> 00:14:47,304


324
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,911
AUDIENCE: So basically, for
the shall, it's compulsory,

325
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:55,180
and for should, it's
a goal of the system.

326
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:56,199
PROFESSOR: That's right.

327
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:56,980
Exactly.

328
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,279
So, in some sense,
the shall state--

329
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,519
the criteria associated
with shall statements

330
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,960
don't necessarily make the best
criteria for the Pugh matrix,

331
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,129
because by definition, the
concepts that you're evaluating

332
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:14,769
should all satisfy
the shall statements.

333
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:19,029
Because if they don't, they're
essentially infeasible, right?

334
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:23,709
And you shouldn't select
among them in the first place.

335
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,430
So architectures, or
concepts, or alternatives

336
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:35,339
that violate shall requirements
do not satisfy the must

337
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,120
have requirements.

338
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,570
And you shouldn't-- so you
shouldn't use criteria that are

339
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,610
associated with
hard constraints.

340
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,769
That's what I'm trying to say.

341
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,840
Now the requirements
that are associated with

342
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,399
should statements, those are
good criteria for this Pugh

343
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,919
matrix, because the degree
to which you satisfy this,

344
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:57,019
the goals are somewhat variable.

345
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,539
Therefore, you can then
compare amongst alternatives.

346
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:00,399
OK?

347
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,329
So that's number one.

348
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,110
Number two-- thank
you, that was good--

349
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,159
select the alternatives
to be compared.

350
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,079
So that those are coming out
of concept generation and one

351
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,360
little bit tricky aspect here
is when you're putting together

352
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,779
the alternatives, the
concepts to be selected from,

353
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,789
they should be represented
at a similar level

354
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,069
of detail of abstraction.

355
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:28,840
It is not good to have one
concept that's really detailed,

356
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,639
and you know a lot
about it, and often it's

357
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,639
kind of an existing system or
something you've done before,

358
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,439
and then there's this other
concept that is very fuzzy.

359
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,560
Why shouldn't you compare
something very detailed

360
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:45,819
with something very,
very poorly defined?

361
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:49,090
Why do you think that's
not a good practice?

362
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,780
What do you guys think here?

363
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,049
Yes.

364
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,439
AUDIENCE: Is it like--

365
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,050
it's not fair, because--

366
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,049
PROFESSOR: That's right.

367
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,319
It's a fairness issue,
and because the concepts

368
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,550
that are poorly
defined often, you're

369
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:04,059
too optimistic about them.

370
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,559
That's sort of the typical--

371
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:09,098
this looks really
good, very promising,

372
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:11,500
but it looks very
promising because it's

373
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,318
kind of ill-defined.

374
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:15,318
So that's important.

375
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:17,348
Try to represent
all the concepts

376
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:19,509
at about the same
level of detail

377
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,009
when you make the comparison.

378
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,960
That's number two.

379
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,440
Number three-- you actually
go through and generate

380
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,880
the scores.

381
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,280
And the key thing
here-- this is maybe

382
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:32,559
the most important thing
about the Pugh matrix

383
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,250
is you always use a datum.

384
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:40,329
The datum is a reference--
one of the alternatives

385
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,220
that you're going to
compare is your reference.

386
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,559
So what you do is you always
compare every other alternative

387
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,549
in the set against the datum,
and you say for each criterion

388
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,289
is it better?

389
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,659
Is it about the
same, or is it worse

390
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:59,250
than the reference, the datum?

391
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,619
So you don't compare
all the alternatives

392
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,179
pairwise against each other.

393
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,590
You always compare
against the datum.

394
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:08,629
Then you compute
the total scores

395
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,300
and I'll show you
this in the example,

396
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,109
and then there's
variations like--

397
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:14,299
rather than better,
equal, or worse,

398
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,066
you could go to a five-point.

399
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,029
Much better, a little
better, or about the same.

400
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:21,980
So there are some
variations on the scoring,

401
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,804
but the classic method just
uses better, the same, or worse.

402
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:28,470
So here's some--

403
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,259
AUDIENCE: Excuse
me, just a question.

404
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:32,156
PROFESSOR: Yeah, go ahead.

405
00:18:32,156 --> 00:18:33,740
AUDIENCE: Just about
the number three,

406
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,269
about generic scores
and user datum--

407
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:39,496
by doing so, don't you exclude
a solution that could have,

408
00:18:39,496 --> 00:18:44,450
under the generic picture,
be better then others?

409
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,219
PROFESSOR: What do you
mean by general picture?

410
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,593
AUDIENCE: You should take all
the solution that you have,

411
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:53,279
and at the end, one performs
slightly better than the other,

412
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,819
but you couldn't spot
it by using the datum?

413
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:57,539
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

414
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,099
So it's a very good question.

415
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,549
And so this is a question
of resolution right?

416
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,149
How good is your resolution?

417
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,380
The main purpose
of the Pugh matrix

418
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,160
is not for making the
final choice right away.

419
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,930
The main purpose
of the Pugh matrix

420
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:17,750
is actually to eliminate
concepts that are--

421
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,130
you can tell already that
they're not competitive.

422
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,640
And you don't typically
do Pugh matrix one time

423
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,530
and then say that's
the best one.

424
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,105
You use it, essentially,
to eliminate

425
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:32,996
purely inferior solutions.

426
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:33,870
Does that make sense?

427
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:37,549


428
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:42,500
AUDIENCE: I'm really sorry
but the video cut just

429
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,640
during your explanation.

430
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,060
PROFESSOR: OK, so
let me repeat this.

431
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,929
So the purpose of
the Pugh matrix

432
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,750
is not to select
the final concept

433
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,119
as a result of doing
the Pugh matrix,

434
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,509
but to identify
inferior concepts

435
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,099
to eliminate them from the set.

436
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:06,269


437
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:07,789
OK?

438
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:08,625
AUDIENCE: OK.

439
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,500
PROFESSOR: All right.

440
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,460
So here's a kind
of generic example

441
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,039
to explain how this works.

442
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,089
So here's our Pugh matrix,
our evaluation matrix.

443
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:22,819
On the rows, we
have our criteria.

444
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:30,679
It could be cost, performance,
resilience, effectiveness,

445
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,890
and so those are called
A, B, C, D, E, and F.

446
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:36,920
So we have six criteria.

447
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,029
And then the column--

448
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,259
each column
represents a concept,

449
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:42,379
a design, an architecture.

450
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,090
And so you know
we're designing--

451
00:20:44,089 --> 00:20:46,639
I guess we're designing
beams here, or levers,

452
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,210
or something like that.

453
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,789
So this is a solid cylinder.

454
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,220
This is a cylinder
that's hollow.

455
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,500
This is a square,
it's cross-sectioned.

456
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,645
This is a triangular
cross-section.

457
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:57,769
You get the picture, right?

458
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:01,009
There they're
qualitatively different.

459
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:05,359
And then you note which one
is our is our reference here?

460
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,369
Which concept?

461
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:09,509
Number seven, right?

462
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:16,140
If you look at seven this
sort of shallow triangle.

463
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,520
Seven, it says datum.

464
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:19,039
You see that?

465
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,139
Which means that
this is our baseline,

466
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,180
our reference, our datum.

467
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,930
And then what you do is,
as you fill this in--

468
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:29,360
and you can do it two ways.

469
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:35,209
You can do-- pick, say, concept
one, the solid cylinder,

470
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,230
and then compare it against
seven for all criteria.

471
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:45,650
So A, so concept one is better
than concept seven in criterion

472
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,150
A. So it gets a plus.

473
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,820
It's also better in
B. It gets a plus.

474
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:55,189
It's worse in C and D, so this
is a minus compared to seven,

475
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,039
and so forth.

476
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,849
So the two ways of
filling it in is

477
00:21:58,849 --> 00:22:01,819
you do concept by
concept, column-wise,

478
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,329
or you can do it row- wise.

479
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:09,569
And there's some arguments
in favor of one or the other.

480
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:12,649
But essentially, you
fill in this matrix

481
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,390
by always comparing
against number seven.

482
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,117
Alexis, what's your question?

483
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just a question.

484
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:22,273
Shouldn't we weight
the criteria?

485
00:22:22,272 --> 00:22:26,889
I mean, for example, if the
criteria A is more important,

486
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,440
shall we put more weight on it?

487
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,610
PROFESSOR: No.

488
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:30,449
No.

489
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,600
At this point, in
the Pugh matrix,

490
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,669
the criteria are unweighted.

491
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,410
This is very important.

492
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,900
You don't say B is
twice as important as C.

493
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,830
They're unweighted
when you first do this.

494
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,319
Eventually, when you
do the final selection,

495
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:48,119
you will probably weigh them.

496
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,709
But when you first do
this, there's no weighting.

497
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,319
They're equal.

498
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:52,929
OK?

499
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,430
Yes?

500
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,394
Go ahead.

501
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:56,519
AUDIENCE: Are there any
rules in picking your datum

502
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:58,230
or do you just pick arbitrarily?

503
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,740
PROFESSOR: So I'll
get into that.

504
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,039
It should be a design that
you think is competitive,

505
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,139
that [INAUDIBLE]
maybe you know it,

506
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,110
maybe it's an existing
sort of system,

507
00:23:12,109 --> 00:23:16,613
there's data on it,
a known quantity.

508
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:18,029
But if you don't
have if you don't

509
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:20,019
have any information,
if they're all equal,

510
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,319
then it's a random choice.

511
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:22,980
OK?

512
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,670
So, then once you've
filled in this matrix--

513
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,190
so S here is for same, right?

514
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,509
About the same.

515
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:33,464
Then you essentially
sum all the pluses,

516
00:23:33,464 --> 00:23:36,599
you sum all the
minuses, and then

517
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:39,819
you have the net
result, unweighted.

518
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,319
Right?

519
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,649
So, here you can
essentially compare

520
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:47,820
that, you can see that
concept one is better in three

521
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:51,899
and worse in three
than the datum.

522
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,810
You can see that concept
two is inferior in three

523
00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:01,179
criteria, better in two,
and the same in one.

524
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,180
But we're not actually summing.

525
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,980
We're not actually
summing at this point,

526
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,259
because we're not
weighting these, OK?

527
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,309
But it gives you a
basis of understanding.

528
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,049
OK so let's do a quick
partner exercise.

529
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:18,240
What do you see as
the main advantages

530
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,960
and potential disadvantages
or pitfalls of this method?

531
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,029
So turn to your partner,
discuss this for a few minutes,

532
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,316
and then we'll see
what you came up with.

533
00:24:29,316 --> 00:24:31,220
[MICROPHONE NOISE]

534
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:54,900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

535
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,790
PROFESSOR: All right.

536
00:24:55,789 --> 00:24:56,288
Good.

537
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:59,379
So let's see advantages.

538
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,020
Let's get a couple
here, and then we'll

539
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:03,569
sort of go back and forth
between here and EPFL.

540
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,700
So what are-- what's
good about this method?

541
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,819


542
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,098
Yes, go ahead.

543
00:25:11,098 --> 00:25:12,639
AUDIENCE: So, Nate
and I were talking

544
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,600
that it is a relatively simple
decision making process.

545
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,379
So instead of just going with
some sort of gut feeling,

546
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,830
or not looking at everything,
you can get stuff down on paper

547
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,016
and actually see
these criteria and how

548
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:26,100
they relate to each other.

549
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:26,829
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

550
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,049
So simplicity.

551
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:28,944
What else?

552
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,429
Go ahead, Sam.

553
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,320
AUDIENCE: It allows you to look
at a large array of concepts

554
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,049
very quickly.

555
00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:39,579
PROFESSOR: OK large samples.

556
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:44,309


557
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,917
Sorry.

558
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:46,529
Quick, right?

559
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:47,619
You said quick.

560
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:48,119
.

561
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,139
OK.

562
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,090
What advantages, EPFL, what
did you guys come up with?

563
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,375
So simple, it allows us to
look at a lot of concepts.

564
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,809
It's quick.

565
00:25:55,809 --> 00:25:56,309
What else?

566
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:59,585


567
00:25:59,585 --> 00:26:03,309
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we got
[INAUDIBLE] the same things.

568
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:08,794
This method is simple, and
it's pretty fast and pretty

569
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:09,670
straightforward, too.

570
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:16,281
So this is a good way to get
rid of some of the concepts

571
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:16,779
pretty fast.

572
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:17,410
PROFESSOR: OK.

573
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:22,150
Anything else that we
didn't [INAUDIBLE]??

574
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,460
There's one more that I would
like to put on this list.

575
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,524
Veronica, go ahead.

576
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,869
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

577
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:29,509
PROFESSOR: Qualitative.

578
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:39,140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I kind of
like [INAUDIBLE] improvements,

579
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:44,060
rather than this is better
because the requirement is--

580
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:46,029
AUDIENCE: Please put
on the microphone.

581
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,960
PROFESSOR: I think-- can you
just quickly repeat that?

582
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,860
AUDIENCE: Just that
it's qualitative.

583
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:54,379
PROFESSOR: And that you see
that as an advantage, actually.

584
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,870
AUDIENCE: I think you
can see it both ways.

585
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:56,699
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

586
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,870
So I think what you implied
with is it stimulates

587
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,801
the discussion, right?

588
00:27:02,801 --> 00:27:03,906
Stimulates debate.

589
00:27:03,906 --> 00:27:08,175
AUDIENCE: There may be another
criterion on the positive side.

590
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:09,712
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

591
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:14,099
AUDIENCE: And it would be that
it's extremely easy to explain

592
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,002
to [INAUDIBLE],, to [INAUDIBLE],,
to whoever your customer is,

593
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,894
because-- and they
can relate to it.

594
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:24,089
If the criteria are mostly
physical or scientific, I mean,

595
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,480
larger, stronger,
lighter, cheaper,

596
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,750
it's probably very
intuitive, yes, as I say.

597
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,329
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

598
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:34,179
Now, downsides.

599
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,509
What are the downsides
of the method?

600
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:39,390
Go ahead.

601
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,060
Make sure you--

602
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,690
AUDIENCE: I think it
definitely depends

603
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,210
on which you pick as a datum.

604
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,869
Like, if you pick the clearly
best one as the datum,

605
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,909
then it's not going to
give you much information.

606
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,955
Or if you pick the worst one
as the datum, then all of them

607
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:54,579
will be better.

608
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:57,669
And you kind of don't
really gain much information

609
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,430
from that.

610
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,305
So you have to like iterate
with different datums.

611
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:01,930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

612
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,610
There's actually
research on this.

613
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:06,819
There's some research-- this
matrix, this Pugh matrix

614
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:09,579
method, by the way,
has been studied

615
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:11,299
scientifically quite a bit.

616
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:12,909
There's quite a
literature on it.

617
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,370
And the point that you
brought up was studied.

618
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,549
They would basically
give the same criteria

619
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:21,460
and the same alternatives to
different groups of people,

620
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,880
but then give them
a different datum.

621
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,130
And it's a little tricky--
is the result different

622
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,870
because it's a
different group dynamic?

623
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:33,689
Or is it-- but this has
been done statistically,

624
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,299
and the choice of datum has
an impact on the outcome.

625
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,319
Very good.

626
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,450
That's actually a
pretty subtle point.

627
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:42,009
That was excellent.

628
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,829
What are some other--
yes, please go ahead.

629
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:47,139
AUDIENCE: While it's
very easy to implement

630
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,509
and anyone can do it,
it is very subjective.

631
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:53,200
So if you have
somebody that doesn't

632
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,819
have a whole lot of
experience in a certain area,

633
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,289
they may get a completely
different answer

634
00:29:00,289 --> 00:29:02,591
than somebody who
is an expert looking

635
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,800
at the same type of criteria.

636
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:08,069
PROFESSOR: Subjectivity-- which
basically, repeatability--

637
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:09,339
may be low, right?

638
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:11,889
You want to have robustness
of the methods such

639
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,590
that if you repeated
this multiple times

640
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:17,019
or you gave it to
different groups of people,

641
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:20,230
you want to have some confidence
that the results will come up

642
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,250
similarly.

643
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,509
Very good.

644
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:25,900
Let's see at EPFL,
any downsides?

645
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,680
So datum dependent, subjective--

646
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,365
what else?

647
00:29:31,365 --> 00:29:32,740
AUDIENCE: So what
we are thinking

648
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,910
is that the criteria
depend, from group to group.

649
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,490
It doesn't seem to be clearly
defined what you need.

650
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,259
Although, there are some
that are straightforward

651
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:47,318
and our other point--

652
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,443
AUDIENCE: Datum dependence?

653
00:29:48,443 --> 00:29:49,109
That's what we--

654
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:52,319
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
datum dependence.

655
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:58,750
If it was a very easy solution,
or if a very bad solution

656
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,019
as a reference, then all
the others look good.

657
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:04,440
And finally, if you have a--

658
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,850
if you judge on the
overall concept,

659
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,639
and maybe you discard
one or two solutions,

660
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,620
but inside those
concepts you have ideas

661
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:22,119
that you could keep or use,
then they might be lost.

662
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,599
PROFESSOR: OK, so
loss of sub-concepts.

663
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,759
OK.

664
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:27,359
Good.

665
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,689
Anything else here?

666
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,207
Mike.

667
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,290
AUDIENCE: We were talking
about how it's very easy

668
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:35,109
to tune your metrics to be--

669
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,021
like to be biased.

670
00:30:36,021 --> 00:30:36,730
PROFESSOR: I see.

671
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,980
Such gaming, right?

672
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,019
Gaming-- gaming the--

673
00:30:41,019 --> 00:30:45,639
basically producing a matrix to
give you the answer you want,

674
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,509
that you already had
preordained, sort of.

675
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:48,009
Right?

676
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,450
That essentially
what you're saying.

677
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:50,950
.

678
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,230
OK.

679
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,789
Very good.

680
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:54,250
So these are all--

681
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:54,750
go ahead.

682
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,306


683
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:59,610
AUDIENCE: Just sort of
one last disadvantage

684
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:02,879
of the method that I think
is a bit interesting,

685
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,510
because I think the way
of grading everything with

686
00:31:06,509 --> 00:31:09,329
plus or minus can be
[INAUDIBLE],, because you can

687
00:31:09,329 --> 00:31:13,891
imagine a system, for instance,
that is very, very good in one

688
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:17,549
criteria, and then pretty
bad in all the others,

689
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:19,930
and it could be a
good concept that

690
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,410
is disregarded nonetheless.

691
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:25,050
PROFESSOR: What's your name?

692
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,799
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

693
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,536
PROFESSOR: Pasqual?

694
00:31:28,536 --> 00:31:29,490
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

695
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,280
PROFESSOR: Pasqual.

696
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,365
Is your name Pasqual?

697
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,115
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

698
00:31:32,115 --> 00:31:33,265
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]?

699
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:34,690
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

700
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,860
PROFESSOR: OK.

701
00:31:36,859 --> 00:31:38,809
Keep that point
until-- we're going

702
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:42,319
to talk about exactly that point
when it comes to non-dominance,

703
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,429
OK?

704
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:47,060
So please reserve--
this is great.

705
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:50,419
Just, we'll come back to
that in a few minutes, OK?

706
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,789
All right, so this is great.

707
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:54,710
I think you really got it.

708
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:58,309
This is exact-- this
is a very good list.

709
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:01,819
So, you may say well, OK
this is good for beams

710
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,779
and you know very simple things.

711
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,599
So, I want to show
you an example

712
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,079
of an application of the Pugh
matrix to what I would argue

713
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,669
is a fairly complex
architectural decision.

714
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,820
And what I'll talk to
you about is a thesis

715
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:21,899
that was done here at MIT
in 2003, so a while ago,

716
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,950
12 years ago, by Brian Smith.

717
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,019
He was an STM student, and was
one of the easiest students

718
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,460
ever to advise.

719
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,230
Very knowledgeable in nuclear
propulsion and nuclear power.

720
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:39,710
He's now the branch chief
for nuclear power propulsion

721
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,670
at NASA Glenn research
center in Ohio.

722
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,789
And so, at the time,
NASA had a mission

723
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:50,420
that was kind of high
priority called JIMO--

724
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,789
Jupiter icy moons mission.

725
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:55,730
And when you go out
to Jupiter, and you

726
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,950
want to not just do a
fly by but you actually

727
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,990
want to go to
different orbits, you

728
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,240
want to do high power imaging,
you need a lot of power.

729
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,049
You're far from the sun.

730
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:08,869
RTG's only give you 100
watts or so, per RTG.

731
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:12,776
So nuclear power is
pretty much the way to go.

732
00:33:12,777 --> 00:33:14,360
But there's a lot
of different choices

733
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,639
of different nuclear
reactor architectures

734
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,770
that would potentially--

735
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,319
and then couple that with
the propulsion system.

736
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:26,829
So that was the challenge was
sifting through the large space

737
00:33:26,829 --> 00:33:29,679
of possibility for
nuclear electric power,

738
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,620
nuclear exploration class
electric power and propulsion

739
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,699
systems.

740
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,350
And you know, here's the
way the study was set up

741
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,899
is the expansion phase,
the filtering, and then

742
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,620
the screening phase.

743
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,309
So here's the architectural
space the way it was defined.

744
00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:51,480
So nuclear electric power and
propulsion is what we're after.

745
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,069
And there's different ways to
generate these alternatives.

746
00:33:55,069 --> 00:33:57,689
So the most important
is the design vector,

747
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,200
the type of reactor, the
operating temperature,

748
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,779
the power conversion scheme,
the heat exchange, and then

749
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:04,339
the fuel type.

750
00:34:04,339 --> 00:34:06,789
And then there
were requirements.

751
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,039
So this is the power range,
the delivery timeline,

752
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,070
the fact that you should be able
to do it in a single launch,

753
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,630
and then the operational
lifetime of the system.

754
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,579
So those are the
shall requirements.

755
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,989
Every architecture had to meet
these requirements otherwise

756
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,550
it would not be considered.

757
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,173
And then there were some things
that were assumed as constants.

758
00:34:25,173 --> 00:34:27,110
They're shown here.

759
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,940
There was a policy
vector in terms

760
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,909
of funding profiles,
international partnerships,

761
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:36,260
at what altitude you could
insert the system into orbit,

762
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,030
and then influence
on future missions.

763
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,730
And the objective vector is
the criteria for the decision.

764
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,079
Technology-- TRL is
Technology Readiness Level.

765
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:46,799
How much infrastructure
do you need?

766
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,659
Complexity.

767
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,900
Strategic value to the nation.

768
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,099
This is a little fuzzy, but
basically what this means is,

769
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,250
could you use it for
other applications

770
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,579
than exploring Jupiter?

771
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:58,219
The schedule.

772
00:34:58,219 --> 00:34:59,430
The launch packaging.

773
00:34:59,431 --> 00:34:59,929
Power.

774
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:04,710
Specific mass, which
is watts per kilogram.

775
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,869
The lifetime.

776
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:09,679
So it's interesting you
have lifetime here and here.

777
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,039
So there's a minimum lifetime,
right, and if you satisfy this,

778
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:15,380
the extra life you
get can actually

779
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,750
be used as a decision criteria.

780
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,480
How does it interact
with the payload?

781
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,409
Do you need a lot of shielding?

782
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:22,730
And then adaptability?

783
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,510
Can you adapt it for
different missions?

784
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:25,010
Yeah?

785
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:30,051
AUDIENCE: In the previous
slide, it listed both possible--

786
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,369
on the previous slide, we had
both possible and feasible

787
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:37,409
on there as different
kind of criteria.

788
00:35:37,409 --> 00:35:39,629
What do you have for a
difference for those?

789
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,990
PROFESSOR: So essentially,
possible is, this

790
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:45,479
is sort of the
combinatorial space.

791
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,940
And then, applying
the hard constraints

792
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,639
based on the requirements
vector gets you

793
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:55,299
from possible to feasible.

794
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,920
They satisfy your must
have requirements,

795
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,960
your shall requirements,
and then you

796
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,699
use, in screening, you
use the objective vector--

797
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:10,119
these criteria-- you use
to go from here to here.

798
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,869
So let me show you
what this looks like,

799
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:15,210
and I'll post this thesis,
if you're interested.

800
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:20,110
It's really-- the whole thesis
is about doing this process.

801
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,599
So here we have--

802
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,469
each column represents a
different reactor architecture.

803
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:28,449
So you can see in the legend
what these things mean.

804
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:35,609
So for the reactor type, we
have a liquid metal, gas cooled,

805
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,670
or heat pipe type reactor.

806
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,360
These are three types of
nuclear fission reactors.

807
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,940
For fuel, we have two types of
fuel, if I remember correctly.

808
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,809
We have UO2 or UN.

809
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:52,079
For the temperature at which
the reactor would be run,

810
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,389
we have medium or high.

811
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:57,869
For the conversion-- this
is the thermodynamics.

812
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:00,449
How do you get the heat
out of the reactor?

813
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:03,960
We have a Brayton
or a Rankine cycle,

814
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,070
or a thermoelectric
reactor, which is basically

815
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,190
directly converting
the heat to electricity

816
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,710
without a working fluid.

817
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:20,820
And then, D is the heat
exchange architecture, which

818
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,190
is either direct or indirect.

819
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,099
And so you can see that
each of these columns

820
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,489
represents a different
kind of architecture,

821
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:32,939
and they're colored here by--

822
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:42,329
the dark is a direct heat pipe
with liquid metal reactor,

823
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,039
and so forth.

824
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,639
So that's essentially--
what you're seeing here

825
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,539
is the filtered set that
is deemed to be feasible.

826
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,429
Potentially feasible.

827
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:57,869
And then the actual screening
is done based on this.

828
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,789
So this is the actual
Pugh matrix here.

829
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:04,420
So we have the
concept combinations,

830
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,039
which are the columns.

831
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,150
The datum here is the one
that's shaded in gray.

832
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,349
So it's a liquid metal
reactor with a thermal--

833
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:16,769
it's a liquid metal
thermoelectric reactor

834
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:21,570
with indirect heat exchange, UN
fuel type and a high operating

835
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:22,950
temperature.

836
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:25,230
And why was this chosen?

837
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:30,000
Well if you look here,
it says SP100 reference.

838
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,449
So the US actually has
launched-- at least,

839
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,759
officially, as far as we know--

840
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,270
one nuclear reactor into
space, and that's the SP100.

841
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,070
You can look it up.

842
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,180
There's a history behind it.

843
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:46,949
And that's the
architecture of the SP100.

844
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,449
So it was launched.

845
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:49,679
We had data on it.

846
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,509
It's a known quantity.

847
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,580
The Russians, it turns out--

848
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,730
Russia has launched a
lot of nuclear reactors

849
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,550
over the years.

850
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:01,500
But this is sort
of the US baseline,

851
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,639
if you want to call it that.

852
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:05,879
And then all of these
other combinations

853
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,680
are compared against the
SP100, the reference reactor.

854
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:17,019
And so, you can see here that
the comparison is drawn again.

855
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:20,199
So zero means it's about--

856
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:23,439
so for TRL, it means it's
about equally mature.

857
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,139
A plus means it's
actually more mature.

858
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:30,719
A negative means it's less
mature than the SP100.

859
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,000
And at the end of
this, you can actually

860
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,619
look at the total pluses
and zeros and minuses,

861
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,259
and then in this
case, what Brian did,

862
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,600
he did calculate a net score.

863
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:44,130
That's an unweighted score.

864
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,510
Basically, if you give
one point-- so let's

865
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,020
look at the first one.

866
00:39:50,019 --> 00:39:53,259
So it has four pluses, right?

867
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:58,240
It has four pluses, and it
has five equal to the SP100,

868
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,349
to the datum, and has two minus.

869
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:03,339
So it's worse than two,
better in four criteria,

870
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,840
and the same in five.

871
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,630
So the net score
would be plus two,

872
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,769
because it's better
in two criteria, net.

873
00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:13,690
But it's unweighted.

874
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,980
And so in order to
figure out what--

875
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:21,880
based on this net score,
so a zero net score

876
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,599
would say it's about
equal to the datum,

877
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,440
but it maybe in other,
different criteria.

878
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,619
But essentially
it's about the same.

879
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:35,079
If it's a plus two, then
it is potentially better

880
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:36,309
than the SP100.

881
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,230
But you don't know
that 100%, because you

882
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,639
haven't weighted the criteria.

883
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:42,009
It's really used for screening.

884
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:47,950
So the ones that are circled
are better, essentially,

885
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:49,929
than the datum.

886
00:40:49,929 --> 00:40:51,710
And the ones that are--

887
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,409
this is-- I'm sorry, the rank.

888
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,969
This is the rank among the set.

889
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:59,289
So if you have a one here,
you're in the rank one.

890
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:03,489
And there's two architectures,
the first two are rank one.

891
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,049
And then we have
this architecture,

892
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,370
which is ranked two.

893
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:10,299
The datum itself, plus two other
architectures, are rank three.

894
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,800
And then you see
that there's some--

895
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,260
like, for example,
this architecture here

896
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,580
is rank eight, right?

897
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,349
So it-- why is that?

898
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:20,349
Because it's not better in
any criteria than the datum.

899
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,909
It's the same in six.

900
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,839
And it's worse in five, right?

901
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,980
So that gives you an indication
that this particular concept

902
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,570
probably is not very attractive,
and you would eliminate that.

903
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,640
OK?

904
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:40,089
So that's essentially an
application of the Pugh matrix

905
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:45,170
to a pretty real-world,
complex problem.

906
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,150
So what the Pugh matrix is for
is essentially structured--

907
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,059
structuring and representing
the evaluation procedure.

908
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:54,130
It serves as a common visual.

909
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,530
It provides some
amount of discipline,

910
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:59,470
and helps break down
self-sealing behavior,

911
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:00,519
meaning--

912
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,099
what that means is people
defending their concepts

913
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:05,500
without sort of seeing
the bigger picture.

914
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,130
Encourages teamwork.

915
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,369
It helps you eliminate
weaker ideas,

916
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,949
retain a set of
stronger concepts.

917
00:42:11,949 --> 00:42:14,000
And then this is
interesting-- divergence.

918
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,260
It helps to identify
opportunities for combination.

919
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:20,300
There's also a way to
use this Pugh matrix

920
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,301
methods multiple times.

921
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,799
And the way you
would do this is you

922
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,880
would say, OK so these are the
stronger concepts here, right?

923
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,670
The ones that do equally
well or maybe even

924
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,550
a little better than the datum.

925
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,200
What are the strengths and
weaknesses of each concept

926
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:37,210
and can we hybridize them?

927
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,329
Can we create some
hybrid concepts?

928
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:43,929
And so you eliminate
the weaker ones.

929
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,769
The surviving concepts are
kept, and then maybe hybridized

930
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:48,699
with each other.

931
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,000
So you expand and create
more concepts again.

932
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,559
Maybe a little
bit more detailed.

933
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,019
And then you apply
the Pugh matrix again.

934
00:42:56,019 --> 00:43:00,219
So it's iterative application
of the Pugh matrix, where

935
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:04,569
you eliminate, you keep strong
concepts, you hybridize them,

936
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,789
and then you repeat
it two or three times.

937
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,800
And there's actually
research on this, as well.

938
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,140
Professor Dan Frye,
who is here at MIT

939
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:14,259
in mechanical engineering,
has done research on that

940
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,050
and shown that that can actually
lead to very good outcomes.

941
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,870
So this sort of gradual--

942
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:23,739
so then, you don't have just
one expansion and contraction

943
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:28,059
of your concept space, but it
sort of goes multiple times.

944
00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:29,960
But eventually it does converge.

945
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,699
So this is a more refined
application of the method.

946
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:38,649
What Pugh matrix is not good for
is automatic decision-making,

947
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,389
right?

948
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,309
Completely controlling
the process.

949
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:47,809
So, you know, the idea of
automating the Pugh matrix--

950
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:49,659
it should not be automatic.

951
00:43:49,659 --> 00:43:51,460
And it's not really
done-- it's not

952
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,099
really good for trade studies.

953
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:58,460
Challenges-- [LAUGHS]
so here's some quotes.

954
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,349
"People who have a
lot of experience

955
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:02,630
exhibit an impatience.

956
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,880
Get on with it.

957
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,800
This procedure holds us back."

958
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:07,430
Right?

959
00:44:07,429 --> 00:44:10,159
"Strong-willed individuals
who have a lot of experience

960
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,309
and whose initial concepts
have not emerged in the final

961
00:44:13,309 --> 00:44:18,259
selection commence a defense
based on emotion, experience,

962
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,120
and bluster."

963
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:19,619
Right?

964
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,359
So there's this social dynamics
that gets unfolded here.

965
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,539
So, therefore, it is
recommended to do Pugh matrix

966
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:27,980
with a facilitator.

967
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,820
Somebody who-- similar
to brainstorming, right,

968
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:33,720
where you have a facilitator.

969
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,230
So you have a facilitator
for Pugh matrix.

970
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,300
So somebody who controls
the flow and pace

971
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,910
of the session,
records the results,

972
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:44,119
tries to maintain
some discipline.

973
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,889
Always compare
against the datum.

974
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:50,000
I've seen Pugh matrix sessions
where you start with the datum,

975
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,769
and then by the third
or fourth concept,

976
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,469
people are starting to
do pairwise comparisons,

977
00:44:54,469 --> 00:44:56,629
and the datum is sort of lost.

978
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,210
That should not happen, right?

979
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:02,449
Preventing tangents, but
encourage clarification.

980
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,000
What do we really
mean by criteria?

981
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,179
Clarification of the concepts,
and then opportunities

982
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:11,759
for divergence in hybrids.

983
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,319
So the critique
of the method is--

984
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,610
I think a lot of these things
you've already mentioned.

985
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:19,220
The ranking depends on
the choice of datum.

986
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,239
The weighting.

987
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:21,859
You know, there's
no real weighting

988
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,390
in the classic method.

989
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,931
However, you can implement a
weighted version of the Pugh

990
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,179
method, but then you have
to have the whole discussion

991
00:45:29,179 --> 00:45:33,349
about the weightings, a priori.

992
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,500
Next, I'm going to talk about
multi-attribute utility.

993
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,760
And so Pugh matrix and
multi-attribute utility

994
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,010
could give you a different
rank order of alternatives.

995
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,110
So how do you reconcile that?

996
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:48,079
The most important criteria
may be intangible and missing

997
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,650
from the list.

998
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,670
And my personal opinion on
this is that the Pugh matrix

999
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:54,840
is useful and simple to use.

1000
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,700
It stimulates discussion about
the criteria, the alternatives,

1001
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:02,480
but it shouldn't be your only
means of concept selection.

1002
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,250
But it's usually one
of the first things

1003
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:07,860
you should do because you
learn a lot from doing it.

1004
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,720
OK?

1005
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,919
Any questions about
matrix before I move on?

1006
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,690
Yes, Sam?

1007
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,130
AUDIENCE: Should
it always be done

1008
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,450
with a group that's working
together and discussing

1009
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,109
the concepts?

1010
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:24,410
Or could you also have
people individually

1011
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:27,170
filling them out and then
combining their results?

1012
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,650
PROFESSOR: So yeah, usually
you do it as a group

1013
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,410
because in the discussion
with the group,

1014
00:46:33,409 --> 00:46:36,139
there's a lot of
clarification that happens.

1015
00:46:36,139 --> 00:46:40,549
Now if you do it separately,
and you firewall people

1016
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:43,550
from each other and have people
do this individually and then

1017
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:48,140
try to combine the results
later, that's actually called--

1018
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:52,605
that's closer to a method
called the Delphi method.

1019
00:46:52,606 --> 00:46:54,230
Which I'm not going
to talk about here.

1020
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:56,490
But the Delphi
method means you're

1021
00:46:56,489 --> 00:47:01,069
asking these kinds of
questions to experts.

1022
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:04,519
They give you the answers, and
then you anonymize the answers

1023
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:08,210
and reflect the combined
answers back to the group.

1024
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:11,720
And then you eliminate
the social dynamics,

1025
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:15,589
and you can see whether was
my assessment an outlier,

1026
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,690
am I close to the
center of the group?

1027
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,550
So the Delphi method
has a lot of benefits,

1028
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,130
but it's not usually--

1029
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,680
you don't have
the social dynamic

1030
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:28,369
in the same way, which is sort
of essential to make this work.

1031
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:29,900
Good question though.

1032
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:33,510
Any questions at EPFL about
Pugh matrix before I move on?

1033
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,688


1034
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:37,823
AUDIENCE: No, it's clear.

1035
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:38,469
PROFESSOR: OK.

1036
00:47:38,469 --> 00:47:39,969
Go ahead.

1037
00:47:39,969 --> 00:47:44,000
AUDIENCE: It is useful to almost
have an independent group do

1038
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,880
this, as opposed to everyone
generates their ideas

1039
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,050
and then everyone's trying
to fill out the matrix so

1040
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:53,510
that their idea wins.

1041
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,780
PROFESSOR: Usually not,
because if you give it

1042
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,120
to an independent
group, they'd know

1043
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:00,409
much less about the problem.

1044
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:04,190
They probably weren't involved
in generating the alternatives,

1045
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,099
they weren't involved in
selecting the criteria.

1046
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,380
They're probably not
as knowledgeable.

1047
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,849
And so there is an advantage
of doing it within the team.

1048
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,369
But then, you know, before
you actually go and pull

1049
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,440
the trigger on the
final-- that's the PDR.

1050
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,619
You get vetted by
independent people.

1051
00:48:21,619 --> 00:48:24,299
That's what happens at the PDR.

1052
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,325
OK.

1053
00:48:25,324 --> 00:48:29,750
AUDIENCE: One point here is that
you can invite external people

1054
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,130
to join your discussion.

1055
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,980
So you have your design team.

1056
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,507
And it's very good to
have the experts to come,

1057
00:48:35,507 --> 00:48:38,299
sit in the meeting, and
then give their opinion,

1058
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,264
and with the Pugh
matrix, as it's

1059
00:48:40,264 --> 00:48:41,680
pretty straightforward
and simple,

1060
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:43,819
you probably shouldn't
then bias the result,

1061
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,487
but you could
probably enrich it.

1062
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:46,820
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

1063
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,559
I agree with that, [INAUDIBLE].

1064
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:49,159
Absolutely.

1065
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:50,359
Yeah.

1066
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:50,960
OK.

1067
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,860
So let's switch gears
to utility theory

1068
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,079
or multi-attribute
utility theory.

1069
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:58,710
So what's that all about?

1070
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,869
So like I said, utility is
a very deeply rooted concept

1071
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:04,609
in economics.

1072
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,190
And so it's defined
as, "Utility is

1073
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,059
a measure of relative
happiness, or satisfaction,

1074
00:49:11,059 --> 00:49:15,139
or gratification gained by
consuming different bundles

1075
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:16,469
of goods and services."

1076
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:18,469
This is sort of
economic-- very--

1077
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:21,559
this is how economists talk.

1078
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,039
So it's-- the idea is you
want to choose a concept

1079
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,219
or alternative that will
maximize your happiness,

1080
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:31,529
your satisfaction,
your gratification.

1081
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:36,620
And whenever you buy something,
when you go to Anna's Taqueria,

1082
00:49:36,619 --> 00:49:39,500
or wherever you guys have
lunch, or at EPFL you

1083
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:43,429
go to the Rowlock center,
and you pick from the menu,

1084
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:46,159
you're actually doing
just that, right?

1085
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,399
You have-- how much money
do I have in my pocket?

1086
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,369
How hungry am I?

1087
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,019
Am I a vegetarian or not?

1088
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:57,440
That would filter out some
menu items right away, right?

1089
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,720
And you pick, every day.

1090
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:01,339
You pick your lunch.

1091
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:03,249
Well, you're doing exactly this.

1092
00:50:03,248 --> 00:50:05,039
You don't really know
that you're doing it,

1093
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:09,019
but in your mind, as you're
picking from the menu,

1094
00:50:09,019 --> 00:50:10,880
and then making
your choice, you're

1095
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,539
maximizing your
utility at that moment.

1096
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:16,409
So we do this every day.

1097
00:50:16,409 --> 00:50:20,000
Here, in this class,
we talk about designing

1098
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,920
complex systems.

1099
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,159
So we need to do it a little
bit more deliberately,

1100
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:28,109
but this is not just
some abstract thing.

1101
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,750
We do this every day.

1102
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,699
And so the idea is, essentially,
we have this Consumption Set

1103
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,039
X, which are our
alternatives-- mutually

1104
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:39,079
exclusive alternatives--
and then we

1105
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,869
map that to the real scale.

1106
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:44,119
We rank each member of
the Consumption Set.

1107
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:48,109
So we map the alternatives
on this utility scale.

1108
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:52,130
In this case, the cardinal
scale between zero and one.

1109
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:54,690
So, the way this
is done, in order

1110
00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:00,059
to do the mapping from
the criteria to utility,

1111
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,190
you need these
mapping functions.

1112
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,349
And we call these
utility functions.

1113
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:06,179
They're called
utility functions.

1114
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,299
So basically we have--

1115
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,390
I'm going to use J here for--

1116
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:17,039
J means, essentially, your
attribute, your objective.

1117
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,289
And then U is your utility.

1118
00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:23,039
And so there are different
shapes of utility functions.

1119
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,750
And different scholars
call them differently.

1120
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,179
So this is Cook.

1121
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:30,079
He says, this is smaller is
better, or larger is better.

1122
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,940
And you see they're essentially
monotonically increasing

1123
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,769
or decreasing curves.

1124
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:39,449
Messac, another scholar
in multi objective design,

1125
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:42,569
calls this class 1S, class 2S.

1126
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:47,070
So what would be an
example of a smaller

1127
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:49,024
is better utility function?

1128
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:52,259


1129
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:54,300
What would be an
example of that?

1130
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:54,800
Go ahead.

1131
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,620


1132
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:01,259
AUDIENCE: An example would be
the weight of a launch vehicle.

1133
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,026
It's decreasing.

1134
00:52:03,025 --> 00:52:04,149
PROFESSOR: The launch mass?

1135
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,559
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1136
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:04,920
PROFESSOR: OK.

1137
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:05,510
Launch mass.

1138
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,720
OK.

1139
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:07,980
What about EPFL?

1140
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,099
Smaller is better.

1141
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:13,819


1142
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,780
AUDIENCE: Cost.

1143
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,120
PROFESSOR: Cost, right.

1144
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:19,250
So, larger is better?

1145
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:27,159


1146
00:52:27,159 --> 00:52:27,909
AUDIENCE: Revenue.

1147
00:52:27,909 --> 00:52:29,529
PROFESSOR: Revenue.

1148
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:36,269
Maybe range, endurance,
reliability, right?

1149
00:52:36,269 --> 00:52:40,019
Then there's-- the next one is
strictly concave or strictly

1150
00:52:40,019 --> 00:52:42,659
convex, which is
nominal is better.

1151
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:46,639
So the idea there is
there's a sweet spot, right?

1152
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:49,349
You want the performance
or the attribute

1153
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:53,159
to be a pretty specific
value, and if you

1154
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:58,199
deviate from that on
the up or down side then

1155
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:00,179
the utility decreases.

1156
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:03,659
So what would be
an example of that?

1157
00:53:03,659 --> 00:53:05,309
AUDIENCE: Size of a meal.

1158
00:53:05,309 --> 00:53:06,989
PROFESSOR: Size of a meal, OK?

1159
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:10,409
Well, some restaurants
may beg to differ, right?

1160
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:11,177
All you can eat.

1161
00:53:11,177 --> 00:53:11,676
[LAUGHS]

1162
00:53:11,677 --> 00:53:12,591
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what their objective is.

1163
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,409
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1164
00:53:13,409 --> 00:53:14,309
All right.

1165
00:53:14,309 --> 00:53:14,909
Very good.

1166
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:15,408
Yes, Sam?

1167
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
has to interface

1168
00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:20,042
with something else
[INAUDIBLE] you're not

1169
00:53:20,043 --> 00:53:22,860
[INAUDIBLE] it [INAUDIBLE].

1170
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:25,740
PROFESSOR: Yup, so if there
is a very specific interface

1171
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:26,359
condition.

1172
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,090
Yeah.

1173
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,240
OK, go ahead at EPFL.

1174
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:32,639
Nominal is better.

1175
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:34,789
AUDIENCE: Like, for example,
ambient temperature.

1176
00:53:34,789 --> 00:53:35,456
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1177
00:53:35,456 --> 00:53:37,920
So temperature-- ambient
temperature, right?

1178
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,579
Humans are pretty-- we have
a fairly narrow range where

1179
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:43,110
we say, this is good.

1180
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:45,150
Now we can put on a sweater or--

1181
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,500
but it's a fairly narrow range.

1182
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,650
So, great example.

1183
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,769
Then the next one
is range is better,

1184
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,090
which is concave or convex.

1185
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:59,670
So this is the idea that as long
as you're within this interval,

1186
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,260
within the interval itself,
you're sort of indifferent.

1187
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:03,760
Right?

1188
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,160
But then when you drop
outside the interval,

1189
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,279
then utility decreases
or increases.

1190
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,269
And then the last one is very
exotic-- non-monotonic utility

1191
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:15,519
functions that have
multiple peaks.

1192
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,340
They exist in theory, but in
practice, you almost never

1193
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:19,840
see them.

1194
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,289
I can't give you a good
example of multi-modal one.

1195
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:26,753
But in theory they do exist.

1196
00:54:26,753 --> 00:54:29,213
AUDIENCE: Well, there
is one, and it's clearly

1197
00:54:29,213 --> 00:54:30,804
the landing sites on a planet.

1198
00:54:30,804 --> 00:54:32,199
PROFESSOR: OK.

1199
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:35,259
AUDIENCE: Because you have
the one injection trajectory,

1200
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,710
and then you have the primary
sites of the primary elipse,

1201
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,480
then the secondary.

1202
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,010
And it's non-monotonic,
mostly [INAUDIBLE]..

1203
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,720
It doesn't go up, it goes down.

1204
00:54:46,719 --> 00:54:47,789
So you have ideal.

1205
00:54:47,789 --> 00:54:49,900
Then you are out of it.

1206
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,530
Then you would land on rocks.

1207
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,160
And then you have the next
plateau, and maybe a third one,

1208
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,103
on one pass by.

1209
00:54:56,103 --> 00:54:57,519
PROFESSOR: That's
an interesting--

1210
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,449
that's an interesting comment.

1211
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:03,549
I'm trying to figure out
what's the attribute-- what's

1212
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,890
the engineering attribute
that goes with that?

1213
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:09,525


1214
00:55:09,525 --> 00:55:12,549
AUDIENCE: Well, it's the
tolerance on the injection.

1215
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:14,550
I know that, at JPL--

1216
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,830
by the way, thanks for
organizing the [INAUDIBLE]----

1217
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:19,440
they made this
presentation, also,

1218
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,849
of the landing of the rovers.

1219
00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:23,679
And they have the
primary ellipse

1220
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:25,179
where they try to land--

1221
00:55:25,179 --> 00:55:29,859
well, try-- it
depends on the entry.

1222
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,800
And then they have secondary--
if they miss the entry,

1223
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,042
then they have very bad option.

1224
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,500
And then, maybe a
little bit later,

1225
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,369
they maybe can land
on the next plateau,

1226
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,699
or in the next crater,
which is useful.

1227
00:55:41,699 --> 00:55:46,601
So they have this non-monotonic,
but degrading, function.

1228
00:55:46,601 --> 00:55:47,559
The first time is best.

1229
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:48,807
The second would still work.

1230
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:51,480
But in between, there's
a part that doesn't go.

1231
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,760
PROFESSOR: OK.

1232
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,040
Got to think about that one.

1233
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:56,590
But that's an
interesting-- that's

1234
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:58,950
a pretty interesting example.

1235
00:55:58,949 --> 00:56:03,789
So, the main point here is that
in order to calculate utility,

1236
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:08,440
you need a translation function
between the engineering

1237
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:13,750
or financial attributes of
each alternative and utility.

1238
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,750
If it's not-- if it
was directly that,

1239
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,130
you'd just have a linear, right?

1240
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,470
It would be a 45
degree line, right?

1241
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:22,750
Or negative 45.

1242
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,039
But typically the mapping
from your attribute values

1243
00:56:27,039 --> 00:56:29,320
to the utility is non-linear.

1244
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,460
And that's what this says.

1245
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,519


1246
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,239
So then the challenge
is well, how do you

1247
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:38,769
get these utility functions?

1248
00:56:38,769 --> 00:56:40,400
Where do they come from?

1249
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,889
And the answer is you've
got to do interviews,

1250
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:44,199
you have to survey people--

1251
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:47,239
the decision-makers, the
stakeholders we talked about.

1252
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:49,419
They're the ones who
have these utility

1253
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,519
functions in their minds,
even if they're not--

1254
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:55,059
So you've got to
make those explicit.

1255
00:56:55,059 --> 00:56:56,599
So here's an example.

1256
00:56:56,599 --> 00:56:58,989
You may have three different
customers for your system.

1257
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:01,959
User attribute, some
performance attribute.

1258
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,610
Customer one is shown here.

1259
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,890
They need a minimum
amount of performance,

1260
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:11,589
but once you reach this
threshold, after that there's

1261
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,320
no more utility.

1262
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,269
But then customer two and
customer three are different.

1263
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:19,750
They want-- their utility
increases gradually,

1264
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:23,590
and in fact, customer three
doesn't see any much utility

1265
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:25,940
until you hit this
much higher level.

1266
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,929
So one of the challenges, then,
in designing these utility

1267
00:57:28,929 --> 00:57:33,159
functions when you have multiple
customers is to solicit this--

1268
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,179
and there's interview and survey
techniques for doing that--

1269
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:39,379
and then combining those.

1270
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,500
And then the other
challenge in combining

1271
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,590
them is that, remember
at the system level,

1272
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,980
utility is still between
zero and one, right?

1273
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,550
So if you had, for
example, two attributes,

1274
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:54,220
and they both give
you perfect utility,

1275
00:57:54,219 --> 00:57:59,399
and you add them together
you'd get a utility of what?

1276
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,849
You have two attributes.

1277
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:02,610
Two.

1278
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,690
But that can't be because the
total system utility can never

1279
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,039
be better than one.

1280
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:09,329
So you have to normalize.

1281
00:58:09,329 --> 00:58:11,099
As you combine
the utilities, you

1282
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:15,449
have to normalize them, and
actually weight them as well.

1283
00:58:15,449 --> 00:58:19,799
So here's the equation when
you have two utilities.

1284
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,030
You basically have the utility
of the system just from J1--

1285
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:28,470
your first attribute--
times the utility of J2.

1286
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:31,709
This is the mixed term,
right, the combined term.

1287
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:37,800
Plus the utility of just J1
plus the utility of just J2.

1288
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,910
Then you have this K factor
here-- this capital K factor--

1289
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:45,089
which re-normalizes
everything to zero and one.

1290
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,700
And if you have
more than two, then

1291
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:49,569
it becomes a matrix calculation.

1292
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,230
So it's a little tricky for
how to do this properly,

1293
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,269
but it's well-known
how to do this.

1294
00:58:54,269 --> 00:58:58,019
So the steps in multi-attribute
utility analysis

1295
00:58:58,019 --> 00:59:01,170
are to identify your
objectives and attributes,

1296
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:03,059
you develop an
interview questionnaire,

1297
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:05,039
you administer
that questionnaire.

1298
00:59:05,039 --> 00:59:08,039
You then develop your
aggregate utility functions,

1299
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:10,440
you determine the utility
of your alternatives,

1300
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,170
and then you
analyze the results.

1301
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,210
And there is one word of
caution I want to give you,

1302
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:18,119
which is that utility
is essentially

1303
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:21,000
the surrogate of value,
but value often we

1304
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,119
express in dollars,
in monetary terms.

1305
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:27,009
But utility is unit-less.

1306
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,980
So let me just comment
about utility maximization.

1307
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:34,025
It's very common and
generally well accepted.

1308
00:59:34,025 --> 00:59:36,910


1309
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:40,440
It's a non-linear combination
of your criteria-- your decision

1310
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:41,579
criteria.

1311
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,369
The downside of it is
the physical meaning

1312
00:59:44,369 --> 00:59:48,989
is often lost, because the
engineering or customer focused

1313
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:50,969
attributes all get combined.

1314
00:59:50,969 --> 00:59:54,959
So you say this system
has a utility 0.83,

1315
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,210
and this one has a utility 0.75.

1316
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,949
So one is better than the
other, but immediately you

1317
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:02,250
want to say well why is that?

1318
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,269
What does that mean?

1319
01:00:03,269 --> 01:00:06,360
So then you have to backtrack
and reverse engineer

1320
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,110
how those utilities
were calculated.

1321
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,510
You need to obtain a
mathematical representation

1322
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,850
for all utility functions, and--

1323
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:18,779
this is a probably not
just US-M centric comment,

1324
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,120
this is probably everywhere
in the world more or less--

1325
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,779
but the utility function can
vary drastically depending

1326
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,290
on the decision maker.

1327
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,340
This is a big issue in
government programs.

1328
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:32,769
So you guys, it's uniform
day, I guess, today.

1329
01:00:32,769 --> 01:00:35,550
So how long is a
typical tour of duty

1330
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,000
of a program manager in the
Pentagon for a big program?

1331
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,849
What would you say?

1332
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:44,773
AUDIENCE: It's usually
three to four years.

1333
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:47,190
PROFESSOR: So three to four
years, like it's written here.

1334
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:52,679
And what does that that mean
in practice for these utility

1335
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:53,960
functions and for programs?

1336
01:00:53,960 --> 01:01:01,090


1337
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:04,660
Sorry I'm putting
you on the spot here.

1338
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:08,319
AUDIENCE: Well,
you don't usually

1339
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,780
have a lot of overlap
between the PM.

1340
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:12,880
So, as one goes
out, another one's

1341
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,050
coming in, so you're
losing a lot of experience,

1342
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:20,789
gaining somebody who doesn't
have much experience.

1343
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:22,322
So there's a
learning curve here.

1344
01:01:22,322 --> 01:01:23,030
PROFESSOR: Right.

1345
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:27,759


1346
01:01:27,759 --> 01:01:28,300
That's right.

1347
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,980
What I'm getting at is--
so there's definitely that

1348
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,070
effect--

1349
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:34,580
but the priorities
may be different.

1350
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:38,619
You know, whereas the prior
program manager really valued

1351
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:44,409
a lot performance
or quick response,

1352
01:01:44,409 --> 01:01:47,589
and the next program manager--
because maybe the context has

1353
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:48,530
changed--

1354
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:51,150
is very, very cost conscious.

1355
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,500
Really wants a system that
is very, very affordable,

1356
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,159
and is willing to sacrifice
performance for that.

1357
01:01:57,159 --> 01:02:01,869
So the way you can think of
this is the shape of the utility

1358
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:05,819
curves for those decision
makers has now shifted,

1359
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,940
and because of that
the architecture

1360
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,619
or the choice of concept
that you would go for

1361
01:02:11,619 --> 01:02:13,384
may be different.

1362
01:02:13,385 --> 01:02:15,510
AUDIENCE: This happens to
NASA all the time, right?

1363
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,218
PROFESSOR: Right.

1364
01:02:16,217 --> 01:02:18,429
And so this is not
just a DOD issue.

1365
01:02:18,429 --> 01:02:19,690
And in commercial world.

1366
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:24,280
You know, a new CEO comes
in, new CTO comes in,

1367
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,580
and these utility
curves actually shift.

1368
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,440
So you've got to be
to be aware of this.

1369
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,470
So one of the big
topics there is--

1370
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:35,230
particularly now with NASA is--

1371
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:38,920
how do you choose an
architecture, a concept,

1372
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:44,260
that is robust to changing
utilities and decision makers.

1373
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,600
So maybe you don't go
for the super duper

1374
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:49,539
best, most exciting,
most capable

1375
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:51,849
concept, but you go
for the one that's

1376
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:56,019
least likely to be
overturned or disrupted

1377
01:02:56,019 --> 01:02:58,820
with the next administration.

1378
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:01,940
And this is a discussion--
active discussion--

1379
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,650
right now at NASA headquarters.

1380
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,450
You know, what are
the investments

1381
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:08,359
you can make that are
going to provide utility,

1382
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,110
even if the utility function
of the future decision makers

1383
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:13,440
changes?

1384
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,110
It's a big, big topic.

1385
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,260
The other thing
is, of course, this

1386
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:20,820
requires your formulation
of preferences.

1387
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,720
Those K factors,
those weightings,

1388
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:26,000
a priori-- before
you've actually

1389
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,409
scored the alternatives.

1390
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:28,909
All right.

1391
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:31,009
So the example I want
to talk you through

1392
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,700
is essentially a space tug.

1393
01:03:34,699 --> 01:03:37,519
So we're going to do
trade space exploration.

1394
01:03:37,519 --> 01:03:40,759
There's a trade space, a
design space, of alternatives--

1395
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,620
conceptual alternatives.

1396
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:44,599
And we're going to
try to understand

1397
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,219
that using utility theory.

1398
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:50,779
And let me explain to you
what we mean by space tug.

1399
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:54,230
So a space tug is essentially a
satellite that has the ability

1400
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:58,400
to change its orbital elements--
there are six orbital elements,

1401
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,639
semi-major axis,
eccentricity, inclination,

1402
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:05,829
right ascension of the
ascending node, and so forth--

1403
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:08,719
of a target satellite
by a predefined amount

1404
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,329
without degrading its
functionality in the process.

1405
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:14,329
So here's a picture
of the earth.

1406
01:04:14,329 --> 01:04:15,799
There's two orbits.

1407
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:19,190
The space tug is here
in the black orbit,

1408
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,530
and then our target satellite
is in the orange orbit.

1409
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,000
And so the typical
process is the space tug

1410
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,849
waits in its parking
orbit-- the black orbit.

1411
01:04:28,849 --> 01:04:30,170
It gets tasked.

1412
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:33,619
It transfers to the other
orbit, searches for the target,

1413
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:37,519
identifies it rendezvous and
approach, docking and capture,

1414
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,090
does an orbital transfer
and then releases the target

1415
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:44,510
satellite at the new
orbit, verifies its status

1416
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,670
and then either goes
directly to the next target,

1417
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:49,039
or returns to the parking orbit.

1418
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,630
And as you can
imagine, depending

1419
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:52,610
on the plane changes
that are required here

1420
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,920
this can be quite expensive.

1421
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,920
It's less expensive in
geosynchronous orbit,

1422
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:02,900
and there are some
capabilities that we

1423
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,420
think heard about in
the public that US

1424
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:08,000
and maybe other countries
have as well to do this.

1425
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,239


1426
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:14,179
But there's also applications--
commercial applications for it.

1427
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:16,309
So, for example,
for space debris

1428
01:05:16,309 --> 01:05:18,239
removal and things like that.

1429
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,059
So that's what we
mean by space tug.

1430
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:23,219
So what are the attributes?

1431
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:28,019
What are the-- so this is
based on a paper from 2003

1432
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:31,800
called Understanding the Orbital
Transfer Vehicle Trade Space.

1433
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:37,530
And so here's three attributes
that are combined into utility:

1434
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:41,610
total delta V capability-- delta
V is the change in velocity.

1435
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:44,640
This essentially tells
you where can it go?

1436
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:47,099
You calculate that from
essentially the rocket

1437
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:48,239
equation.

1438
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,429
The second one is response time.

1439
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:53,849
How fast can it get there
after it has been tasked?

1440
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,849
And there there's a big
distinction between--

1441
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:58,360
it's almost binary--
between electric propulsion,

1442
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,190
which is very efficient
but slow, and then chemical

1443
01:06:02,190 --> 01:06:03,360
propulsion.

1444
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:07,349
The third is the mass of
the observation or grappling

1445
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:08,519
equipment.

1446
01:06:08,519 --> 01:06:12,009
And so this tells you what
it can do when it gets there.

1447
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,820
So the size of target
satellites that can be actually

1448
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:16,140
interacted with.

1449
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:20,279
Those are the three attributes
that define utility,

1450
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:25,110
and we combine those into a
utility between zero and one.

1451
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,380
And then in this case, cost
or a surrogate for cost

1452
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:30,059
is kept separately.

1453
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:32,250
This is the vehicle
wet and dry mass.

1454
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,840
These are the cost
drivers, and this

1455
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:37,950
is calculated from some
simple scaling relationships.

1456
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:39,719
And so what we're
interested in is

1457
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:42,389
looking at the trade
space of utility

1458
01:06:42,389 --> 01:06:45,989
versus cost of the system.

1459
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:50,719
So how is utility
defined for a space tug?

1460
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:58,059
So we have response time, which
is bad in electric systems.

1461
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:02,103
Total utility is a weighted sum,
and then we estimate the cost

1462
01:07:02,103 --> 01:07:03,019
from wet and dry mass.

1463
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,030
So the delta V
utility is shown here.

1464
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:07,890
This is in terms of
meters per second.

1465
01:07:07,889 --> 01:07:11,670
So two, four, six, eight,
10 kilometers per second.

1466
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:15,110
These are pretty large delta
Vs. And what's interesting

1467
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:20,210
is this is a larger is
better, but it's a step curve.

1468
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:22,699
It's not a smooth curve,
it's a step curve.

1469
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:23,809
Why is that?

1470
01:07:23,809 --> 01:07:27,199
Because as you reach
certain delta Vs,

1471
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:32,480
it enables operating just in
GEO or a LEO-GEO transfer,

1472
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,710
or a LEO-GEO return.

1473
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:35,210
Right?

1474
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,230
So you can use the space
tug more than once,

1475
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:39,559
the more delta V you have.

1476
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:43,849
And it's a step curve because as
you hit this value of delta V,

1477
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:48,360
you can now operate
in a different regime.

1478
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,890
The capability.

1479
01:07:49,889 --> 01:07:53,460
The payload mass
utility is essentially

1480
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,690
discretized between low,
medium, high, and extreme.

1481
01:07:57,690 --> 01:07:59,490
So low is for small satellites.

1482
01:07:59,489 --> 01:08:02,219
Medium satellites up
to one metric ton,

1483
01:08:02,219 --> 01:08:04,500
up to three metric tons,
and then more than five

1484
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,500
metric tons, which
are the big satellites

1485
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,389
in geosynchronous orbit.

1486
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:13,409
And then the weighting factors
are we're going to capability

1487
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:17,670
30%, delta V 60%, and
the time responsiveness

1488
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,130
of the system 10%.

1489
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:23,100
So time responsiveness is
not that important compared

1490
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,939
to the other two.

1491
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:26,609
So once we have this--

1492
01:08:26,609 --> 01:08:28,680
I'm not going to go
through all the details

1493
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,689
of the calculations.

1494
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:33,920
That's in that paper,
which I'll post.

1495
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:35,920
You get this.

1496
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,869
So this is a cloud of points.

1497
01:08:37,869 --> 01:08:40,890
Each point here represents
a particular alternative

1498
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:45,090
or architecture, and we have the
cost of the system in millions

1499
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:45,649
of dollars.

1500
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:46,980
So this is not cheap.

1501
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:47,478
All right?

1502
01:08:47,479 --> 01:08:50,590
This is a billion dollars,
two billion, three billion.

1503
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:54,359
And then we have this utility,
this dimensionless utility.

1504
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:56,640
And, of course, what we're
particularly interested in

1505
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,170
is this lower right corner:
high utility lower cost systems.

1506
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,989
And what we did here is to
identify some particularly

1507
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:08,670
interesting
architecture, as they're

1508
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:10,470
shown here in this space.

1509
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:13,289
So let me just
explain two of them.

1510
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:14,569
One of them, here--

1511
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:17,609
and we gave them names
that are recognizable.

1512
01:09:17,609 --> 01:09:21,060
So this point here,
it's below 0.4,

1513
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,840
so it's a rather
lower utility system,

1514
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,260
but it's also
relatively affordable.

1515
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:31,920
We call it the bi-prop
low-earth orbit tender.

1516
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,859
So it's intended for
use in low-earth orbit

1517
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:38,609
and it has a dry mass
of about 680 kilograms,

1518
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:40,410
a wet mass of 1,400.

1519
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,239
So the difference
is propellant--

1520
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:44,938
about 800 kilograms
of propellant--

1521
01:09:44,939 --> 01:09:47,800
and has reasonable
size and mass fraction.

1522
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,369
And it's fairly responsive.

1523
01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:55,199
Another alternative is what we
call the electric geocruiser.

1524
01:09:55,199 --> 01:09:56,859
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

1525
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:59,670
This is basically a space
tug that operates only

1526
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:01,680
in geosynchronous orbit.

1527
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:04,200
So you launch into
geosynchronous orbit,

1528
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:07,800
but once it's there
it can do a lot.

1529
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,409
But it's electric,
so it's kind of slow.

1530
01:10:10,409 --> 01:10:12,670
Seven hundred eleven
kilograms dry mass,

1531
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,529
1,100 kilograms wet mass.

1532
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:20,460
And it includes return of
the tug to a safe orbit.

1533
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,409
And this is sort of a versatile
space tug in the GEO belt.

1534
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:28,050
So that's the idea.

1535
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,140
You calculate utility,
shown on the x-axis,

1536
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,750
you have the cost of the system.

1537
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:35,100
You have this cloud of points.

1538
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,930
And you start
understanding what are

1539
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:41,760
the interesting architectures
in that trade space.

1540
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,480
This is the same trade space.

1541
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:45,509
But now what we've
done here is we've

1542
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:49,989
shown the choice of
propulsion system is critical.

1543
01:10:49,989 --> 01:10:53,619
And what you can see here,
it's really almost impossible

1544
01:10:53,619 --> 01:10:55,420
to get to a utility of one.

1545
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,730
It's very, very hard.

1546
01:10:57,729 --> 01:11:02,549
And the reason for this
is the rocket equation.

1547
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,539
You see how these--

1548
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:08,279
so the blue are the
bi-propellant architectures.

1549
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:10,710
The purple are the
cryogenic, so these are

1550
01:11:10,710 --> 01:11:13,260
[? lux ?] hydrogen propulsion.

1551
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,539
The yellow ones are the
electric propulsion system,

1552
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:17,609
and then we also have
nuclear propulsion, here,

1553
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:21,449
which clearly is challenging
and has policy implications.

1554
01:11:21,449 --> 01:11:23,550
So you can see the
nuclear propulsion gets

1555
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:26,100
you close to much
higher utility,

1556
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:28,170
but it's also much,
much more expensive.

1557
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,300
But in all cases,
as you're trying

1558
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,460
to get more and more
utility, at some point

1559
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:35,470
you hit the wall because
of the rocket equation,

1560
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:37,039
which is very non-linear.

1561
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:38,729
You know, more fuel--

1562
01:11:38,729 --> 01:11:40,409
in order to carry
more fuel, you need

1563
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:42,840
more dry mass, more
fuel and dry mass

1564
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:47,640
requires more fuel to push,
and the system blows up on you.

1565
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:49,750
And you can see this
in these curves.

1566
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:52,109
So you get some
physical intuition

1567
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:53,699
in terms of the
shape of the space.

1568
01:11:53,699 --> 01:11:54,340
Yeah?

1569
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:57,574
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason
between this layering of cost?

1570
01:11:57,573 --> 01:11:58,239
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1571
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:02,789
They're essentially, if
I remember correctly,

1572
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:05,680
the capability of the system.

1573
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,159
Remember there's this
small, medium, large,

1574
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:11,010
you know the size of
the grappling equipment?

1575
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:12,690
I think that's the
tiering that you see.

1576
01:12:12,689 --> 01:12:16,293
AUDIENCE: That doesn't
change the utility?

1577
01:12:16,293 --> 01:12:18,460
PROFESSOR: Well, it depends
on the weighting, right?

1578
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:21,310
So as you change the weighting
among the attributes,

1579
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:22,810
that space can get scrambled.

1580
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:28,270
This space is valid for
that particular weighting.

1581
01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:30,250
So any questions about--

1582
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:34,210
this is utility theory,
multi-attribute utility theory,

1583
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:38,279
applied to trade
space exploration.

1584
01:12:38,279 --> 01:12:40,479
Any questions?

1585
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:40,979
Go ahead.

1586
01:12:40,979 --> 01:12:44,529


1587
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:45,774
EPFL, do you have a question?

1588
01:12:45,774 --> 01:12:51,829


1589
01:12:51,829 --> 01:12:53,050
OK.

1590
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:57,159
So now what you see
here is implicitly,

1591
01:12:57,159 --> 01:12:59,949
is there's nothing here
in the lower right corner.

1592
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:03,699
There is no system that
has perfect utility

1593
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:05,139
and is low cost.

1594
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:06,000
Right?

1595
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
There's an empty space.

1596
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,880
We'd love to be here, but
there's nothing there.

1597
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:12,614
So the best we can do
is get close to that.

1598
01:13:12,614 --> 01:13:14,739
And that's what I want to
talk about next, which is

1599
01:13:14,739 --> 01:13:16,929
this concept of non-dominance.

1600
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,579
So what do we mean
by non-dominance?

1601
01:13:18,579 --> 01:13:21,760
What is a Pareto
frontier and what is

1602
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,890
multi-objective optimization?

1603
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:27,220
The key point about
this is that when

1604
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:30,520
you do non-dominance
filtering, when

1605
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:32,800
you look for Pareto
frontiers, you

1606
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,880
do not need to express your
preferences ahead of time.

1607
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:37,609
Right?

1608
01:13:37,609 --> 01:13:41,599
So when you do you a
weighted Pugh matrix or when

1609
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,190
you do a utility theory, you
had to define ahead of time,

1610
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:49,639
before you did the scoring,
what's more important--

1611
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:53,539
fuel efficiency is twice
as important to me as cost.

1612
01:13:53,539 --> 01:13:54,039
Right?

1613
01:13:54,039 --> 01:13:55,760
The weighting, the
preferences had

1614
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,079
to be expressed a priori--
before you did the scoring.

1615
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,890
And there's arguments that
that's not the best thing

1616
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,950
to do, but you can do it.

1617
01:14:06,949 --> 01:14:12,500
Here in non-dominance and
multi-objective optimization,

1618
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,199
eventually you have to
express your preferences,

1619
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:18,529
but you do it after
you've scored the options.

1620
01:14:18,529 --> 01:14:21,349
That's a really
important distinction.

1621
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:25,000
So let me give you a little
history here on this.

1622
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,460
And what's really interesting is
there's a Lausanne connection.

1623
01:14:28,460 --> 01:14:29,181
OK?

1624
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:30,639
There's a connection
with Lausanne.

1625
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,780
So the word Pareto
frontier is named

1626
01:14:34,779 --> 01:14:38,889
after a an economist,
who actually

1627
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,039
started as an engineer,
Vilfredo Pareto.

1628
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:47,229
He was born in Paris in
1848 and then graduated

1629
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:50,769
from the University
of Turin in 1870.

1630
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:54,220
Very much in engineering,
civil engineering,

1631
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,949
his thesis title was The
Fundamental Principles

1632
01:14:56,949 --> 01:14:59,199
of Equilibrium and Solid Bodies.

1633
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:01,779
Something we take--
that's pretty basic now.

1634
01:15:01,779 --> 01:15:06,369
Forces and torques in
equilibrium on a body.

1635
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:11,079
Now he worked as a civil
engineer in Florence,

1636
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:14,289
and then he got interested
in philosophy, politics,

1637
01:15:14,289 --> 01:15:17,590
and economics, and he started
to think about this in terms

1638
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:22,850
of how does this concept of
equilibrium apply to economics?

1639
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:25,840
And in 1893, he actually
became a professor

1640
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:27,489
at the University
of Lausanne, which

1641
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:31,300
is located right next
to EPFL, and started

1642
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:37,869
applying this to economics
and societal theory.

1643
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:43,210
And then he did-- some of his
work was a bit controversial,

1644
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,609
but the one that I
want to talk about here

1645
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,069
is this the idea of
the Pareto optimum.

1646
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:51,460
And I will-- let me just
read this quote to you.

1647
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:54,880
"The optimum allocation of
the resources of a society

1648
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,460
is not attained,
so long as it is

1649
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:00,850
possible to make at least
one individual better off

1650
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:05,320
in his or her own estimation,
while keeping others

1651
01:16:05,319 --> 01:16:09,619
as well off as before in
their own estimation."

1652
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:13,809
So what it means is if
you can make an investment

1653
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:19,780
or make a change in society that
makes a particular individual

1654
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:24,159
or group of individuals better
off in their own estimation,

1655
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,630
without having to take the
resources from another group

1656
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,859
and make them less
well-off, then you've

1657
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:35,128
not reached an optimal
allocation of resources.

1658
01:16:35,128 --> 01:16:36,670
You know, if there
can be a win-win--

1659
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:40,079
if everybody can be better off
by making certain investments,

1660
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:43,559
you haven't yet found
the optimal strategy.

1661
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,610
Only when-- the only way
to make somebody better off

1662
01:16:47,609 --> 01:16:50,670
in their own estimation than
somebody else is by taking--

1663
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:53,730
and this is a big political
debate still today--

1664
01:16:53,729 --> 01:16:57,029
by taking from one group
and redistributing resources

1665
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,229
to the other.

1666
01:16:58,229 --> 01:17:00,399
When you're in that
situation, then you

1667
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:03,579
are at the Pareto optimal point.

1668
01:17:03,579 --> 01:17:04,470
OK?

1669
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:08,610
So that's the key
idea underlying this.

1670
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:16,139
So what this means
mathematically is that

1671
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,610
an optimal solution --

1672
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:21,539
X*-- is optimal if and only if--

1673
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:24,130


1674
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:27,100
for a feasible solution--
so, first of all the solution

1675
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:28,970
has to be feasible.

1676
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,770
And this is when you
have multiple criteria.

1677
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:34,900
We're trying to do
vector optimization,

1678
01:17:34,899 --> 01:17:37,659
and x must be what we call
an efficient solution,

1679
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:40,630
and it's efficient only
if its objective vector--

1680
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:44,020
J of X-- is non- dominated.

1681
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:48,430
And what this means is that
if you're looking at a point,

1682
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:51,760
it's only efficient
when it is not

1683
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,390
possible to move from that
point to another point

1684
01:17:55,390 --> 01:18:00,740
without degrading at least
one of the other objectives.

1685
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:03,579
So if you can move from
a particular design point

1686
01:18:03,579 --> 01:18:08,029
to another design point, and
all the objectives get better,

1687
01:18:08,029 --> 01:18:09,759
you're not yet efficient.

1688
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,460
You're not yet at a
Pareto optimal point.

1689
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:16,949
And this gets us to the
notion of dominance.

1690
01:18:16,949 --> 01:18:21,970
So dominance-- let's say we have
two designs, two alternatives--

1691
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:23,949
J1 and J2.

1692
01:18:23,949 --> 01:18:26,109
Those are their
objective vectors.

1693
01:18:26,109 --> 01:18:28,750
It means that-- this
is for maximization.

1694
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,640
We're trying to maximize.

1695
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:35,380
It means J1 dominates
J2 weakly if J1

1696
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:43,710
is better or equal J2, and at
least in one of the objectives,

1697
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,840
I, strictly better than J2.

1698
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,529
So you could have
two alternatives.

1699
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:51,829
This gets back to Pugh
matrix and the question--

1700
01:18:51,829 --> 01:18:55,090
who asked about the ties?

1701
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:57,462
You did, right?

1702
01:18:57,462 --> 01:18:58,800
It's so long ago.

1703
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:01,770
It's like, wait a minute, it's
like an hour ago, you know?

1704
01:19:01,770 --> 01:19:05,430
So we have two alternatives, OK?

1705
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:07,300
They're all equal.

1706
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:09,900
They're tied in all
criteria, except for one,

1707
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:12,689
where J1 is better than J2.

1708
01:19:12,689 --> 01:19:16,739
Which means that J1 will
dominate J2, but weakly,

1709
01:19:16,739 --> 01:19:17,969
because there's some ties.

1710
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:18,960
Right?

1711
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,609
And then there's a
stronger definition,

1712
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:26,519
which is that J1 strongly
dominates dominates J2 if

1713
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:29,340
and only if it is
better strictly

1714
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:32,289
better in all attributes.

1715
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:35,579
So for J1 to
dominate J2 strongly,

1716
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:39,859
it's got to be better in
all attributes than J2.

1717
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:42,460
Does that make sense?

1718
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:42,960
OK.

1719
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,020
So I know this is
a bit abstract.

1720
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:48,390
So let's do a concept
question that's

1721
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:52,590
sort of based on a
hypothetical but real example.

1722
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:57,110
So assume-- let's
say you're in charge

1723
01:19:57,109 --> 01:20:00,469
of designing in new
commercial aircraft,

1724
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:03,699
and there's four criteria.

1725
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:06,039
You want to maximize range.

1726
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:07,869
You want to minimize the costs--

1727
01:20:07,869 --> 01:20:10,449
dollars per kilometer flown.

1728
01:20:10,449 --> 01:20:13,389
You want to maximize the
capacity of the airplane--

1729
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:14,950
number of passengers.

1730
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:19,239
And you want to maximize cruise
speed in kilometers per hour.

1731
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:22,729
So it's a multi-objective
aircraft design.

1732
01:20:22,729 --> 01:20:23,919
You do all the work.

1733
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,480
You do concept generation.

1734
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:28,119
You come up with eight
concepts for airplanes,

1735
01:20:28,119 --> 01:20:29,800
and you evaluate them.

1736
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:32,619
And they're shown here--
one, two, three, et cetera,

1737
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:33,880
through eight.

1738
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,380
So let's just look
at number one.

1739
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:36,850
What does this mean?

1740
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:39,370
Airplane number one,
concept number one,

1741
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:43,569
has a range of 7,587 kilometers.

1742
01:20:43,569 --> 01:20:47,659
It has a operating cost
of $321 per kilometer.

1743
01:20:47,659 --> 01:20:50,439
It can carry 112 passengers.

1744
01:20:50,439 --> 01:20:52,809
And it has a cruise
speed or max speed

1745
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:55,910
of 950 kilometers per hour.

1746
01:20:55,909 --> 01:20:57,880
So I'm going to leave this up.

1747
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,119
This is like a five
minute-- this is--

1748
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,122
on the next slide,
I'm going to ask you--

1749
01:21:04,122 --> 01:21:06,130
and we'll come back to this--

1750
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:10,829
which of these airplane designs,
these eight, are non-dominated.

1751
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:14,970
Meaning that they're not
dominated by any of the other.

1752
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,770
And we're going to apply
weak dominance here.

1753
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,520
That was going to be
your question, right?

1754
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,510
Weak dominance.

1755
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,186
So I don't think it
actually matters.

1756
01:21:22,186 --> 01:21:24,019
I don't think there's
too many ties in here,

1757
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:27,260
but apply weak dominance.

1758
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:30,199
So which of these
are non-dominated?

1759
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:35,550
Meaning that you wouldn't
discard them right off the bat,

1760
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,329
because there are some strong
features that they have.

1761
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:43,529
So work through this.

1762
01:21:43,529 --> 01:21:49,349
You might want to write down
which ones are non-dominated.

1763
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,510
And then we'll do
the concert question,

1764
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,640
and then we'll show
you the answer.

1765
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:55,110
AUDIENCE: I just
want to make sure.

1766
01:21:55,109 --> 01:21:58,439
So non-dominated as
in there is not one

1767
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:01,613
that could be considered
better than it?

1768
01:22:01,613 --> 01:22:02,279
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1769
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:07,159
So, this is the definition.

1770
01:22:07,159 --> 01:22:09,939


1771
01:22:09,939 --> 01:22:10,479
All right.

1772
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:16,059
So let me-- so please
submit your answers.

1773
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,220
So here are the choices.

1774
01:22:18,220 --> 01:22:20,440
Which airplane designs
are non-dominated?

1775
01:22:20,439 --> 01:22:22,449
Five, six, and seven.

1776
01:22:22,449 --> 01:22:24,399
One, three, four, and eight.

1777
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:25,929
One, two, three,
four, and eight.

1778
01:22:25,930 --> 01:22:27,090
Two, three, five, and six.

1779
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:28,300
One, three, four, and seven.

1780
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:32,140
Or you need-- this
is not answerable.

1781
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,270
You need more information
to answer the question.

1782
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:37,470
OK?

1783
01:22:37,470 --> 01:22:44,800
So we have a pretty
good distribution here.

1784
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:49,710
So the wisdom of crowds
I think prevails.

1785
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,069
So the correct answer is the
third one-- one, two, three,

1786
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:54,479
four, and eight.

1787
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:58,529
So 36% of you got it right.

1788
01:22:58,529 --> 01:23:02,009
Now let me let me show
you the solution to this.

1789
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:04,350
So it is, in fact,
possible to answer this

1790
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:07,090
without additional information.

1791
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:09,750
So the way to do
this is you have

1792
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:12,430
to do pairwise comparisons.

1793
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:14,270
Now you said about--

1794
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:15,760
I think your strategy--

1795
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,380
What did you say, early on?

1796
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,020
AUDIENCE: I was
looking at maximums.

1797
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,686
PROFESSOR: You were
looking at maximums.

1798
01:23:20,685 --> 01:23:22,710
So you were saying
who's the best

1799
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:26,670
performer among the
concepts for each criteria?

1800
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:30,789
And you found those pretty
easily, I would assume, right?

1801
01:23:30,789 --> 01:23:31,289
So what--

1802
01:23:31,289 --> 01:23:33,619
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1803
01:23:33,619 --> 01:23:34,229
PROFESSOR: OK.

1804
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:35,819
So you've got to
get the sign right.

1805
01:23:35,819 --> 01:23:38,229
Do you have the
mic on, by the way.

1806
01:23:38,229 --> 01:23:41,189
So what would--
if that concept is

1807
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:43,259
the best performer
in a criterion,

1808
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,100
what does that tell you?

1809
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,520
AUDIENCE: It means that
none of the other performers

1810
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:49,320
have something
equal to or greater

1811
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,369
than that performer
for that criterion.

1812
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:57,019
PROFESSOR: And this relates to
the question-- is it Martin?

1813
01:23:57,020 --> 01:23:57,690
Martin?

1814
01:23:57,689 --> 01:23:59,149
In the red shirt, first row?

1815
01:23:59,149 --> 01:24:01,881


1816
01:24:01,881 --> 01:24:03,089
I didn't get your name right.

1817
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:04,692
I'm sorry.

1818
01:24:04,692 --> 01:24:05,442
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

1819
01:24:05,442 --> 01:24:06,470
PROFESSOR: Bastian.

1820
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:07,409
Bastian.

1821
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:08,609
Bastian.

1822
01:24:08,609 --> 01:24:10,409
You remember at the
start of the lecture,

1823
01:24:10,409 --> 01:24:12,742
you said-- what did you say
at the start of the lecture?

1824
01:24:12,743 --> 01:24:16,160


1825
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:20,474
AUDIENCE: I said that if you
evaluate all the concepts based

1826
01:24:20,474 --> 01:24:22,505
on just plus or minus
for the criteria,

1827
01:24:22,505 --> 01:24:28,369
you might have one where
you evaluate all the--

1828
01:24:28,369 --> 01:24:30,577
a bunch of criteria
that are negatives,

1829
01:24:30,577 --> 01:24:32,159
but there's just one
that is positive.

1830
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:34,391
But that one might be
very, very positive.

1831
01:24:34,391 --> 01:24:35,099
PROFESSOR: Right.

1832
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:37,230
So that's exactly
the point here.

1833
01:24:37,229 --> 01:24:38,909
That's exactly this point.

1834
01:24:38,909 --> 01:24:42,750
If you are-- if this concept
is the best performer

1835
01:24:42,750 --> 01:24:44,869
in just one of the criteria.

1836
01:24:44,869 --> 01:24:48,119
Like it has the best
speed, or the lowest cost,

1837
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:51,989
but it's terrible, terrible
in everything else,

1838
01:24:51,989 --> 01:24:52,889
it doesn't matter.

1839
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:56,610
In terms of dominance,
it is non-dominated.

1840
01:24:56,609 --> 01:24:59,920
It cannot be dominated
by any other concept.

1841
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,569
If you are the best in class,
even just for one criteria--

1842
01:25:03,569 --> 01:25:05,460
does that make sense?

1843
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:11,000
You cannot be dominated by any
other design if you're the best

1844
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,878
performer on just one criterion.

1845
01:25:14,878 --> 01:25:16,420
So let's think about
track and field.

1846
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:19,090


1847
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:21,789
So the people-- who's
doing track and field?

1848
01:25:21,789 --> 01:25:23,019
Any athletes here?

1849
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:25,780
Like runners or javelin or--

1850
01:25:25,779 --> 01:25:26,300
Veronica.

1851
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,320
I didn't know that about you.

1852
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:30,509
Cross country and track.

1853
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:31,320
OK.

1854
01:25:31,319 --> 01:25:32,269
So 5K?

1855
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:35,130


1856
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:35,869
All right.

1857
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,809
So let's say--

1858
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:40,820
I'm sure you were
very good at 5K.

1859
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:42,751
And how was your shot putt?

1860
01:25:42,752 --> 01:25:45,690
AUDIENCE: I never
competed in the shot putt.

1861
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:46,629
PROFESSOR: OK.

1862
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:49,239
So then we don't know, right?

1863
01:25:49,239 --> 01:25:53,109
But the point I'm trying to make
is you could be a super duper

1864
01:25:53,109 --> 01:25:56,839
specialist in one criterion,
and that's-- you can will win

1865
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:59,010
a gold medal with that.

1866
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:02,320
But you're very maybe
not good in other things.

1867
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:04,170
So that's the point
here is in order

1868
01:26:04,170 --> 01:26:07,649
to be dominated, if you're
the best performer--

1869
01:26:07,649 --> 01:26:10,769
so, right off the
bat, in this exercise

1870
01:26:10,770 --> 01:26:12,930
here, in our little
exercise, you

1871
01:26:12,930 --> 01:26:17,310
can remove all the concepts that
are best in class from the set.

1872
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:19,870
Because they cannot
be dominated.

1873
01:26:19,869 --> 01:26:22,319
So they have to
be non-dominated.

1874
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:25,079
OK, so the way
you do the scoring

1875
01:26:25,079 --> 01:26:29,250
with pairwise comparisons is you
say, let's compare one and two.

1876
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,199
Concept one and two.

1877
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:36,059
Well, one is better
in range, right?

1878
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,640
And it's better in speed.

1879
01:26:38,640 --> 01:26:42,240
But then the second concept
is better in two and three.

1880
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:45,329
So the score here
is two versus two,

1881
01:26:45,329 --> 01:26:50,220
which means neither one nor
two dominate each other, right?

1882
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:53,340
Even if it's-- what
if it's three to one?

1883
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:57,000
What if it was a
three to one score?

1884
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,739
It would still be true, right?

1885
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:01,439
That one doesn't--
one is, in a sense,

1886
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:03,599
better because it's
better than the other.

1887
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,840
But it doesn't dominate
it, because dominance

1888
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,110
is a very crisp definition.

1889
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:12,750
Now this is different, right?

1890
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,670
Compare one versus number six.

1891
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,310
Concept one versus concept six.

1892
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,180
One is better in all
four criteria to six.

1893
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:25,020
So clearly, solution one
dominates solution six,

1894
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:27,330
and as a rational
decision maker,

1895
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:30,840
you can eliminate
concept six from the set

1896
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,550
because it is completely
dominated by concept one.

1897
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:35,430
OK?

1898
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:37,350
So in order to be
dominated, a solution

1899
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:42,970
must have essentially a score of
zero in a pairwise comparison.

1900
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:45,930
Now, if we apply this
to the full set of eight

1901
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,940
we can actually show
this as a matrix.

1902
01:27:47,939 --> 01:27:50,759
I call that the
domination matrix.

1903
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,920
It shows which
solutions dominate

1904
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:55,289
which other solution--
the horizontal rows

1905
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:56,909
and the vertical rows.

1906
01:27:56,909 --> 01:28:00,239
So the way you read this is
so where you see these dots,

1907
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,979
these are dominance
relationships

1908
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:03,939
in the pairwise comparison.

1909
01:28:03,939 --> 01:28:11,139
So this tells you that solution
two dominates solution five.

1910
01:28:11,140 --> 01:28:13,630
This tells us, if
we look column-wise,

1911
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:17,350
solution seven is dominated
by solution two and solution

1912
01:28:17,350 --> 01:28:18,550
eight.

1913
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:23,000
So, if we do the row sum-- if
we sum this along the rows,

1914
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,840
the row indicates
how many solutions

1915
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,110
this particular
solution dominates.

1916
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:31,539
And-- but the question
was about non-dominance,

1917
01:28:31,539 --> 01:28:33,279
so we need to look
at the column sum.

1918
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:35,800
The column sum
indicates by how many

1919
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,390
other solutions the kth solution
or concept is dominated.

1920
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:42,760
And when you do
this column sum, you

1921
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:47,739
can see that concepts one, two,
three, and four have a zero.

1922
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:50,210
They're not dominated
by any other design.

1923
01:28:50,210 --> 01:28:54,460
Column eight has a zero, and
concepts five, six, and seven

1924
01:28:54,460 --> 01:28:58,359
are dominated each by at
least one other concept, which

1925
01:28:58,359 --> 01:29:03,339
means that they're
dominated, and the others

1926
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:05,480
are non dominated.

1927
01:29:05,479 --> 01:29:07,989
So when you do your
concept selection,

1928
01:29:07,989 --> 01:29:10,829
you can actually apply
this to a much bigger set.

1929
01:29:10,829 --> 01:29:13,630
Your filter out all the
dominated solutions.

1930
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:17,560
And it turns out the bigger
your number of alternatives

1931
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:21,340
or architectures, the smaller
percentage-wise the set

1932
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:23,920
will be of
non-dominated solutions.

1933
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,270
And those are the ones you
really want to focus on.

1934
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:29,190
Is that clear?

1935
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:32,519
I know this takes a
little thinking about,

1936
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:33,780
what does this really mean?

1937
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:38,300
But but that's a very
rigorous way to do it.

1938
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:41,010
And then this gets
us to, eventually,

1939
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,430
this gets us to the notion
of Pareto optimality.

1940
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:46,460
So what's the relationship
between Pareto

1941
01:29:46,460 --> 01:29:48,680
optimality and non-dominance.

1942
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:51,470
So let's say we have
two objectives, J1--

1943
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:53,150
we want to maximize J1.

1944
01:29:53,149 --> 01:29:57,019
Maybe that's
performance, endurance.

1945
01:29:57,020 --> 01:29:58,550
We want to minimize J2--

1946
01:29:58,550 --> 01:30:00,409
maybe cost, for example.

1947
01:30:00,409 --> 01:30:05,010
So the Utopian point, or
the optimal corner to be in,

1948
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:06,289
is the lower right.

1949
01:30:06,289 --> 01:30:09,195
We want to maximize
J1, minimize J2.

1950
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:10,069
There's nothing here.

1951
01:30:10,069 --> 01:30:10,739
It's empty.

1952
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,439
There's nothing feasible here.

1953
01:30:12,439 --> 01:30:15,289
So the best we can do
is get close to it.

1954
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:17,630
So when you look at a
set of discrete points,

1955
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:21,170
discrete concepts,
those concepts

1956
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:23,480
can have three properties.

1957
01:30:23,479 --> 01:30:26,659
They can be D,
meaning dominated.

1958
01:30:26,659 --> 01:30:31,340
So all the red points
shown here are dominated.

1959
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:34,400
And the way you can see
this if you draw a little--

1960
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:40,129
let me try to let me
try to draw a box here.

1961
01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:44,970


1962
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:46,422
Where's the eraser?

1963
01:30:46,421 --> 01:30:54,179


1964
01:30:54,180 --> 01:30:56,765
So let's pick a point,
a particular point--

1965
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:59,800


1966
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:01,779
Let's pick this
point right here.

1967
01:31:01,779 --> 01:31:04,420


1968
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:07,000
Why do we know that
this point is dominated,

1969
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,895
just looking at it graphically?

1970
01:31:09,895 --> 01:31:10,770
How do you know that?

1971
01:31:10,770 --> 01:31:13,420


1972
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:14,710
Go ahead.

1973
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,755
AUDIENCE: The point
is not at the front.

1974
01:31:16,755 --> 01:31:18,130
PROFESSOR: It's
not at the front,

1975
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:20,930
but the way the way
to find first of all,

1976
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:23,230
whether it's dominated,
which is relative

1977
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:26,949
to the other solutions, is we
can just draw a horizontal line

1978
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:29,720
here, and a vertical line here.

1979
01:31:29,720 --> 01:31:31,510
And so in a
multi-dimensional space,

1980
01:31:31,510 --> 01:31:34,480
you're essentially
drawing a hyper-cube.

1981
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:37,569
And down here is our utopia.

1982
01:31:37,569 --> 01:31:40,090
This is where we would love
to be, but we can't be.

1983
01:31:40,090 --> 01:31:41,930
It's not feasible.

1984
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:45,880
And you see in this box, between
the point and the utopia,

1985
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:47,900
there is this other guy here.

1986
01:31:47,899 --> 01:31:50,210
This point here.

1987
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:53,239
And because it's there,
it's closer to the utopia,

1988
01:31:53,239 --> 01:31:57,829
and it dominates this
point in both objectives.

1989
01:31:57,829 --> 01:32:00,510
Let's take this point here.

1990
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:01,699
Let's do the same thing.

1991
01:32:01,699 --> 01:32:04,670
Draw a vertical line
and a horizontal line.

1992
01:32:04,670 --> 01:32:06,560
And there's a whole
bunch of points,

1993
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:10,970
all these points right
here are all the box,

1994
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,680
closer to the Utopian point.

1995
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,470
So this point here is actually
dominated by one, two, three,

1996
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:19,610
four, five, six
seven other points.

1997
01:32:19,609 --> 01:32:22,250
So that's essentially dominated.

1998
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,847
Let me erase this again.

1999
01:32:23,847 --> 01:32:27,519


2000
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,540
Then we have these darker
red, purple points.

2001
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:34,769
Let me just circle
them real quick.

2002
01:32:34,770 --> 01:32:42,000
So we have this point here, this
point, this point, this point,

2003
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,130
this one, and this one.

2004
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,980
And those are what we
call non-dominated,

2005
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,229
like we just did the filtering,
meaning there there's

2006
01:32:49,229 --> 01:32:53,729
no other point in the set that's
better than it in all criteria.

2007
01:32:53,729 --> 01:32:57,509
So you would consider them
as concepts to choose from.

2008
01:32:57,510 --> 01:33:03,159
But they're not exactly
on that dashed line,

2009
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:05,670
which means that there
is a way to improve them.

2010
01:33:05,670 --> 01:33:08,850
There's a way to tweak them,
to optimize them further,

2011
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:13,560
if you could to get them
right onto that dashed line.

2012
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:17,640
They're close but they're not
exactly on that dashed line.

2013
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:19,800
So you could tweak these
concepts to get them

2014
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,810
closer to the Pareto front.

2015
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:27,110
But they're still pretty good,
because they're non-dominated.

2016
01:33:27,109 --> 01:33:31,369
And then we have those grey
points, which are shown here.

2017
01:33:31,369 --> 01:33:33,319
There's three of them.

2018
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:36,061
Let me use a different
color for these.

2019
01:33:36,061 --> 01:33:42,229


2020
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:44,014
Let me use a different
color, maybe green.

2021
01:33:44,015 --> 01:33:49,140


2022
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:49,740
Here.

2023
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:55,889
This point, this point, and this
point, they are Pareto optimal.

2024
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:58,660
Meaning they're on
the Pareto front.

2025
01:33:58,659 --> 01:34:01,599
There's no way to
improve them, such

2026
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,310
that you could make
both objectives better.

2027
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:04,810
Right?

2028
01:34:04,810 --> 01:34:09,130
If you want to make J1 better,
you have to sacrifice on J2.

2029
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:12,279
So the only way to
modify these points

2030
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:15,639
is to slide along
the Pareto front,

2031
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,410
meaning you're trading
off the objectives.

2032
01:34:18,409 --> 01:34:19,849
Do you see that?

2033
01:34:19,850 --> 01:34:22,600
And so, in my spring
class that I teach,

2034
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,090
called Multi-disciplinary
System Optimization,

2035
01:34:25,090 --> 01:34:26,560
we get into this pretty deeply.

2036
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:30,190
Like how do you
actually do this?

2037
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:33,599
But the point I want
you to keep for now

2038
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:37,800
is that when you
select the concept,

2039
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,810
do not select a dominated one.

2040
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:42,390
Get rid of the dominated ones.

2041
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,690
Filter them out.

2042
01:34:43,689 --> 01:34:45,879
And then you still have to
choose among the others,

2043
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,340
and that's where your
preferences come in.

2044
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:51,970
Right, so given the blue
and green choices here,

2045
01:34:51,970 --> 01:34:54,520
which one are you going
to recommend at the end?

2046
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:59,440
And that this is sort of the
preferences between maximizing

2047
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:01,589
J1 and minimizing J2.

2048
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:04,239
That's a social
process of coming up

2049
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,679
with your preferences.

2050
01:35:05,680 --> 01:35:08,860
But you now determine
those preferences

2051
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:11,514
after you've scored
all the concepts.

2052
01:35:11,515 --> 01:35:13,420
Do you see the difference?

2053
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:16,720
That's pretty fundamental.

2054
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:17,579
OK.

2055
01:35:17,579 --> 01:35:23,189
So, one more thing and
then we'll wrap it up.

2056
01:35:23,189 --> 01:35:24,989
So now you've gone
through all this work.

2057
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:27,899
You've done your concept
generation, concept selections,

2058
01:35:27,899 --> 01:35:32,329
scoring, and you
found the one concept

2059
01:35:32,329 --> 01:35:35,760
that you're going
to go forward with.

2060
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,079
That's when you do PDR.

2061
01:35:37,079 --> 01:35:38,250
So what is the PDR?

2062
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:39,569
The Preliminary Design Review.

2063
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:43,529
You explain what concept and
system architecture was chosen.

2064
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:48,029
You explain why it
was chosen, and you

2065
01:35:48,029 --> 01:35:51,029
want this to be approved
as the design baseline

2066
01:35:51,029 --> 01:35:54,539
for going forward and doing
more detailed design work.

2067
01:35:54,539 --> 01:35:57,000
You compare it against
the rejected alternatives.

2068
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,720
Typically at the PDR, you will
spend some time on saying,

2069
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:03,420
these are the other
interesting concepts

2070
01:36:03,420 --> 01:36:05,760
that almost were
selected, but we didn't

2071
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,220
because of these reasons.

2072
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:13,869
You show some quantitative
analysis that gives confidence,

2073
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:17,640
especially you want to show that
the requirements that you had

2074
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:20,280
defined and agreed
upon at the SRR

2075
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:23,889
can be satisfied by
your chosen concept.

2076
01:36:23,890 --> 01:36:26,640
There's maybe still some
risk or some uncertainty.

2077
01:36:26,640 --> 01:36:29,660
So any risk reduction
experiments or prototypes.

2078
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:32,750
So you can actually do
prototyping at this stage.

2079
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,489
You don't want to
spend too much on that,

2080
01:36:34,489 --> 01:36:38,029
but you want to do enough of
it so you can reduce risks.

2081
01:36:38,029 --> 01:36:40,969
And then you do a preview
of the detailed design

2082
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:44,699
phase between PDR leading
up to CDR. So here--

2083
01:36:44,699 --> 01:36:47,869
I'm not going to read this--
but this is the description

2084
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:50,479
of what the PDR is all about.

2085
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:54,159
In the NASA system engineering
handbook on page 177,

2086
01:36:54,159 --> 01:36:55,970
there's a very
detailed description

2087
01:36:55,970 --> 01:37:00,780
of entrance criteria, exit
criteria, et cetera, et cetera.

2088
01:37:00,779 --> 01:37:05,981
So here's a description from
a PDR from a European program,

2089
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:07,939
and you can see it's a
pretty big group, right?

2090
01:37:07,939 --> 01:37:10,339
This is like 30, 40 people.

2091
01:37:10,340 --> 01:37:15,560
And because the PDR is
such an important decision,

2092
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:18,320
that's when you also invite
external stakeholders.

2093
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:21,559
And you want to make sure that
people come away from the PDR

2094
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,070
with confidence that,
yeah, we have a good system

2095
01:37:25,069 --> 01:37:25,920
architecture.

2096
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,649
We've picked the good
concept, and it's worthwhile

2097
01:37:28,649 --> 01:37:30,899
now putting all this
work into getting it

2098
01:37:30,899 --> 01:37:33,879
to a detailed design that
can actually be built.

2099
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:34,720
OK.

2100
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:39,590
Any questions about PDR, or
any experiences from PDRs

2101
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,510
that people want to share?

2102
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:44,003
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about the PDR.

2103
01:37:44,003 --> 01:37:45,920
So you said there's 30
people in that picture.

2104
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,380
How do you reconcile that with
seven plus, minus two rule?

2105
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:53,960
PROFESSOR: Well, it's seven,
plus or minus two, squared,

2106
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:54,739
right?

2107
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:59,989
So you have a
hierarchy of people.

2108
01:37:59,989 --> 01:38:03,043
Not everybody is a
decision maker here.

2109
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:03,710
AUDIENCE: I see.

2110
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,292
PROFESSOR: So you
probably have people

2111
01:38:05,292 --> 01:38:07,670
who did some of
the thermal design,

2112
01:38:07,670 --> 01:38:09,800
some people did
the cost modeling.

2113
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,310
So, it's a great
question actually.

2114
01:38:13,310 --> 01:38:16,340
You want many, many
voices and people

2115
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:19,069
who contributed to make
sure the PDR presents

2116
01:38:19,069 --> 01:38:21,649
all the information you have.

2117
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:24,619
You don't want to do a PDR
with just seven people.

2118
01:38:24,619 --> 01:38:27,229
AUDIENCE: But I guess you could
say that in the presentation,

2119
01:38:27,229 --> 01:38:30,589
I guess, only seven plus
or minus two, will people

2120
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,880
be driving at that
point in time.

2121
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,739
PROFESSOR: So there will
be a leadership, right?

2122
01:38:36,739 --> 01:38:40,340
There is an
organizational issue.

2123
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:46,670
But the point here is
that it's a big review.

2124
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:47,600
It's a big milestone.

2125
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:49,691
Please, go ahead.

2126
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:53,029
AUDIENCE: The big issue here is
that all the people who are not

2127
01:38:53,029 --> 01:38:55,649
decision makers, that
are in the picture, they

2128
01:38:55,649 --> 01:38:57,979
will have to implement
the detailed design,

2129
01:38:57,979 --> 01:39:01,250
so it's very important to
have them in the process.

2130
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:03,913
Otherwise, you have to go back
to your organization and do

2131
01:39:03,913 --> 01:39:07,185
the PDR again to explain
the what's and the why's.

2132
01:39:07,185 --> 01:39:10,023
This is why you try to have
these very large meetings.

2133
01:39:10,024 --> 01:39:13,771
When you do a pre-PDR,
you do a dry-run,

2134
01:39:13,771 --> 01:39:16,489
and you send stuff in
advance and make sure

2135
01:39:16,489 --> 01:39:19,273
that you're really
all agreeing finally,

2136
01:39:19,274 --> 01:39:25,453
if possible, you get the
discrepancies off the table.

2137
01:39:25,453 --> 01:39:27,661
But then you all agree that
this is how to go forward

2138
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:32,579
and then the worker
bees can go and do it.

2139
01:39:32,579 --> 01:39:35,449
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's another
reason for being inclusive.

2140
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:36,569
I agree with that.

2141
01:39:36,569 --> 01:39:41,479
Any other-- who has gone through
a PDR in their prior work?

2142
01:39:41,479 --> 01:39:42,609
Anybody want to share?

2143
01:39:42,609 --> 01:39:44,670
Marissa.

2144
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,060
Tell us about how that went.

2145
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:46,750
I mean as much--

2146
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:49,090
I know you can't probably
we share everything but--

2147
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,850
AUDIENCE: For us, I mean, it
was a pretty big milestone.

2148
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:53,766
You work a lot
leading up to a PDR

2149
01:39:53,765 --> 01:39:56,139
and then you finally have all
the really big stakeholders

2150
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:56,619
in the room.

2151
01:39:56,619 --> 01:39:58,300
And a lot of them have been
involved during the design

2152
01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,800
phase, but when you actually
have them all sitting there.

2153
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,270
And I think getting the
buy-in was also really--

2154
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:05,290
I think that's a
really big part of PDR.

2155
01:40:05,289 --> 01:40:06,250
Like normally you're
feeling pretty

2156
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:08,375
confident in your designs,
but then actually making

2157
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:11,529
sure whoever the agency is
that you're working with,

2158
01:40:11,529 --> 01:40:15,215
then your stakeholders are also
kind of all on the same page.

2159
01:40:15,215 --> 01:40:16,090
It's pretty critical.

2160
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,670
PROFESSOR: Did you discover
problems or discrepancies

2161
01:40:18,670 --> 01:40:19,569
during the PDR?

2162
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:20,194
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

2163
01:40:20,194 --> 01:40:23,829
I definitely think-- just
generally we've had delta PDRs,

2164
01:40:23,829 --> 01:40:25,899
if things weren't
completely thought through.

2165
01:40:25,899 --> 01:40:27,819
Or you'd have a fair
number of action items

2166
01:40:27,819 --> 01:40:30,840
that come out of PDR
to go and address

2167
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:33,770
before you really are allowed
to start moving towards CDR.

2168
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,670
PROFESSOR: Good.

2169
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:37,775
Any comments or experiences
with PDRs at EPFL?

2170
01:40:37,775 --> 01:40:45,078


2171
01:40:45,078 --> 01:40:46,869
AUDIENCE: I did a PDR
at the European Space

2172
01:40:46,869 --> 01:40:49,899
Agency during the
REXUS BEXUS program

2173
01:40:49,899 --> 01:40:52,239
three years ago, and
as far as I remember

2174
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:56,739
it was very appreciated to bring
as many details as possible.

2175
01:40:56,739 --> 01:41:00,519
And to be very close to
that critical design review

2176
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,710
stage in the PDR.

2177
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:06,590
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.

2178
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:09,289
So, that's good.

2179
01:41:09,289 --> 01:41:11,850
I think there's a good to
have detail and so forth.

2180
01:41:11,850 --> 01:41:13,400
But what's the downside?

2181
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:15,619
Can you think of a
negative what would

2182
01:41:15,619 --> 01:41:22,550
be what would be not so good
about almost being a CDR right

2183
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:23,420
there?

2184
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:25,730
Can you think about
a downside to it?

2185
01:41:25,729 --> 01:41:29,569


2186
01:41:29,569 --> 01:41:31,649
AUDIENCE: Probably not
taking too much time

2187
01:41:31,649 --> 01:41:34,679
in order to clarify the
concept and the requirement

2188
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:40,740
because you are in a rush
to finish the product.

2189
01:41:40,739 --> 01:41:42,710
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

2190
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:44,761
So it takes more time.

2191
01:41:44,761 --> 01:41:46,219
But what I'm thinking
about is it's

2192
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:49,930
very difficult to then undo
the decision or backtrack.

2193
01:41:49,930 --> 01:41:52,850
Let's say that at the
PDR that there's some--

2194
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:54,950
it could be that
you really forgot

2195
01:41:54,949 --> 01:41:56,420
something very important.

2196
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:00,619
And that your concept
is actually flawed.

2197
01:42:00,619 --> 01:42:04,159
But you didn't know it as you
were working inside your team.

2198
01:42:04,159 --> 01:42:07,819
And then if you have a design
that's almost CDR quality,

2199
01:42:07,819 --> 01:42:09,929
it's very difficult
to undo that.

2200
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:12,789
So I would say that a PDR--

2201
01:42:12,789 --> 01:42:18,019
I actually believe that at a
PDR you should have some detail,

2202
01:42:18,020 --> 01:42:20,700
but not too much yet.

2203
01:42:20,699 --> 01:42:25,460
I think a true PDR should be at
the system architectural level,

2204
01:42:25,460 --> 01:42:28,970
with some detail but
not all the details.

2205
01:42:28,970 --> 01:42:29,570
But thank you.

2206
01:42:29,569 --> 01:42:33,109
That's a great comment.

2207
01:42:33,109 --> 01:42:35,250
Thank you very much.

2208
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,560
So let me close it here.

2209
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:42,050
So in terms of concept selection
during conceptual design,

2210
01:42:42,050 --> 01:42:45,829
we can use Pugh
matrix selection.

2211
01:42:45,829 --> 01:42:49,130
And that's essentially
useful when we don't yet

2212
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,470
have those detailed
mathematical models.

2213
01:42:51,470 --> 01:42:53,030
It's qualitative.

2214
01:42:53,029 --> 01:42:56,779
And then as we move more
into preliminary design,

2215
01:42:56,779 --> 01:43:00,739
we use utility analysis,
especially for noncommercial

2216
01:43:00,739 --> 01:43:04,210
systems where a net present
value-- a financial--

2217
01:43:04,210 --> 01:43:06,500
in commercial companies,
you will often

2218
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:10,010
do a financial analysis
as a measure of utility.

2219
01:43:10,010 --> 01:43:12,289
And then this concept
of non-dominance

2220
01:43:12,289 --> 01:43:13,699
is very, very important.

2221
01:43:13,699 --> 01:43:16,550
Generating many designs
and then applying

2222
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:21,050
Pareto filters to try to come
down to the non-dominated set.

2223
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:23,940
So that's essentially
the essence of it.

2224
01:43:23,939 --> 01:43:27,389
So I hope that was clear.

2225
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:30,440
A-4 will be posted later today.

2226
01:43:30,439 --> 01:43:38,046
