10
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,169
OLIVER DE WECK: So let me start.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,080
Session 3 is about system
modeling languages.

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,949
But before I start, I'd like
to remind you that A1 is due

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,940
today.

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:41,909
The first assignment
is due today.

15
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:46,619
And I think neither [? Yuanna ?]
or I or [INAUDIBLE],,

16
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:48,849
did you get a lot of
questions about A1?

17
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,870


18
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:54,619
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

19
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,744
I didn't get any questions.

20
00:00:55,744 --> 00:00:56,618
OLIVER DE WECK: Yeah.

21
00:00:56,618 --> 00:00:58,250
So we didn't get many questions.

22
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,060
So I interpret
that as a positive,

23
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,150
but I guess we'll find out.

24
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,740
Everybody submitted.

25
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:12,219
Well, so we're hoping to have
these graded in about a week,

26
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,329
give you feedback.

27
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:16,899
And we'll also post
a master solution.

28
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,170
And A2 is out right now.

29
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,989
And the other good news is
there is no new assignment

30
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:24,429
today that's being--

31
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,700
the next A3 is going
to go out next week.

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,620


33
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,890
Any questions about A1?

34
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,500
Was there something
that was particularly

35
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,120
difficult or confusing?

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,710
Or was it straightforward?

37
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:40,149
Anybody want to comment on A1?

38
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,774


39
00:01:44,774 --> 00:01:47,629
Wow.

40
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,549
Sam.

41
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,081
Do you want me--
push the button.

42
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,539
GUEST SPEAKER: No,
our team thought

43
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,000
it was fairly clear
on what we had

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,808
to do based on the lectures.

45
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:58,599
OLIVER DE WECK: OK.

46
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,869
GUEST SPEAKER: We
didn't have any trouble.

47
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,189
OLIVER DE WECK: Good.

48
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,769
All right.

49
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:05,329
Well, let's keep going then.

50
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:08,900
So the V-Model is our
roadmap for the class.

51
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,759
We're starting to
fill in the V. We're

52
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,289
still in the upper left corner.

53
00:02:12,289 --> 00:02:15,319
And today's lecture is
actually a little different.

54
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,409
It's sort of in the center
of the V, system modeling

55
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,069
languages, as a
precondition or precursor

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,599
to what we've been calling MBSE,
Model-Based System Engineering.

57
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,489
So what I'd like to cover
today is why do we need--

58
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,960
or why have these system
modeling languages emerged,

59
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,320
particularly, what do we
mean by ontology, semantics,

60
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,729
and syntax?

61
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,549
And then we're going
to give you a--

62
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,219
I would characterize
this as a sampler

63
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:48,710
of three different
system modeling

64
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,689
languages that
have emerged really

65
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:53,909
within the last 10, 15 years.

66
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:58,370
The first one is called OPM,
Object Process Methodology.

67
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:02,270
The second one is called SySML,
System Modeling Language.

68
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,510
And then the third one
is called Modelica.

69
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:09,079
And then we'll sort of quickly
wrap up with the question,

70
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,090
you know, what does this mean
now for system engineering

71
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,460
today, and tomorrow
in the future?

72
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,000
So I'd like to motivate
this with a little exercise.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,120
So you remember Mr.
Sticky from last time?

74
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,700
You came up with
some requirements.

75
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,429
So it's kind of the simplest
system I could think of here.

76
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,140
So what we'd like to do is
have you work in pairs again.

77
00:03:32,139 --> 00:03:38,689
And the assignment here
is to describe this system

78
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:42,729
as clearly as you can,
provide a description.

79
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,389
So last time the assignment
was right, a requirement,

80
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:50,439
come up with some requirements
that led to this design.

81
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,930
But today I would
like you to describe

82
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,879
what the system is,
how it functions,

83
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,969
and so forth, as
clearly as you can.

84
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,719
And I would like
you to do this--

85
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,449
so hopefully you're on the
Webex, logged into the Webex.

86
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:07,000
I would like you to do
this in teams of two.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,099
And as you're
doing this, I don't

88
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,680
know if you've noticed but
on the Webex there's actually

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,160
a Notepad feature.

90
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,112
Where is it?

91
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:30,939


92
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,699
Tell me.

93
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:33,199
Left?

94
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,997
Right?

95
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:43,269
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

96
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,240
OLIVER DE WECK: Oh, I see.

97
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,310
So I can't share and use the
Notepad at the same time.

98
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,747
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

99
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:54,788
OLIVER DE WECK: Annotate.

100
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,165
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

101
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:57,290
OLIVER DE WECK: Yeah, yeah.

102
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

103
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,540
OLIVER DE WECK: Stop sharing.

104
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,870
But then they can't see it.

105
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,144
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

106
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:10,560
OLIVER DE WECK:
Can they see this?

107
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,831
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

108
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,415
OLIVER DE WECK: So
you can write text.

109
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:32,759


110
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,995
You can draw shapes.

111
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:41,990


112
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,230
So the reason I want you to
do this on the whiteboard

113
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,620
is such that we can
then go around and look

114
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,019
at some examples.

115
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:56,430
So the assignment is take five
minutes, turn to your partner

116
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,990
and try to describe this system.

117
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,180
And then we'll go around
and look at some--

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,386
we'll sample people's
descriptions.

119
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,271
Go for it.

120
00:06:08,271 --> 00:06:08,770
All right.

121
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:12,250
So keep working
on the assignment

122
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,079
but do it locally
on your computer,

123
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,419
not on the whiteboard.

124
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,189
And then we'll sort of discuss
it and share it and maybe

125
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:22,719
not use the
whiteboard, because I

126
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,170
didn't realize there's only one
whiteboard that we all share.

127
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,420
I thought that you have
individually the whiteboard

128
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,300
and then you can sort of pass
it on to different people.

129
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,210
So if you do it locally
on your machine,

130
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,199
then we can share the
screen so it'll work.

131
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,849
So do it in do it in PowerPoint,
or Word, or sketchpad,

132
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,352
or anything you want.

133
00:06:44,351 --> 00:06:45,060
Sorry about that.

134
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,949


135
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:51,449
All right.

136
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,233
So let's do this.

137
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,899
We're going to sort
of go back and forth

138
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,169
between here and EPFL.

139
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,960
Let's start maybe
over here with Narek.

140
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,430
Are you ready?

141
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,689
So I'm going to
give you the ball,

142
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:10,480
and then you can
sort of explain how

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,689
you guys describe the system.

144
00:07:13,689 --> 00:07:16,089
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: So
what we decided to do

145
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:23,469
was identify the primary
function of Mr. Sticky.

146
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,510
So the primary function is
to trap the fly, we thought.

147
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,730
This is enabled by a
couple of other functions

148
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,560
that are sort of at a
lower layer of abstraction.

149
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,220
It's attracting the fly,
immobilizing the fly,

150
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,010
transporting the
objects to where

151
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,879
you need to immobilize the
fly, and deploying Mr. Sticky.

152
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,790
And we mapped this
to the physical forms

153
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,960
that enable the function.

154
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,209
So the canister, the
physical form of the canister

155
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:51,879
is helping with the
transporting function.

156
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,860
The sticky tape is helping
with the immobilizing function.

157
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,650
The scented
material, we thought,

158
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,689
would be helping for
the attracting function.

159
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,509
And the hook maybe on top
that you use to hang it

160
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:03,039
would help with the deploying.

161
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,860
OLIVER DE WECK: OK.

162
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,360
Good.

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,420
So nice function
form separation.

164
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,830
And you used primarily text,
human language to describe it.

165
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:14,709
So let's see, at EPFL,
who would like to share?

166
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,704


167
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:19,870
And we'll give you the ball.

168
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,059


169
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:22,600
AUDIENCE: OK.

170
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,610
We can try maybe.

171
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,650
OLIVER DE WECK: Who is speaking?

172
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,649
AUDIENCE: Maxim.

173
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,733
OLIVER DE WECK: Maxim, OK.

174
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,549
Can we give the ball to Maxim?

175
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,389
AUDIENCE: Yes.

176
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:34,298
Do you see something?

177
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:35,622
OLIVER DE WECK: Yeah, its good.

178
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:36,539
AUDIENCE: Oh, perfect.

179
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:42,710
So we draw like the same system
when deployed and undeployed.

180
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,720
So we begin with a container
containing basically

181
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,940
the sticky setup rolled.

182
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,980
Then when unrolled,
we have the container

183
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,056
that should be linked to the
sticky setup, the [INAUDIBLE]

184
00:08:54,056 --> 00:08:55,190
whatever.

185
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,670
And then we have like an
external input from the insects

186
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,995
that were, that come to--

187
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,414
we it sticked onto the--

188
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:07,075


189
00:09:07,076 --> 00:09:11,870
OLIVER DE WECK: Yeah, go ahead

190
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,730
AUDIENCE: OK.

191
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,920
So that's all.

192
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:17,419
OLIVER DE WECK:
So I'll note here

193
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,250
that you guys used graphics.

194
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,960
You used some kind of
graphical language.

195
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,570
And at the highest
level, you have--

196
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,360
it's like a state
diagram, rolled, unrolled.

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,940
So you showed the system
in two different states.

198
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,680
Very nice.

199
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,750
Somebody else here
on the MIT side,

200
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,620
and then we'll go
back one more time.

201
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,789
Who would like to share here?

202
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:38,009
Lucille?

203
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,730
OK.

204
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,129
So let's--

205
00:09:42,129 --> 00:09:48,580
AUDIENCE: So we did a diagram
showing the use of Mr. Sticky.

206
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,560
So we have a user
because Mr. Sticky

207
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,329
has to be rolled and
unrolled-- well, unrolled.

208
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,110
The user installs or
disposes of Mr. Sticky.

209
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,500
The flies are attracted to-- or
Mr. Sticky attracts the flies,

210
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,539
and the flies stick
to Mr. Sticky.

211
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:06,250
And then we did
compose Mr. Sticky

212
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,889
into the different
components that

213
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:11,799
are below at a lower level.

214
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:14,709
And yeah, so it's basically at
a higher level of use diagram.

215
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,670
OLIVER DE WECK: OK.

216
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:19,149
So here we have, again,
a graphical description.

217
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,889
The states are sort of implied.

218
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:25,679
But you're focusing on
decomposition, the elements.

219
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,949
Very nice.

220
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,250
Anybody else at EPFL?

221
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,215
Did anybody just write a
paragraph of text, or more

222
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,610
of, like, sentences?

223
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,406


224
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:39,669
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

225
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:41,620
OLIVER DE WECK: At EPFL,
who wants to share?

226
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,810


227
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,819
AUDIENCE: Chris here.

228
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,540
OLIVER DE WECK: Chris, OK.

229
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:49,629
AUDIENCE: So we
didn't write the text.

230
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:55,149
The text seems a bit heavy
to convey a description

231
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,069
in efficient terms.

232
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,120
What we prefer to do is
decompose in elements

233
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:09,679
and for each element
give some properties.

234
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:10,889
OLIVER DE WECK: OK.

235
00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:13,699
And did you do this
in the form of a list,

236
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,790
or in the form of a table?

237
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:19,370
Or how did you
actually describe it?

238
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,120
AUDIENCE: So wait.

239
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,860
I'm trying to share the screen.

240
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,746
OLIVER DE WECK: OK.

241
00:11:22,746 --> 00:11:23,579
AUDIENCE: All right.

242
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,520
So we just worked on
the first half here.

243
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,029
We have the band.

244
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:29,789
And we give here properties.

245
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,179
Those that have to be made
of paper or soft material

246
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:40,719
has to be 1 to 1.5 meters
long, 3 to 5 centimeters large.

247
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
It needs to have a coating which
itself is a sticky material,

248
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,125
and be centered in
order to attract flies.

249
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,299
It needs to have visible color.

250
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:57,959
And then, well, the other part
here, which I'm highlighting,

251
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,100
would be related to
the packaging, so

252
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,430
a self-sealing linear container
with a single-use opening,

253
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,819
including a hanger.

254
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,530
We'd possibly give
branding on the packaging

255
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:16,620
and, well, the
non-toxic material

256
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,685
would refer to the
sticky material.

257
00:12:20,684 --> 00:12:21,809
OLIVER DE WECK: Good, good.

258
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,709
Thank you very much.

259
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,830
This is great.

260
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,879
So what you showed,
that's more like a list.

261
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,289
And I would
describe-- this looks

262
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,769
like what I would call
a bill of materials.

263
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,970
It's essentially a list
of the primary elements

264
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,500
of form of the system.

265
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,470
But there are some attributes
that are associated.

266
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,529
So this is a list format in
the form of a bill of materials

267
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:47,990
with attributes attached.

268
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,570
So thank you very much.

269
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,770
That's great.

270
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,720
So I'm going to
share here again.

271
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,180
And you're probably
wondering what the heck?

272
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,149
Why did we do this?

273
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:03,470
Why did we do this exercise?

274
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:10,450
And that's the point
I want to make next.

275
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,400
So here's a very simple system.

276
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,340
And we have four
examples of descriptions

277
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,470
that were quite different.

278
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,960
And of course, if
you had more time,

279
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,379
they'd become more complete.

280
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:23,169
But they would be
really different.

281
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:27,009
So this is
fundamentally the issue

282
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,689
that we've been
facing in systems

283
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,520
engineering for a long time.

284
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,980
The means for describing
our artifacts,

285
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,230
whether it's something
as simple as a Mr.

286
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,560
Sticky, or an airplane,
or a spacecraft,

287
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,439
or a medical device,
or even a service,

288
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,510
how would we describe it?

289
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:44,529
Well, first of all,
natural language,

290
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,669
the human natural language.

291
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:50,439
And as we know, the human
natural language is very rich.

292
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,140
There's very different
ways in which

293
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,710
we can express, essentially,
the same facts, the same things.

294
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:01,759
That's a wonderful thing if
you're a poet or a writer.

295
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,610
But it makes system
engineering challenging,

296
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,269
because it gets
confusing when we're

297
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:11,509
describing the same thing
in very different ways.

298
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:14,210
Or graphical, so
we saw some boxes,

299
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,050
and we saw some great
examples, sketches, drawings.

300
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,339
So fundamentally, the
way we describe systems--

301
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,670
and this gets to the left half
and right half of the brain--

302
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,399
is using language, words,
sentences, lists, or graphical.

303
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,009
Those are the two fundamental
ways of describing systems.

304
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,269
And then we put all these
descriptions together

305
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:41,480
in what we've been
calling documents.

306
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,129
We aggregate this in documents.

307
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:46,879
So examples of documents would
be a requirements document.

308
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,909
That's what, essentially,
you're doing in Assignment 2.

309
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:55,129
Or a drawing package,
even if it's in CAD,

310
00:14:55,129 --> 00:14:59,149
it's still essentially
a document.

311
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,669
So typically in system
engineering all of this

312
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:06,659
gets assembled into what we call
a TDP, Technical Data Package.

313
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:09,620
And fundamentally, when
you're designing a new system,

314
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,450
you're producing
a technical data

315
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,340
package that has software
drawings, descriptions.

316
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,560
And that's the deliverable
from the design process,

317
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,439
is this TDP, Technical
Data Package.

318
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,040
And from that, you should then
be able to build and operate

319
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,449
the system with as few errors,
mistakes, misunderstandings

320
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:30,830
as possible.

321
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,590
And fundamentally,
as our systems

322
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,780
have been getting more
and more complex--

323
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:38,179
we're now talking
about the systems

324
00:15:38,179 --> 00:15:42,049
that need the three, four,
five layers of decomposition--

325
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:45,769
it's very easy to have
errors, omissions,

326
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:48,779
different interpretations
of this information.

327
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,059
So that's fundamentally--
but there are advantages.

328
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:56,539
I don't want to say
it's categorically

329
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:00,139
bad to use natural
language and graphics.

330
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,080
They're definitely an advantage,
familiarity to the creator

331
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,950
of the description.

332
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,180
So it's easy.

333
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:05,959
It's comfortable.

334
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,430
It feels familiar.

335
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:09,500
And also it's not
confining, so you

336
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,190
can be quite creative
by creating descriptions

337
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,240
in this way.

338
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,669
But the list of
disadvantages is quite

339
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:21,079
long for allowing an
arbitrary description, room

340
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,930
for ambiguous
interpretations and errors.

341
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:25,829
It's quite difficult to update.

342
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,950
So if you make a change
in one description,

343
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,020
that change will
not automatically

344
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,960
propagate to the
other descriptions.

345
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,900
Handing off these descriptions
from one lifecycle phase

346
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,480
to another, there's
discontinuities

347
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,340
in these hand-offs.

348
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,300
Uneven level of abstraction,
so what I mean by that is you

349
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:47,990
may describe one part of the
system, and very detailed.

350
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,945
So the last example
we saw with the list,

351
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,320
with the bill of
materials, there

352
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,810
was quite a bit of
detail there on the scent

353
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:59,319
and the attributes of the tape.

354
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,670
But one of the other--
at least a couple

355
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:04,250
of the other descriptions
didn't have that level of detail

356
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,750
when it came to the tape.

357
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,358
So the level of
abstraction could

358
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:13,009
be quite different in the
different ways to describe it.

359
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,470
And then for a
complex system, you

360
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,098
can imagine that the amount
of volume of information

361
00:17:19,098 --> 00:17:20,000
grows a lot.

362
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,380
And so you can walk into any
program manager and systems

363
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,260
engineers office
and see bookshelves

364
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:30,500
full of binders, dozens
and dozens of binders

365
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,859
with documents, thousands
and thousands of pages.

366
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,379
And many of them are never read.

367
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,240
That's the big issue.

368
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,880
So that's been the
kind of way in which

369
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,330
we've been doing system
engineering traditionally.

370
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,990
So the idea here
is that in order

371
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,893
to mitigate-- yes, Justice.

372
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:58,759
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

373
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,549
OLIVER DE WECK: Phase
A, conceptual design.

374
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,759
Phase B, preliminary
and detail design.

375
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,259
Phase C is testing and launch.

376
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,460
Phase E is operation.

377
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,590
So usually not the same
people do conceptual design,

378
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,179
preliminary design testing.

379
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,580
So all the technical
data package,

380
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:21,939
these artifacts have to be
transferred and handed off

381
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,360
to new people who then
work on the next phase.

382
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,849
That's what I mean by hand-offs.

383
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:33,379
And, yeah, so the
idea is in order

384
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,630
to mitigate some of
these disadvantages

385
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,960
of natural language and
graphical description,

386
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,940
there has been, and
this has been recognized

387
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:47,710
for a long time, a need to
be more precise, perhaps more

388
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,650
confining, but to
create languages

389
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:56,120
that allow us to describe
systems much more precisely.

390
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,689
And so I'll mention a
couple of the past efforts.

391
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,090
And you can read about these.

392
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:03,129
Each of these has--

393
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,920
so I'll mention bond
graphs first, 1960.

394
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,800
This was actually
invented here at MIT

395
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,849
by a professor in
mechanical engineering.

396
00:19:13,849 --> 00:19:15,319
His name was Henry Paynter.

397
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:18,319
Professor Paynter
created bond graphs.

398
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,839
You can think of bond
graphs as block diagrams

399
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,919
where different blocks have
ports or interfaces where

400
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,160
information, material,
energy flows in and out.

401
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,670
And you can compose a
system out of these blocks.

402
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,860
These bond graphs
are essentially--

403
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:38,029
and Narik will talk
about Modelica,

404
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,970
which is sort of a modern
version of bond graphs.

405
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,819
It has other features, too.

406
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:46,429
But this has been
sort of one attempt.

407
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,880
Another one that's very
well-known is IDEF, I-D-E-F,

408
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,470
about 20 years later.

409
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:56,630
This was created by the Air
Force, the US Air Force.

410
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,640
And this is essentially
a description

411
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,190
of systems that's very
functionally oriented.

412
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,500
So it shows you what
functions are involved.

413
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
And we saw one of
the descriptions

414
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,789
was very functionally
oriented, and how

415
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:12,659
the functions of the system
relate to each other.

416
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,580
But generally these
system languages

417
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:19,069
have not fully been deployed.

418
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,889
Some organizations use
them, others don't use them.

419
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,830
And the main reason
for that is twofold.

420
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:27,750
First of all, some of these
languages were incomplete.

421
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,529
They would focus only on
one aspect, like functions

422
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,940
or the block nature of the
system, the block diagrams.

423
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,039
And a lot of them
were not executable.

424
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,579
So they would be graphical,
but you couldn't actually

425
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:43,669
simulate and actually check
whether that description was

426
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,800
complete or accurate.

427
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:49,259
So since then-- and
the other thing,

428
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,099
of course, important
is domain agnostic.

429
00:20:52,099 --> 00:20:55,490
So what I mean by this is that
the system modeling language

430
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,359
should be applicable for any
kind of cyber physical system.

431
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,589
Again, if you're designing
a spacecraft, an aircraft,

432
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:06,409
medical device, any
kind of product,

433
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,330
the language shouldn't
have to be adapted.

434
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:10,970
The language sort of covers
all these applications.

435
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,500
That's the idea.

436
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,779
So whatever language it is that
you're using or developing,

437
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,480
it has to have
these three things.

438
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
Any language has
these three things.

439
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,230
So the first is ontology.

440
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,264
And I reference here
the Wikipedia articles

441
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:27,929
on these things.

442
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,009
Some of my colleagues-- in
academia it's a big debate

443
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:35,119
is Wikipedia a legitimate source
of information or is it not?

444
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,039
My position on
this is that it is.

445
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,339
I think Wikipedia is
definitely not perfect,

446
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:42,619
depending on what topic
you're looking at,

447
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,439
but it's a sort of
self-correcting system.

448
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799
So I actually go to Wikipedia,
and then there's references.

449
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,309
And you can dive deeper.

450
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,889
So I give you the
Wikipedia links

451
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,190
here for these three things.

452
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,110
First, ontology.

453
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:59,519
So ontology is a
very fancy word.

454
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:01,430
What ontology actually is--

455
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,820
Mark, why don't
you come up here?

456
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:06,109
You're an instructor today.

457
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:11,509
Ontology, fundamentally,
is describing the entities

458
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:16,430
that are allowed to exist in
the language, subjects, nouns,

459
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:21,870
adverbs, what are the objects,
the entities, that can exist.

460
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:25,009
So it's a kind of
very abstract thing.

461
00:22:25,009 --> 00:22:28,309
But it's essentially the
library of words and objects

462
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:31,849
that are allowed to
exist in that language

463
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,240
and then how these entities
can be grouped perhaps

464
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,289
in a hierarchy and subdivided.

465
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,159
So it essentially
constrains the universe

466
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,430
of things you can
describe in that language.

467
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,860
The shorter, the smaller
your ontology is,

468
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,740
the more confined the language.

469
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,329
Semantics.

470
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:57,799
Semantics is basically a branch
of science of philosophy, which

471
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,430
is fundamentally assigning
meaning to those objects that

472
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,380
are described in the ontology.

473
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,980
And so the way
that we say this is

474
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,360
that it's the relationship
between the signifiers,

475
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:14,269
so the signifiers are
words, letters, symbols,

476
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:16,069
graphical symbols.

477
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:18,379
So how do we describe a
resistor, for example,

478
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:21,080
in electrical engineering?

479
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:22,009
A squiggly line.

480
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,000
It's the zigzag line.

481
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,140
Well, if you don't know
electrical engineering,

482
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,850
you just see a squiggly line.

483
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,649
It's meaningless to you.

484
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,710
But if you know that
semantically that

485
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,829
means that's a resistor,
that's the symbol for resistor,

486
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,929
that's what we
mean by semantics.

487
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,150
And then the third is syntax.

488
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,090
What is syntax?

489
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,339
It's the set of rules, the set
of principles and processes

490
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:51,709
by which the objects or the
entities in the ontology

491
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,319
can be combined to
build up higher level

492
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:59,460
information, like sentences,
paragraphs, and so forth.

493
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,900
And so that's essentially
the construction rules

494
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,769
for the language.

495
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:07,579
So every language has
these three things.

496
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,039
So any questions
about this before we

497
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:12,609
move into our first language?

498
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:15,000
So we're going to give three
examples of system modeling

499
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,089
languages, and you'll see the
similarities and differences.

500
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,029
But as you see these
languages, keep in mind they

501
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:25,990
all have ontology,
semantics, and syntax.

502
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,329
Any questions about that?

503
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:30,269


504
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,490
So OPM.

505
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,200
Let me describe to you OPM.

506
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,160
This is one of the
younger languages.

507
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,970
And so OPM stands for
Object Process Methodology.

508
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:47,970
And it was created by
Professor Dov Dori at Technion,

509
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,620
a colleague of mine.

510
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:52,919
Dov is essentially a computer
scientist by training.

511
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,340
And you'll see the
heritage here of OPM.

512
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,089
And the big news
here about OPM is

513
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:02,579
OPM is not that well-known yet.

514
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:06,869
If you ask around, not
too many people know OPM.

515
00:25:06,869 --> 00:25:09,059
But I predict that
in the next decade

516
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,169
that will change very quickly.

517
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:13,800
And one of the reasons
is that OPM was just

518
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,589
now adopted as an ISO standard.

519
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:19,799
And if you know ISO, the
International Standards

520
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:22,159
Organization, they're
located in Geneva,

521
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,910
it's a big deal to
become an ISO standard.

522
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,880
It took like five years,
the whole process,

523
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,830
with committees and reviews.

524
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:32,279
And so the ISO
standard is actually--

525
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:35,069
OPM was adopted
as an ISO standard

526
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:39,629
as a means to describe and
develop other standards.

527
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:43,380
So it's kind of a metalanguage
because, as you can imagine,

528
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,870
when you read different
standards which, by the way,

529
00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:48,479
have a lot of
influence, they're also

530
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,759
written in natural
language and graphics

531
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,210
and lots of inconsistencies.

532
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,170
So the idea is that future
ISO standards should

533
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,310
be written using OPM such that
they're clear and consistent,

534
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:01,419
and so forth.

535
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:07,170
So the history here is
that if we go back further,

536
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,960
UML, which is Unified Modeling
Language which I'm not

537
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,809
going to talk about
today, is a software--

538
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,059
this is a language that
was developed primarily

539
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,779
for software engineering
to consistently describe

540
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,079
use cases, to
consistently describe

541
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:27,419
activity and flows in software,
the structure of software.

542
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,400
But it's really
software centric.

543
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,970
So from UML 2.0, we then
sort of branched off

544
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,049
into SysML, which Mark
Chodas, who just joined us

545
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:41,549
will talk about, and then OPM.

546
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:43,740
So these are sort of
derivatives of UML.

547
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,250
And there's a book, it's not
one of the mandatory books

548
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,400
for this class, OPM 2002.

549
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,170
If you're really
interested in OPM,

550
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:54,420
I recommend you
invest in that book.

551
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,420
It's really very well written.

552
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:03,990
So let me give you an example
of how OPM can be used.

553
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,720
So like we said, typical
product representations

554
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,660
are sketches, engineering
drawings, or UML diagrams

555
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:14,880
and software, but the need
for a unified representation.

556
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,560
And fundamentally,
we have functions

557
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:23,190
and then we have objects,
form and function, in systems.

558
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,269
And so what we would like to
do, and the premise of OPM,

559
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:33,119
is that we can show everything
in one diagram type,

560
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,369
so the functions, the functional
attributes, the objects,

561
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,829
and there's different
types of objects, operands,

562
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:44,129
system components,
consumables, the attributes

563
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,410
of those objects,
and then the links.

564
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,000
And I'll show you
the different types

565
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
of links between these
that exist in OPM.

566
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,220
So it's a generic
modeling language.

567
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,140
And it has been
successfully applied

568
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,930
to system architecting
of complex products

569
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,730
in different organizations.

570
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,319
I'm going to try to give you
a pretty simple example here,

571
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,819
which is a refrigerator.

572
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,750
So we're going to
look at a small kind

573
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,859
of household-level refrigerator
through the eyes of OPM.

574
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,359
All right.

575
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:16,049
So here's the basic
ontology of OPM.

576
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:18,029
It's very, very simple.

577
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:24,180
And that's the idea, is to have
as few objects, as few entities

578
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,450
as possible in the
language to keep it simple.

579
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:31,350
So the first one is
the idea of an object.

580
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,789
What is an object?

581
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:35,819
Objects are drawn
as these rectangles.

582
00:28:35,819 --> 00:28:39,839
Objects are defined
as entities that

583
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,490
have the potential for stable,
unconditional existence

584
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,160
for some positive
duration of time.

585
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,710
And objects have
states within them.

586
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,360
So what would be an
example of an object

587
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,205
that we've talked about today?

588
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,094
Go ahead.

589
00:28:58,095 --> 00:28:59,640
AUDIENCE: Maybe the sticky tape.

590
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,230
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so
the sticky tape itself.

591
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,950
That's an object.

592
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,990
It exists unconditionally.

593
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,009
It's there.

594
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:09,039
And what's important is it
could be a physical object.

595
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,279
So it has a physical existence.

596
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,119
But it could also be a sort
of informational object.

597
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:21,750
So for example, if you
have an idea or a vision,

598
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,920
that's an object, too.

599
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,560
It's not physical in that
sense, but it does exist

600
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:29,009
as an informational object.

601
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,599
What are states?

602
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,859
Let's see at EPFL.

603
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:34,500
What would be an example
of a state that's

604
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,849
associated with an object?

605
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:43,769


606
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:46,339
Yeah, that's OK.

607
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:49,039
Can somebody give an
example of a state?

608
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,514
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

609
00:29:50,515 --> 00:29:52,469
Rolled and unrolled
for the sticky tape.

610
00:29:52,469 --> 00:29:54,009
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Rolled and unrolled.

611
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,309
Exactly.

612
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:56,789
Or furled and unfurled.

613
00:29:56,789 --> 00:30:01,099
So that's kind of a binary state
that could be halfway unrolled,

614
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:06,829
or the sticky tape is full of
flies, or it's kind of empty.

615
00:30:06,829 --> 00:30:10,189
Those would be describing the
object in terms of what state

616
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:10,850
it is in.

617
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:11,929
Exactly.

618
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,930
So the form is then the
sum of all these objects.

619
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,560


620
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,559
So that's one building block.

621
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,799
And then processes
are the other.

622
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:23,361
So what are processes?

623
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:24,570
Oh, is there another example?

624
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:25,189
Yeah, go ahead.

625
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,480
AUDIENCE: May I ask a question?

626
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,670
OLIVIER DE WECK: Is
this [INAUDIBLE]??

627
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:28,970
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's [INAUDIBLE]..

628
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,299
OLIVIER DE WECK: Go ahead.

629
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:33,629
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
by positive duration of time?

630
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,020
OLIVIER DE WECK: Well,
meaning that the object

631
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:37,879
could be created.

632
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,450
It didn't exist before.

633
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,450
It's created, and it exists.

634
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,640
And then it could
be destroyed again.

635
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,520
It could disappear, or
it could be consumed.

636
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,259
But it means that
the object needs

637
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:53,000
to exist for a non-zero
period of time in order

638
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,980
for it to be called
an object, so objects

639
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:02,640
in the world that can
be described with OPM,

640
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,610
fundamentally, objects
can be created.

641
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,969
Objects can be modified,
particularly their states

642
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,420
can be modified.

643
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,610
And they can be
destroyed or consumed.

644
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,119
That's basically it.

645
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:18,759
That's a complete set.

646
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,769
Does that make sense?

647
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:24,509
So processes are--
what are processes?

648
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,180
Processes are
really fundamentally

649
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,289
different from objects.

650
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:30,559
Processes are shown
as these ellipses.

651
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,740
And they're the patterns
of transformation

652
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,509
applied to one or more objects.

653
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:37,430
And processes change states.

654
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:42,170
So processes, unlike objects,
cannot exist on their own.

655
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,220
Processes only make sense
if they're associated

656
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,860
with at least one object.

657
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:51,469
So processes are essentially--

658
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,720
the functions that
we develop in systems

659
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,500
are processes that transform
or create, destroy,

660
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,440
or transform objects.

661
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,910
So function emerges from
one or more processes.

662
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,769
And then we have different links
between objects and processes.

663
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,129
I'll show you two examples here.

664
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,240
One is the arrow
with a pointy head.

665
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:18,799
That could be a consumption
or production type link,

666
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,450
or a link with this
little lollipop symbol.

667
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,779
This is known as
an instrument link.

668
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:29,690
And so the difference there
is that if an object is linked

669
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,990
to a process using an arrow,
it means that something's

670
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,460
happening to that object.

671
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:37,370
It's being created, or
destroyed, or modified.

672
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:40,609
If an object is linked to a
process using the lollipop

673
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:43,129
symbol, the instrument
link, it means

674
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,450
that in order for that process
to happen this object is

675
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,309
needed, it's an instrument.

676
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,349
But the object itself,
the instrument,

677
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:55,199
does not get modified in
any way by the process.

678
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,529
But the process couldn't happen
if that object didn't exist.

679
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:01,180
Do you see the difference?

680
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,490
And so one of the really,
I think, important things

681
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:06,359
about OPM, but any
of the languages,

682
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:10,000
is that every box,
every arrow, every link

683
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,640
has precise semantics.

684
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,917
And usually when
we kind of doodle,

685
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:16,000
when we just think about--

686
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
we put arrows and
links between boxes,

687
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,920
we often don't
really deeply think

688
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,990
when I put a link in here, what
does that link actually mean?

689
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,779
What does that link imply?

690
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,839
So when you do system modeling
using these languages,

691
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,419
you become much,
much more precise.

692
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,410
Yes, please.

693
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,431
And would you push
the mic button?

694
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:34,930
Yeah.

695
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,400
Mark, go ahead.

696
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,680
AUDIENCE: Can an object
be a process or a process

697
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,519
be an object?

698
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,779
OLIVIER DE WECK: No.

699
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,579
AUDIENCE: So what
about if you have--

700
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,669
I guess I'm thinking
in terms of if there's

701
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,410
some process for
doing some procedure

702
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,769
and like you're assembling
a satellite or whatnot.

703
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,389
You need to modify that process.

704
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,990
So how is that sort of
thing represented in OPM?

705
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,870
OLIVIER DE WECK: The
process modifies objects,

706
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:05,259
but processes cannot
modify other processes

707
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:08,739
because processes are
fundamentally, in OPM,

708
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:11,159
acting upon the objects.

709
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,389
Now, processes can
invoke each other.

710
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:16,010
So if there's a
sequence of processes--

711
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,389
you have to do this assembly
step before this other assembly

712
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:19,989
step--

713
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:24,139
you can have what's
called an invocation link.

714
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:26,539
But that's a logical
dependency between processes.

715
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:30,347
But fundamentally, the processes
act through the objects in OPM.

716
00:34:30,347 --> 00:34:30,889
AUDIENCE: OK.

717
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:35,186


718
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,309
OLIVIER DE WECK: So let's
go into some more detail.

719
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,190
So at a high level when you
look at the economy, products--

720
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,813
yes, go ahead.

721
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:45,980
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

722
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:50,788
Why create another language
and not just stick with UML?

723
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,204
OLIVIER DE WECK:
So good question.

724
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:54,769


725
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:59,630
So we'll talk about SysML,
which is very similar to UML.

726
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,660
It's sort of generalized for
cyber-physical systems, not

727
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:05,019
just software.

728
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,630
So the reason that OPM
was created, because UML

729
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,450
was found to be
somewhat too confining.

730
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:14,689
This is more general
and also the idea

731
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:20,030
of a unified representation, one
type of diagram and description

732
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,460
for any application.

733
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,110
So it's basically a kind of a
more general version of UML.

734
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,599
But the other really
important thing about OPM

735
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,480
is that objects and
processes are sort of--

736
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,889
the processes are often in
object-oriented thinking.

737
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:40,019
Processes are embedded
inside objects.

738
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,699
And in OPM, the
processes have been

739
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:47,639
emancipated to stand at
the same level as objects.

740
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,639
Those are the main differences.

741
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,139
So let me go in a
little bit more detail.

742
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:58,339
So if you think about the
economy in general, goods

743
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:04,100
and services, goods are objects,
and services are processes.

744
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:13,730
So if you buy a new iPad, or a
new pencil, or whatever it is,

745
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:16,070
you're actually
buying an object.

746
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,390
You're purchasing an object.

747
00:36:17,389 --> 00:36:19,429
That's obvious.

748
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,659
But why are you
purchasing that object?

749
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:24,379


750
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:28,340
So let's say you're
buying a new tablet.

751
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,400
You're buying the tablet.

752
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,309
But why are you
buying the tablet?

753
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:35,552
Sam, go ahead.

754
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:39,124


755
00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:40,539
AUDIENCE: You're
buying the tablet

756
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:44,500
to perform an action for a
process on something else,

757
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,449
to do something.

758
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:45,669
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

759
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,840
So what do tablets do?

760
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:52,559
I mean, not stone tablets,
but modern tablets.

761
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,529
AUDIENCE: They allow you to
work with software, communicate.

762
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so
they're information processing.

763
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,330
They're information-processing
devices.

764
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:03,969
And there's an
argument with tablets

765
00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:05,659
are great for
consuming information.

766
00:37:05,659 --> 00:37:09,639
They're maybe not as good for
generating new information.

767
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,489
So fundamentally, you're
purchasing the tablet,

768
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:16,779
which is an object,
in order to be

769
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,600
able to do information
processing and information

770
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,679
consumption.

771
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:22,629
So the process is then implicit.

772
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:25,210


773
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:28,300
What's an example-- if you
purchase a service, what would

774
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,002
be an example of a service?

775
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:33,306


776
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:37,480
What would be an
example of a service?

777
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,590
Let's see at EPFL.

778
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,269
What would be an
example of a service

779
00:37:40,269 --> 00:37:41,269
that you could purchase?

780
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:47,248


781
00:37:47,248 --> 00:37:48,539
AUDIENCE: Going to the dentist.

782
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,123
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Going to the dentist.

783
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:53,851
Yeah, one of our
favorite things to do.

784
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:55,059
Have you been there recently?

785
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:58,453


786
00:37:58,454 --> 00:38:00,280
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one month ago.

787
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,340
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
I don't want to be--

788
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,320
I don't want to
violate your privacy,

789
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,710
but can you share with us
what happened at the dentist?

790
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,460
AUDIENCE: It's the
yearly checkup.

791
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,139
You have to check that
there's no hidden--

792
00:38:16,139 --> 00:38:19,206
I don't know how you call
that in English, carries?

793
00:38:19,206 --> 00:38:20,539
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, cavities.

794
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:21,315
Yeah.

795
00:38:21,315 --> 00:38:22,740
AUDIENCE: Yeah, cavities.

796
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,469
Check that wisdom
tooth don't mess up

797
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:28,709
what you've been working
on tirelessly when

798
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,369
you were younger with braces.

799
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:34,605
And [INAUDIBLE] get checked.

800
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:35,730
OLIVIER DE WECK: Very good.

801
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,985
So going to the dentist.

802
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:39,809
The dentist provides
a service which

803
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:42,809
is either checking
your teeth or filling

804
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:45,239
cavities, which is a process.

805
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,519
And all the objects, the
chair on which you sit,

806
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,199
the instruments--

807
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,129
I guess we still use gold
sometimes in some places--

808
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,490
those are objects that are
used in the performance

809
00:38:56,489 --> 00:38:57,449
of the service.

810
00:38:57,449 --> 00:38:59,609
You see the relationship?

811
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,700
So objects and processes
always come in pairs.

812
00:39:02,699 --> 00:39:04,649
Thank you for that example.

813
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:08,670
So let me talk about the
links in OPM briefly.

814
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,789
So there are two types.

815
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:13,800
There's the structural links,
which link objects to objects.

816
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,740
And we typically use arrows,
you know, is related to

817
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:19,029
or we can tag these as well.

818
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,960
So for example, something
powers something else.

819
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,730
This is known as a tagged link.

820
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,170
It suppresses the processes.

821
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,369
And then there's these
triangles that are--

822
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:31,799
essentially, there's a
kind of hierarchy implied

823
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,910
there and slightly
different meanings.

824
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:38,639
So the solid triangle
means decomposition.

825
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,730
So the higher level
object is composed

826
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,860
of lower-level objects.

827
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,349
So that's, Mark, you
mentioned assembly, you know,

828
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:49,230
are you creating the bus of
the spacecraft and it has

829
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,090
a whole bunch of stuff in it?

830
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,640
Well, you would use
this filled in triangle

831
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:55,440
to show that decomposition.

832
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,260
The second example is the
characterization link.

833
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,820
So this is essentially
relating an attribute

834
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,150
to its kind of master object.

835
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,289
Specialization
and generalization

836
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:09,150
is the empty triangle.

837
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,389
And then this funny symbol
here is instantiation.

838
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:17,543
So essentially, you
have a general object.

839
00:40:17,543 --> 00:40:18,960
And then you can
instantiate that.

840
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,559
So I have two children.

841
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,139
I have two children,
which is general.

842
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:27,759
And there's two
instantiations of them.

843
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,130
One of them is called Gabrielle.

844
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,628
And one of them is
called Christian.

845
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,549
And they're actual people.

846
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,880
So that's the idea
of instantiation.

847
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,740
Processes.

848
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:41,519
Processes are these
patterns of transformation.

849
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,599
They're tricky.

850
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,569
Processes are trickier to
understand than the objects

851
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,059
because we cannot hold
or touch a process.

852
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,730
It's fleeting.

853
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:53,519
And the creating change
or destruction of objects

854
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:55,769
is what processes do.

855
00:40:55,769 --> 00:40:58,650
They rely on at least
one object in what

856
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,769
we call the preprocess set.

857
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:03,690
A process transforms
at least one object.

858
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,840
And the time is implied.

859
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,329
So processes take
along a timeline.

860
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:12,179
And in terms of the
description, in English

861
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,669
we use the so-called
Gerund form.

862
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,220
So all the processes,
there's some examples

863
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:22,049
on the right side, use
the "ing" form of a verb.

864
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,190
So we can then put
these together, objects

865
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,550
and processes.

866
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,010
So here's an example
of a machine.

867
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,890
This happens to be like a
printer or copy machine.

868
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,469
It has a main switch.

869
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:36,289
The main switch has an
attribute called Main Switch

870
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:39,679
State, which can be on or off.

871
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:42,799
The process of
switching transforms,

872
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,490
in this case, the Main
Switch State from on to off.

873
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:48,289
Or we could go the other way.

874
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,279
And in order for this to
happen, we have here--

875
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,691
this is actually slightly
different than the instrument

876
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:55,189
link.

877
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,349
This is a filled
in lollipop, which

878
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,299
is known as an agent link.

879
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,580
So the operator
is an active agent

880
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:04,069
to carry out the
switching process which

881
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:07,970
changes the main switch state
from on to off or off to on,

882
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:13,429
and the Main Switch State is an
attribute of the main switch.

883
00:42:13,429 --> 00:42:14,719
So transporting.

884
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,309
This is another example.

885
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:20,599
Transporting changes the state
of a person from being here,

886
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:27,259
Location A, to being
there, Location B.

887
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:34,950
So there are seven-- huh,
coincidence, seven, seven--

888
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:37,889
object process links in OPM.

889
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:42,659
So P changes-- the process
changes the object,

890
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,799
say from State A to B. That's
the example we just looked at.

891
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,090
You can actually hide that.

892
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:51,809
If you're really not interested
in all the states and details,

893
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:53,070
you hide the states.

894
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,600
You don't want to see them.

895
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,400
And then you can
replace that with what's

896
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,539
called the affectee link,
which is this two-sided arrow.

897
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:03,449
And all you know is
that this process

898
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,669
is affecting that object.

899
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,500
And it's a two-sided arrow.

900
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,730
But you don't know exactly how
but you know it's affected.

901
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,900
A resultee link-- so this is an
arrow pointing from the process

902
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,280
to the object--

903
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,130
means that the process
of transporting

904
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,160
produces emissions that
weren't there before.

905
00:43:23,159 --> 00:43:24,929
So that's a resultee link.

906
00:43:24,929 --> 00:43:29,159
But the process of transporting
requires or consumes energy.

907
00:43:29,159 --> 00:43:31,440
So the arrow is
pointing from energy

908
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,059
into the transporting process
because it's being consumed.

909
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:37,559
I did mention the agent link.

910
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,570
So there's an
operator of a vehicle.

911
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:43,470
And when we talk about
autonomously driving vehicles,

912
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:46,379
a big topic right now,
actually, it was cool.

913
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,519
At EPA this summer, there's
the autonomous shuttle

914
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,259
on the campus, the
electric shuttle.

915
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,850
Did anybody take that?

916
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:56,125
Did you guys try that
shuttle this summer?

917
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:57,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

918
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:57,630
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah?

919
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,320
Did you like it?

920
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,032


921
00:44:01,032 --> 00:44:01,990
AUDIENCE: No, I didn't.

922
00:44:01,989 --> 00:44:04,569
But a friend is working
in this kind of shuttle,

923
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,280
like sitting for hours waiting
for people [INAUDIBLE]..

924
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,200
OLIVIER DE WECK:
So fundamentally, I

925
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,460
mean, if you want to think
of this in OPM language,

926
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,099
a driverless vehicle is
basically eliminating this,

927
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:21,579
no longer needing an
operator with an agent link

928
00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:24,429
and replacing this with
a piece of software,

929
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:28,669
which would be an
instrument link.

930
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,099
So the instrument, the
transporting process

931
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:32,329
requires a vehicle.

932
00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:35,849
And then we have what's
known as a conditional link.

933
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:39,019
So this process can only
occur if this object

934
00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:40,949
is in that particular state.

935
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,939
So this example here,
obviously, ignores the existence

936
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,039
of credit cards.

937
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,920
So you can do the purchasing.

938
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,230
The process of purchasing is
conditional upon the state

939
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:59,347
of the object money being
in a state of enough

940
00:44:59,347 --> 00:45:00,305
for doing the purchase.

941
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:03,029


942
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,150
So here's an example of a
little bit more complicated.

943
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:11,829
This is a Level 0 OPM diagram
of a car, of a vehicle.

944
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:13,650
So you can see in
the upper right is

945
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,650
sort of a sketch of a vehicle.

946
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:18,680
And it has these
different attributes.

947
00:45:18,679 --> 00:45:23,190
ED is engine displacement,
height, ground clearance,

948
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,860
overall length, wheelbase.

949
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,740
There's a trailer here
with a towing capacity.

950
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:31,469
So the way the way you
would interpret this

951
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,079
is that we have a
transporting process.

952
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:37,710
That's our master, sort of
the highest level process.

953
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,670
And it changes the attribute
location for driver passengers

954
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,639
and cargo from A to B.
And that's, fundamentally,

955
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:49,329
where the value is for
the owner of the vehicle.

956
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,000
And then we can zoom in to
the transporting process

957
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,849
and look at subprocesses,
towing, propelling,

958
00:45:54,849 --> 00:45:55,960
and housing.

959
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,420
And if you think about what
a vehicle does at the highest

960
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:04,869
level, it protects you, it
houses you, and it propels you.

961
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:07,809
And then you can break
those into more detail.

962
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:11,049
And then on the left side
here we have, essentially,

963
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,180
the elements of form.

964
00:46:13,179 --> 00:46:15,339
So the automobile,
which is an instrument

965
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,410
of the transporting
process, can be

966
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:20,769
decomposed into its major
subsystems, powertrain,

967
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:22,739
chassis, body, wheels.

968
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:24,699
And each of those
are characterized--

969
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,529
you see those attribute links--

970
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,630
characterized by things
like fuel capacity,

971
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,190
engine displacement.

972
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,519
This is the design domain
we talked about last time.

973
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,809
Ground clearance.

974
00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:39,909
And so those are the
design variables.

975
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,799
Those are the parts
and assemblies.

976
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,990
And then on the right
side, the processes,

977
00:46:43,989 --> 00:46:48,459
the internal processes can also
be characterized by performance

978
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,670
or functional attributes
like towing capacity,

979
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,460
fuel economy, acceleration.

980
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,000
PV stands for Passenger
Volume and cargo volume.

981
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,760
And those are things when you're
comparing different vehicles

982
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,040
to purchase, those
are the things

983
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:05,019
you would compare
vehicles against.

984
00:47:05,019 --> 00:47:07,329
So they're the internal
functions and then

985
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:09,489
the functional attributes.

986
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:12,969
And then up here there
is the fuel and emissions

987
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,519
and safety-related
issues, which that's often

988
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,699
where the governments
intervene and then regulate.

989
00:47:18,699 --> 00:47:23,799
And this is sort of a highest
level OPM of a vehicle.

990
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,750
And then if you want
to see more detail,

991
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,940
you would start drilling
down into these.

992
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,159
And you'd have multiple
levels of these,

993
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:31,750
like a hierarchy
of these diagrams.

994
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:33,210
Yeah.

995
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,619
AUDIENCE: So here,
what is the use

996
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:39,289
of the-- or the meaning
of the open arrows?

997
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,099
And it looks like there's a
couple of different arrows

998
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,920
here than what we had
in the other diagram.

999
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,063
OLIVIER DE WECK: Are you
talking about these guys?

1000
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:48,666
AUDIENCE: No.

1001
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, these here.

1002
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,329
Yeah.

1003
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:50,954
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1004
00:47:50,954 --> 00:47:52,840
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
it's just a visual

1005
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,250
represent-- there's no
distinction on the arrows

1006
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,780
whether they're
filled in or empty.

1007
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,730
That's just a kind
of graphical thing.

1008
00:47:58,730 --> 00:47:59,230
Yeah.

1009
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,869


1010
00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:04,299
So one of the--

1011
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:04,810
yes.

1012
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:08,259
Veronica, do you
want to push the--

1013
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,850
AUDIENCE: How
would you represent

1014
00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:14,529
a process that creates
kind of a temporary state?

1015
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,210
So if you're saying this
is acted on an object,

1016
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,070
and this changes the
form of the object

1017
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:21,580
but the object will ultimately
return to its original state

1018
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:24,549
kind of absent of a
reversing process,

1019
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:28,269
if it's a natural tendency
for the object to return,

1020
00:48:28,269 --> 00:48:30,304
how would you
represent that change?

1021
00:48:30,304 --> 00:48:31,929
Would you need to
break it down as kind

1022
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:34,402
of a subprocess
within the object?

1023
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:35,360
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

1024
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,240
So I mean, and sometimes
there's multiple,

1025
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:41,109
there's non-uniqueness in sort
of representing the same thing.

1026
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:43,539
But there's one
process that brings you

1027
00:48:43,539 --> 00:48:44,679
to the temporary state.

1028
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:45,220
AUDIENCE: OK.

1029
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:45,789
OLIVIER DE WECK:
And then there would

1030
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:48,309
be a restoring process
that restores you back

1031
00:48:48,309 --> 00:48:49,389
to the original state.

1032
00:48:49,389 --> 00:48:52,389
AUDIENCE: Does the process
have to be a separate plan

1033
00:48:52,389 --> 00:48:53,809
within the system?

1034
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:56,769
Because there are certain
objects that have a tendency--

1035
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:59,050
I'm thinking primarily of
kind of chemical states

1036
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,601
where reactions would
happen naturally.

1037
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:03,099
It's kind of a
specific thing, but I

1038
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,110
was thinking about how you
might model different systems.

1039
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,568
And I was thinking
about the engine

1040
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,550
of the car, just kind of how
things might naturally return.

1041
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:12,580
So do you have to describe
the process explicitly

1042
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:17,650
if it's not something that's
inherently designed in,

1043
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:18,930
if it's kind of a--

1044
00:49:18,929 --> 00:49:21,549
if it will happen anyway.

1045
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:23,380
OLIVIER DE WECK: I
think, I want to say you

1046
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,699
have to explicitly define that.

1047
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:25,240
AUDIENCE: OK.

1048
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:28,839
OLIVIER DE WECK: So if it's a
man-made process, so to speak,

1049
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,990
then that's a process
you want to happen.

1050
00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:33,909
And then if the restoring
it back to some other state

1051
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:37,079
is a natural process,
well, it exists.

1052
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,360
So it will restore the
system to a prior state.

1053
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,280
That process would also
have to be modeled.

1054
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,450
AUDIENCE: Is there a
distinction between how

1055
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:45,939
you would indicate a man-made
process or a natural process?

1056
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,960
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Not fundamentally.

1057
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:47,349
AUDIENCE: OK.

1058
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:48,723
OLIVIER DE WECK:
And in fact, OPM

1059
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:51,200
has been applied to modeling
how a cell functions.

1060
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:53,259
So there's been some
pretty recent work on--

1061
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,770
cells are incredibly-- the
biological engineering is just

1062
00:49:56,769 --> 00:49:58,114
really complex.

1063
00:49:58,114 --> 00:49:59,530
So there's some
really recent work

1064
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,100
on describing even the
RNA and cell division,

1065
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,568
using very much this language.

1066
00:50:04,568 --> 00:50:05,110
AUDIENCE: OK.

1067
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:06,651
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
it doesn't matter

1068
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,856
whether it's an artificial
process or a natural process.

1069
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:10,690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1070
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:12,070
OLIVIER DE WECK: Let me
go a couple more minutes,

1071
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:13,486
and then we'll
take a short break.

1072
00:50:13,485 --> 00:50:16,480
And then we'll talk
about SysML and Modelica.

1073
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,119
So the key thing
in OPM is there's

1074
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,549
only one type of diagram.

1075
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:23,289
And there's also
natural language

1076
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,820
that gets auto-generated.

1077
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,130
And I'll show you this
very quickly in the tool.

1078
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:29,619
So as you can imagine,
as you're working

1079
00:50:29,619 --> 00:50:32,559
on real systems, these
diagrams, if you'd showed them

1080
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,210
on one sort of level, you'd have
thousands of objects and links.

1081
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,829
It would be a mess.

1082
00:50:38,829 --> 00:50:41,049
So how does OPM
handle complexity?

1083
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,090
There's three
fundamental mechanisms.

1084
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,880
One is known as
folding and unfolding.

1085
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,780
What does that mean?

1086
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,980
It's basically related
to the structure.

1087
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:54,760
So folding/unfolding means
that higher level objects, you

1088
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,430
can show the decomposition of
the objects or you can hide it.

1089
00:50:58,429 --> 00:51:00,609
That's known as
folding and unfolding.

1090
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,809
Then the second one is
in-zooming or out-zooming.

1091
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:09,159
And so here's an example of
a process and an instrument

1092
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,149
and an affectee that's
affected by the process.

1093
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:17,000
And I want to know, what are the
subprocesses in that process?

1094
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,099
So you can zoom
into this process,

1095
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:22,029
and it will expose
the subprocesses

1096
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,560
that are happening inside.

1097
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:24,860
That's known as in-zooming.

1098
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,544
And then going back the other
way is called out-zooming.

1099
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,460
And then the third one
I've already mentioned,

1100
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,630
which is that states
can be expressed

1101
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:37,019
or suppressed or hidden
depending on your interest

1102
00:51:37,019 --> 00:51:40,969
and what states of the
system you want to look at.

1103
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,509
So here's the sort of Level
0 OPM of our refrigerator.

1104
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,940
I said that was kind
of our case study.

1105
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,599
So how does the refrigerator
work at the sort of--

1106
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:53,690
Level 0, that's what the
stakeholder, what the customer

1107
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:54,650
sees.

1108
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,480
Don't care about the
details of what's

1109
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,670
happening in the refrigerator.

1110
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,530
So we have food--

1111
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,800
and we'll get back to
this I think next week

1112
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,920
in the kind of creativity
concept generation.

1113
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:10,639
Why do we have
refrigerators fundamentally?

1114
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,179
If you've heard this
before, you keep quiet.

1115
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:15,649
Maybe EPFL.

1116
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,405
Why do we have refrigerators?

1117
00:52:17,405 --> 00:52:21,969


1118
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:22,519
Any ideas?

1119
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:27,210


1120
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,920
Go ahead.

1121
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,150
AUDIENCE: Keep food cold.

1122
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,930
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, well,
if you're a beer drinker,

1123
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:36,239
you want cold beer.

1124
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,000
But if you really
think about it deeply,

1125
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,489
that's not really
the primary reason.

1126
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:46,469
The primary reason is this
state change, their shelf life.

1127
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:48,839
So the primary reason why
you have refrigerators

1128
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,100
is to extend the shelf
life of the food.

1129
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,449
So speaking as a systems
architect, system engineer,

1130
00:52:57,449 --> 00:53:03,829
a refrigerator is a food
spoilage rate reduction device.

1131
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:04,759
You see that?

1132
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,390
So the attribute of the
food is the shelf life,

1133
00:53:08,389 --> 00:53:11,829
and we're going to extend
the shelf life of the food.

1134
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:14,299
If you think about it
sort of architecturally,

1135
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,190
that's why we have
refrigerators.

1136
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:19,280
But I agree with you
on the cold beer.

1137
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,920
We all agree we want
cold beer, not warm beer.

1138
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,059
So you're right.

1139
00:53:23,059 --> 00:53:24,710
You're right, too.

1140
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:27,199
So the refrigerator
essentially is an instrument

1141
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,019
of extending the
food shelf life.

1142
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:32,509
So the food is the operand.

1143
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,310
The food is the operand.

1144
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:36,139
The extending of
shelf life is what

1145
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:38,900
we call the primary
value delivering process.

1146
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,610
That's where the value is.

1147
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:44,269
The refrigerator itself
is the product system.

1148
00:53:44,269 --> 00:53:48,440
And then the operator sets
the thermostat setting

1149
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,200
at which temperature the
refrigerator should be.

1150
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:53,869
And then here we have the
primary operating process,

1151
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:58,339
which is what allows us to keep
the temperature of the food

1152
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:59,690
at that level.

1153
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:02,450
And in order to do this, we
consume electrical power.

1154
00:54:02,449 --> 00:54:04,219
We produce waste heat.

1155
00:54:04,219 --> 00:54:07,819
And we also require, or
we convect that waste heat

1156
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,580
to the exterior air at
a certain temperature.

1157
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:14,572
How well do refrigerators
work in a vacuum chamber?

1158
00:54:14,572 --> 00:54:20,000


1159
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,610
They don't.

1160
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:22,180
They don't.

1161
00:54:22,179 --> 00:54:24,219
There's no way
to-- well, I guess

1162
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,929
you could radiate the
heat a little bit.

1163
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,169
But they're not going
to work very well.

1164
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,740
You're not going
to have conduction

1165
00:54:29,739 --> 00:54:32,199
because you're sort of in the
middle of the vacuum chamber.

1166
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:33,489
You're not going
to have convection.

1167
00:54:33,489 --> 00:54:34,750
So you only have radiation.

1168
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,039
And that's not going
to work very well.

1169
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:42,309
So the exterior air is important
for the refrigerator to work.

1170
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:43,719
So then you say, well, OK.

1171
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:44,559
That's fine.

1172
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,579
I buy that.

1173
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:48,519
But now I want to really
know, how does it really work?

1174
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:50,050
So you say operating.

1175
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,820
The refrigerator is operating.

1176
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:54,760
But I want to do
in-zooming and understand,

1177
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,740
how is it operating?

1178
00:54:56,739 --> 00:55:00,069
So what's the key
to refrigeration?

1179
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:03,182
What's the magic word
there, or two magic words?

1180
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:07,231
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1181
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:08,940
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah,
that's part of it.

1182
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,720
That's just a sliver of it.

1183
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:13,219
Heat exchange is part of it.

1184
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:17,569
So the magic word
is Carnot cycle.

1185
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,690
So here's a little graphic
that sort of gets into it.

1186
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:25,490
So the Carnot cycle is actually
a thermodynamic concept

1187
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:30,219
where you're compressing
essentially a refrigerant.

1188
00:55:30,219 --> 00:55:34,339
A coolant is being
compressed, absorbs the heat

1189
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:39,470
from the inside and then expands
and condenses and radiates that

1190
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,409
or convects that
heat to the outside.

1191
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,295
So here's a--

1192
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,710
I don't know if you remember
your thermodynamics.

1193
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,230
This is a classic PV diagram.

1194
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:50,780
You've got the four legs
of the Carnot cycle.

1195
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,730
And actually, what's
really nice here--

1196
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:55,340
so we're going through
this counter-clockwise.

1197
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:59,059
What's really nice about it is
that every leg of the Carnot

1198
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:01,969
cycle is one of our processes.

1199
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:07,039
So compressing is this leg
here from D to B. Condensing

1200
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:10,009
is from B to A.
Expanding from A to E.

1201
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,740
And then evaporation
happens from E to D.

1202
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:17,929
So the Carnot cycle
can be decomposed

1203
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:20,629
into four subprocesses.

1204
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,869
These are the internal
processes in the system

1205
00:56:23,869 --> 00:56:26,279
that are governed by physics.

1206
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:29,120
So if we take that
operating process

1207
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,369
that we looked at
before, we can actually

1208
00:56:31,369 --> 00:56:35,460
zoom in and see the
subprocesses emerging.

1209
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,720
And so in cooling we have
those four expanding,

1210
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:40,909
evaporating,
compressing, condensing.

1211
00:56:40,909 --> 00:56:42,885
But I'm adding the
absorbing process,

1212
00:56:42,885 --> 00:56:44,509
which is that the
heat then needs to be

1213
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,360
absorbed by the exterior air.

1214
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,769
We have to power the device.

1215
00:56:48,769 --> 00:56:51,079
You can decompose
that into grounding,

1216
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,849
protecting, supplying.

1217
00:56:52,849 --> 00:56:55,819
Regulation, keeping
it at the set point,

1218
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,750
you can decompose that process
into sensing, switching,

1219
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:02,030
and setting the set point.

1220
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,470
And then we have
supporting, which

1221
00:57:03,469 --> 00:57:06,949
is we need to be opening and
closing the refrigerator,

1222
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:09,489
retaining it, and then
connecting all the pieces.

1223
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:14,119
So at Level -1, we had
one process at Level 0,

1224
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:15,469
which was operating.

1225
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,629
The refrigerator was operating.

1226
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:20,105
And then as we
zoom into Level -1,

1227
00:57:20,105 --> 00:57:23,449
four processes appear,
powering, regulating, cooling,

1228
00:57:23,449 --> 00:57:24,559
and supporting.

1229
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:28,849
And then at Level -2,
we have 15 subprocesses.

1230
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:33,699
So this is sort of
a view at Level -1,

1231
00:57:33,699 --> 00:57:37,159
our four subprocesses,
cooling, powering, regulating,

1232
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:38,210
supporting.

1233
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:40,880
And then we can zoom in more.

1234
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,869
So here's the general idea, and
we've looked at many systems

1235
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:48,500
over the years, that most
cyber-physical systems--

1236
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,679
or it says optomechanical
here, but I really

1237
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,669
mean it more generally-- have
this kind of OPM structure.

1238
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:58,130
On the right side,
we have the output

1239
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:00,289
that the customer,
the stakeholder cares

1240
00:58:00,289 --> 00:58:02,159
about, the operand.

1241
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,889
We have a set of
specialized processes,

1242
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:07,609
and these can be often
organized in a cascade.

1243
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,230
And then we have
supporting processes,

1244
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:11,869
like powering,
connecting, controlling,

1245
00:58:11,869 --> 00:58:15,920
that provide support for
the specialized processes.

1246
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:22,920
Most systems that we've seen
have this generic architecture.

1247
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,740
How do you generate an OPM?

1248
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:27,049
Fundamentally, you
can do a top-down.

1249
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,280
So you start with
your stakeholders.

1250
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,610
That's what we did
in the first lecture.

1251
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,980
Where's the value?

1252
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,780
You start thinking
about requirements,

1253
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:40,050
what functions, how well the
functions should be performed.

1254
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,570
And you sort of go down.

1255
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,519
Or if you already
have a system, you

1256
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,009
can actually reverse
engineer that system

1257
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,370
and from bottom
up, like we started

1258
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:52,159
doing for the Mr. Sticky,
and that's fundamentally

1259
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,889
reverse engineering.

1260
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:59,359
So just for time, I'm
going to skip this demo.

1261
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,610
But what I will do is
I will post a video.

1262
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:04,490
I'm going to make a little
video with the OPCAT demo

1263
00:59:04,489 --> 00:59:07,969
and post that to Stellar so
you can sort of watch that.

1264
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:11,689
So this is one of the--
it's still not super mature,

1265
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,639
but it's a Java-based
program called

1266
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:18,889
OPCAT that allows you to
generate object process

1267
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:23,179
diagrams in a
computer-supported environment

1268
00:59:23,179 --> 00:59:27,079
and store them in an XML
format, and so forth.

1269
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:29,029
It allows you to
create a hierarchy.

1270
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:32,880
And the other thing that's very
cool, it autogenerates text.

1271
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,710
So the text is called OPL,
Object Process Language.

1272
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,139
And right now you can go from
the graphics to the text,

1273
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:42,289
but you can't go the other way.

1274
00:59:42,289 --> 00:59:44,239
So they're complete sentences.

1275
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,149
It's not like an exciting
novel when you read it.

1276
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,430
But it is semantically precise.

1277
00:59:50,429 --> 00:59:53,940
So we're going to
switch to SysML.

1278
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:55,769
We're going to take
a very short break.

1279
00:59:55,769 --> 00:59:57,849
Are there any
questions about OPM?

1280
00:59:57,849 --> 00:59:59,610
In the system
architecture class,

1281
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,970
we spend like five,
six lectures on OPM

1282
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:05,279
and you get to do
detailed exercises.

1283
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,750
We kind of don't have time
for this in this class.

1284
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,119
But hopefully you've
seen what it is.

1285
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:13,380
And if I've whetted
your appetite for OPM,

1286
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,190
then the goal has been met.

1287
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,853
Any questions about OPM?

1288
01:00:17,853 --> 01:00:21,030


1289
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,769
Is it pretty clear?

1290
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:23,269
All right.

1291
01:00:23,269 --> 01:00:26,159
So let's take-- yes.

1292
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,519
AUDIENCE: Compared to
Modelica, because I've

1293
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:31,800
seen one of the
links that OPM is

1294
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,680
just for describing
the system, though.

1295
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,199
It's not for making
calculations or simulations.

1296
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,879
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's correct.

1297
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,710
The latest versions
of OPM you can

1298
01:00:40,710 --> 01:00:42,760
do like a logical simulation.

1299
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:46,170
So you can say, OK, this process
enables and does this state,

1300
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:48,000
so it's kind of a
discrete logical.

1301
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:53,070
But usually it's not used for
any mathematical calculations.

1302
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,760
The purpose of OPM is really
to support conceptual design,

1303
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,020
early conceptual design.

1304
01:00:58,019 --> 01:00:59,005
That's correct.

1305
01:00:59,005 --> 01:01:03,259


1306
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,130
Mark.

1307
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,590
So just a couple of
words about Mark.

1308
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,829
He's a doctoral student right
now in the Space Systems Lab.

1309
01:01:10,829 --> 01:01:15,299
He's been working a lot on
an instrument called REXIS.

1310
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,600
I guess you're the chief
system engineer for REXIS.

1311
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:18,599
MARK CHODAS: Yeah, yeah.

1312
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:20,190
OLIVIER DE WECK: And
that was also the topic

1313
01:01:20,190 --> 01:01:21,300
of his master's thesis.

1314
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,940
So Mark really knows
what he's talking about.

1315
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,250
He knows SysML quite well.

1316
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,286
And thanks for doing this.

1317
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:30,869
MARK CHODAS: So let
me start by giving

1318
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:33,269
kind of a high-level
overview of what SysML is

1319
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:34,409
and what it aims to do.

1320
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:37,170
So it's similar to OPM,
but there are a couple

1321
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,079
important differences.

1322
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:42,360
SysML, as Olly said, it
kind of is an extension

1323
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,625
or inherits a lot from UML.

1324
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:48,510
And its aim is to really
provide a language that

1325
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,760
enables you to capture
all the different aspects

1326
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,270
of information about
a system in one place.

1327
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:56,146
And this concept
of Single Source

1328
01:01:56,146 --> 01:01:58,519
Of Truth is something that
I'll kind of try and emphasize

1329
01:01:58,519 --> 01:01:59,670
during my presentation.

1330
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:01,710
The idea is if all
your information

1331
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:05,769
is in this one model, then
communication is easy.

1332
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:08,675
There's no ambiguity
between versions.

1333
01:02:08,675 --> 01:02:10,050
Everyone knows
where to go to get

1334
01:02:10,050 --> 01:02:13,150
the most up-to-date and
correct piece of information.

1335
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:17,139
So that's one of the
emphases of SysML.

1336
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:20,460
SysML is a graphical
language, similar to OPM.

1337
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,260
It's defined in terms
of diagram types

1338
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,550
that I'll go into in a second.

1339
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:25,380
It has more than just
one diagram type,

1340
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,000
as compared to OPM.

1341
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,469
But basically it
aims to do things

1342
01:02:28,469 --> 01:02:31,169
like capture functional
behavioral models,

1343
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:34,144
capture performance models,
capture the structural topology

1344
01:02:34,143 --> 01:02:35,809
of your system, the
parts of your system

1345
01:02:35,809 --> 01:02:37,690
and how they're
all interconnected,

1346
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,450
and any other engineering
analysis model

1347
01:02:39,449 --> 01:02:41,519
is one of the big
emphases with SysML,

1348
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:44,130
is integration with
external analysis tools.

1349
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,410
So if you have a thermal tool, a
structural tool, an electronics

1350
01:02:48,409 --> 01:02:50,250
tool, or something
like that, integrating

1351
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,559
this informational,
descriptional model

1352
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,549
with that analysis
model and enabling,

1353
01:02:55,550 --> 01:02:58,230
making it easy to
transfer information

1354
01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:00,378
from your description model
to your analysis model,

1355
01:03:00,378 --> 01:03:02,670
do an analysis, and then
incorporate those results back

1356
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:05,670
into your descriptive
model is one of the things

1357
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,360
that SysML really is all about.

1358
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,943
Then another thing,
another difference

1359
01:03:08,943 --> 01:03:11,340
compared to SysML from
OPM is it incorporates

1360
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,967
requirements pretty explicitly.

1361
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:15,300
And that's one of the other
areas that people are really

1362
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,970
interested in is if you have
good modeling of requirements,

1363
01:03:17,969 --> 01:03:20,339
what sort of information can
you glean about your system

1364
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,791
that you couldn't otherwise?

1365
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:26,606
How do I advance the slide?

1366
01:03:26,606 --> 01:03:29,449
Oh, there we go.

1367
01:03:29,449 --> 01:03:32,419
So as I said, SysML is
composed of diagrams.

1368
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:34,099
I'll go into in a
second kind of what

1369
01:03:34,099 --> 01:03:35,789
each diagram, what all
the diagram types are

1370
01:03:35,789 --> 01:03:37,163
and what kind of
their intent is.

1371
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:39,249
But here's kind of a
high-level overview.

1372
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,039
It might be a little
bit difficult to read.

1373
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,623
So at the top you
have a system model.

1374
01:03:42,623 --> 01:03:45,349
You have requirements,
diagrams, behavior, structure

1375
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:46,578
and parametrics.

1376
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:48,120
Within requirements,
there's actually

1377
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,299
a specific requirements
diagram that's

1378
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:52,039
supposed to represent
the relationship

1379
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:53,538
between requirements
in your system.

1380
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:55,060
And I'll show an
example of that.

1381
01:03:55,059 --> 01:03:58,309
In behavior, there are
diagrams to describe

1382
01:03:58,309 --> 01:04:01,309
kind of the activity of your
system, the sequence of events

1383
01:04:01,309 --> 01:04:02,576
that may happen.

1384
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,160
There's a state
machine diagram if you

1385
01:04:04,159 --> 01:04:05,809
want to model your
system as a state

1386
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,949
and transition between those
states, things like that.

1387
01:04:08,949 --> 01:04:11,123
In the structure,
there's diagrams

1388
01:04:11,123 --> 01:04:13,039
that go over the
decomposition of your system.

1389
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:13,873
What is your system?

1390
01:04:13,873 --> 01:04:15,860
And what parts make
up your system?

1391
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:19,700
Both the logical decomposition
and the physical decomposition.

1392
01:04:19,699 --> 01:04:21,230
And then there's topology.

1393
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,021
How are they all connected?

1394
01:04:23,021 --> 01:04:24,980
What are the characteristics
of the interfaces?

1395
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:26,179
Things like that.

1396
01:04:26,179 --> 01:04:28,699
And then parametrics,
which is kind

1397
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:32,659
of adding constraints and
numbers to all these things,

1398
01:04:32,659 --> 01:04:34,159
whether they be
logical constraints,

1399
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:36,139
mathematical constraints,
things like that.

1400
01:04:36,139 --> 01:04:39,980
Similar to OPM, SysML has no
built-in analysis capabilities,

1401
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:45,389
so you can't like run a model or
calculate an equation in SysML.

1402
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:46,430
You can't really do that.

1403
01:04:46,429 --> 01:04:53,469
But very frequently the
tools that implement system

1404
01:04:53,469 --> 01:04:55,319
that I'll show
you have that kind

1405
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,380
of analysis capability
built into the tools,

1406
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:58,630
as opposed to the language.

1407
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:03,269
So you can do things like use a
parametric diagram with a bunch

1408
01:05:03,269 --> 01:05:05,759
of equations to create
a system of equations

1409
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,066
that you then can solve,
whether it be in the tool,

1410
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,689
or you can move it
to an external tool,

1411
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,856
like Mathematica or something
and solve it, and then

1412
01:05:11,856 --> 01:05:14,910
bring that information
back into your system.

1413
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:19,920
You also can do kind of
sequence-based computation.

1414
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,956
If you have an activity
diagram that says first you

1415
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:24,539
have to build this
part of your system

1416
01:05:24,539 --> 01:05:25,590
and then this part
of your system,

1417
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:27,630
there's things in sequence,
things in parallel.

1418
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:30,840
You can run simulations like
that where it's all about,

1419
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,370
have you done
everything you need

1420
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:34,170
to do to get to the next step?

1421
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,510
Things in a more logical
flow, as opposed to actually

1422
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:38,760
mathematical equations, you can
do those sorts of computations

1423
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,260
as well.

1424
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,830


1425
01:05:41,829 --> 01:05:45,039
One note is that these diagrams,
although they are the main way

1426
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:48,130
to define your system and
interface with the model,

1427
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,990
are not the model themselves.

1428
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:53,079
So you can create
links between diagrams.

1429
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:56,110
If an element shows up in
one diagram and that element

1430
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:59,362
shows up in another diagram,
that's the same element.

1431
01:05:59,362 --> 01:06:00,820
If you make changes
in one diagram,

1432
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,740
that's going to propagate
to all your diagrams.

1433
01:06:02,739 --> 01:06:04,280
So there's kind of
a database backend

1434
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,956
to this whole model
that encompasses

1435
01:06:06,956 --> 01:06:07,789
all the information.

1436
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:10,279
So instead of having a bunch
of isolated block diagrams,

1437
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,730
they're really just views
into this model that's

1438
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,920
hidden in a backend database.

1439
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:20,480


1440
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,353
So we'll talk a little bit
about the applications of SysML.

1441
01:06:23,353 --> 01:06:24,769
First is requirements
engineering.

1442
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:27,159
As I said, when you can
explicitly model requirements

1443
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:29,539
in the relationship between
requirements and your system,

1444
01:06:29,539 --> 01:06:31,279
you can do a lot more.

1445
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:32,990
The way that it's
typically done nowadays

1446
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,317
is with tons of documents--

1447
01:06:34,317 --> 01:06:36,650
I'm not sure if you've ever
actually developed a system,

1448
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,200
but there's an ungodly
amount of documents.

1449
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:41,179
I've experienced that firsthand.

1450
01:06:41,179 --> 01:06:42,208
It's a real pain.

1451
01:06:42,208 --> 01:06:44,000
There are tools like
DOORS that will enable

1452
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,010
you to link requirements
to other requirements,

1453
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:48,540
and things like that that help
you manage your requirements.

1454
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,289
But what if you had
a really explicit tie

1455
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:52,039
between your requirements
and your system?

1456
01:06:52,039 --> 01:06:53,420
You can actually
represent in SysML.

1457
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,170
And I'll show you a
little bit about this.

1458
01:06:55,170 --> 01:06:57,860
You can represent in SysML a
textural requirement, you know,

1459
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,559
the mass of your system must
be less than 5 kilograms,

1460
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:01,579
or something like that.

1461
01:07:01,579 --> 01:07:03,121
You can tie that
requirement directly

1462
01:07:03,121 --> 01:07:04,789
to the mass property
of your system.

1463
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:05,659
You can [INAUDIBLE].

1464
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:08,058
You can start
building constraints.

1465
01:07:08,059 --> 01:07:10,100
Your requirements aren't
just textual statements,

1466
01:07:10,099 --> 01:07:12,210
they're actually constraints
upon properties of your system.

1467
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,840
Those are the types of things
you can start to do with SysML.

1468
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,298
Do you have a question?

1469
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:25,689
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1470
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:26,440
MARK CHODAS: Yeah.

1471
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,981
Yeah, so that isn't something
that's built into the language.

1472
01:07:28,981 --> 01:07:31,030
But that is something
you can do with--

1473
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,809
basically there's a whole API.

1474
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:35,350
And you can interface
with the model.

1475
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,150
I'll show you this,
actually, in my demo.

1476
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,889
But you can build in rules and
constraints that say, check,

1477
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:42,239
for example, that all my
requirements, at least how

1478
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:43,839
they've been defined,
are satisfied.

1479
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,829
You can run that
check, and it will

1480
01:07:44,829 --> 01:07:46,509
tell you have they
been satisfied or not.

1481
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,301
And that's something
that's really powerful

1482
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,059
that you can't really do with
existing kind of techniques.

1483
01:07:51,059 --> 01:07:51,559
Yeah.

1484
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:53,184
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1485
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:58,170
And can you also, for
example, requirement changes,

1486
01:07:58,170 --> 01:08:00,460
like the master system
has to be this much,

1487
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:03,369
as opposed to this much, then
would it go through and check

1488
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:06,400
until you have to now look
at this, this, and this,

1489
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:07,910
and then that affect like-

1490
01:08:07,909 --> 01:08:10,299
MARK CHODAS: So you're
getting down in the weeds.

1491
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,362
That's something that would
be awesome if you could do.

1492
01:08:13,362 --> 01:08:15,070
That really-- again,
that's not something

1493
01:08:15,070 --> 01:08:17,260
that SysML enables
you to do natively.

1494
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,479
But it gives you the
language and the syntax

1495
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:21,499
to be able to write
queries that give you

1496
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:22,539
that type of information.

1497
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:24,859
That's kind of where the
cutting edge is right now is,

1498
01:08:24,859 --> 01:08:25,569
can we do that?

1499
01:08:25,569 --> 01:08:28,240
Can we get that type of
information from a SysML model?

1500
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,978
That's something I'm really
interested in for my PhD

1501
01:08:29,979 --> 01:08:30,399
thesis.

1502
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:31,981
So yeah, that's
something that I think

1503
01:08:31,981 --> 01:08:34,086
is possible and would
be really great to have

1504
01:08:34,086 --> 01:08:35,710
in the development
process of a system.

1505
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,664


1506
01:08:38,664 --> 01:08:40,789
So the next bullet here is
on a system description.

1507
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:43,010
So actually one of the
fundamental questions

1508
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:46,069
is, how do you describe
a domain-specific system

1509
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:47,240
within SysML?

1510
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:50,000
I'll show you that SysML
has a pretty strong notion

1511
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,920
of inheritance, and
classes, and things like.

1512
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,579
It's object-oriented.

1513
01:08:53,579 --> 01:08:55,670
And so one of the questions is--

1514
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,689
I'm in the space system.

1515
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:59,329
So how do you describe
a spacecraft in SysML?

1516
01:08:59,329 --> 01:09:00,409
SysML is very general.

1517
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:02,460
But how do you
actually represent,

1518
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:04,909
for example, a CNDH
system in SysML?

1519
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:09,680
What are the types of attributes
that are typically found?

1520
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,180
How do you represent that?

1521
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,859
How does it interface with
other parts of your system?

1522
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:13,858
Those type of questions.

1523
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:15,800
That's another active
area of research,

1524
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,449
domain-specific modeling.

1525
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:19,909
And then finally, as
I said, integration

1526
01:09:19,909 --> 01:09:21,126
with external analysis tools.

1527
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:23,210
So there's quite a lot of
papers in the literature

1528
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:26,930
about going from a
SysML model to MATLAB

1529
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:32,680
to SDK to Thermal Desktop,
external modeling tools,

1530
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,180
taking that information out of
the model, doing an analysis,

1531
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:36,939
putting it back in the model.

1532
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:38,960
And actually, I
think there I was

1533
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:42,619
going to talk about Simscape,
which is a kind of analysis

1534
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:43,949
tool, external analysis tool.

1535
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:45,269
And there's actually
been papers written on,

1536
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:47,620
how do you take SysML
information from a SysML model,

1537
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:49,210
pull it into
Simscape process it,

1538
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:50,890
and put it back in the model?

1539
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:54,360


1540
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:56,679
So let's talk
about the diagrams.

1541
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,010
There are nine types
of diagrams in SysML.

1542
01:09:59,010 --> 01:10:01,173
And I'll try and just give
you a brief explanation

1543
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:01,840
of what they do.

1544
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,369
I won't go into the
syntax for all of them

1545
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:05,536
because there's quite a bit
of detail in the syntax.

1546
01:10:05,536 --> 01:10:07,969
But I'll show you some
examples of a couple of them.

1547
01:10:07,969 --> 01:10:09,260
So we'll go from left to right.

1548
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,409
So there's two main classes,
behavior and structure,

1549
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:14,050
similar to OPM.

1550
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:17,619
In the behavior diagram, in
the behavior diagram category

1551
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:19,899
you have activity
diagrams, which basically

1552
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,609
represent flows of activities.

1553
01:10:21,609 --> 01:10:24,849
So you do this, then you
do this, then you do this.

1554
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,890
Those can be tied
to system elements.

1555
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,829
If this system element has this
sort of function or property

1556
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:32,710
or performs this operation on
another part of the system,

1557
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,050
you can represent
that link as well.

1558
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:39,680
There's a sequence diagram,
which is more about logical

1559
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:40,180
ordering.

1560
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,731
So if you have, for example, a
multi-threaded software system,

1561
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:45,189
and you have
different threads that

1562
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:48,261
may need different other
threads to communicate with them

1563
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:50,469
or finish their computation
before that, that way you

1564
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:51,850
can execute things
like that, you

1565
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:56,829
can do that sort of interfacing
between different threads

1566
01:10:56,829 --> 01:10:59,680
of activities in a
sequence diagram.

1567
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,070
This is one of the diagram
types that was kind of inherited

1568
01:11:03,069 --> 01:11:03,949
directly from UML.

1569
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:05,739
So there is a very
kind of strong software

1570
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:06,989
element to that diagram.

1571
01:11:06,989 --> 01:11:11,399


1572
01:11:11,399 --> 01:11:13,071
There's a state machine diagram.

1573
01:11:13,072 --> 01:11:15,029
So obviously, state
machines are very powerful.

1574
01:11:15,029 --> 01:11:16,409
If your system has
various states,

1575
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:18,029
if things in your system
have various states,

1576
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:20,159
you can represent that in
a state machine diagram

1577
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,829
and then talk about, what are
the criteria for transitioning

1578
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:23,489
between states?

1579
01:11:23,489 --> 01:11:26,550
What would trigger or cause
a transition between states?

1580
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,724
What are guards that
must be met before you

1581
01:11:28,724 --> 01:11:29,640
can transition states?

1582
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:30,347
Things like that.

1583
01:11:30,347 --> 01:11:32,850
That's where you represent
the state machine diagram.

1584
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:36,000
These type of diagrams are very
powerful for describing things

1585
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,220
like concept of operations.

1586
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:39,900
So there has been some work--

1587
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:42,389
I did an internship at JPL
a couple of summers ago.

1588
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,670
And they were trying to
build up this capability

1589
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,980
to model a concept of
operations for a spacecraft.

1590
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:50,095
So what are all the power
modes of everything?

1591
01:11:50,095 --> 01:11:51,719
What are the time--
you know, it spends

1592
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,344
this amount of time
in this power mode,

1593
01:11:53,344 --> 01:11:54,899
then it transitions here.

1594
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,940
For example, I can give
an orbit of a spacecraft.

1595
01:11:56,939 --> 01:11:58,314
That's sort of
the thing that you

1596
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,199
can do with this set
of behavior diagrams.

1597
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,340
And then use case analysis.

1598
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,770
Again, it's mostly focused
on early concept development,

1599
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:05,527
stakeholders.

1600
01:12:05,527 --> 01:12:07,109
How do they interface
with the system?

1601
01:12:07,109 --> 01:12:08,789
Where do they derive value?

1602
01:12:08,789 --> 01:12:11,002
How does the user
interact with the system?

1603
01:12:11,002 --> 01:12:11,710
Things like that.

1604
01:12:11,710 --> 01:12:14,609
That's where you put
a use case diagram.

1605
01:12:14,609 --> 01:12:18,009
Going over to structure,
the block definition diagram

1606
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:21,070
is where you define the
structure of your system.

1607
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:23,250
So the logical or
physical decomposition,

1608
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:24,713
I'll show you an
example of this.

1609
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:26,130
So if your system
is a spacecraft,

1610
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:28,350
it has various
subsystems, if you

1611
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:30,600
want to decompose it logically
as a thermal subsystem,

1612
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,211
a structure subsystem,
ADCS subsystem,

1613
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:35,460
things like that, you can
also decompose it physically

1614
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:38,590
so your spacecraft has solar
arrays, it has instruments,

1615
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:40,119
it has thrusters,
things like that.

1616
01:12:40,118 --> 01:12:42,659
You can represent those types
of things in a block definition

1617
01:12:42,659 --> 01:12:43,519
diagram.

1618
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,940
And then internal
block diagram is

1619
01:12:44,939 --> 01:12:47,397
where you describe the ties
with the interfaces between all

1620
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:48,869
the components of your system.

1621
01:12:48,869 --> 01:12:50,661
And this can be at
varying different levels

1622
01:12:50,661 --> 01:12:53,340
of abstraction,
as I'll show you.

1623
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:55,710
Parametric diagram is
kind of a subdiagram type

1624
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,060
of the internal block diagram.

1625
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,620
So you can, again,
put constraints,

1626
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:01,260
mathematical, logical, things
like that, on your interfaces

1627
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,650
and begin to build up the
infrastructure for doing

1628
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,420
computation in the model.

1629
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,989
And then a packaging diagram
is not terribly important.

1630
01:13:09,989 --> 01:13:12,239
It's really focused on the
organization of your model.

1631
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,239
How do you scope things?

1632
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:15,779
It's kind of a modeling
diagram as opposed

1633
01:13:15,779 --> 01:13:17,434
to a representation
of your system.

1634
01:13:17,434 --> 01:13:19,600
Then last of all is the
requirements diagram up top.

1635
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,150
So again, I'll show you
a good example of this.

1636
01:13:21,149 --> 01:13:23,524
But that's where you represent,
how are your requirements

1637
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,170
related to your system?

1638
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:27,100
And then you can see
here what's been modified

1639
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,000
and what's been taken from
UML and the new diagram types

1640
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,020
of requirement and parametric.

1641
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:33,520
There were a couple
of diagram types

1642
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,936
that were eliminated
from UML that

1643
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,599
were pretty software-specific.

1644
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,120
I think there is one called the
deployment diagram, like how

1645
01:13:40,119 --> 01:13:43,119
has your software been
deployed across various servers

1646
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:43,622
or users?

1647
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:44,329
Things like that.

1648
01:13:44,329 --> 01:13:47,229
That's not really-- that's a
pretty software-specific thing,

1649
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:48,799
so in a general
system you might not

1650
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,050
care about that all that much.

1651
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:53,270
So that diagram was removed.

1652
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:56,580
So let me quickly go
over some of the syntax.

1653
01:13:56,579 --> 01:13:59,109
So this is an Interface
Block Diagram, an IBD.

1654
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:00,710
And this is the type
of diagram that I

1655
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:06,270
find is really interesting
representing these interfaces.

1656
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:08,120
So here's the system
engineering ontology

1657
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:09,140
we typically talk about.

1658
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,200
So this is basically a
model of an avionics board.

1659
01:14:12,199 --> 01:14:14,869
So you have things like
voltage converters.

1660
01:14:14,869 --> 01:14:17,229
You have memory,
volatile, nonvolatile.

1661
01:14:17,229 --> 01:14:21,429
We have an FPGA, which is
our main computational unit.

1662
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,079
We talk about these as being
parts of a system in terms

1663
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:25,430
of system engineering ontology.

1664
01:14:25,430 --> 01:14:28,930
Then these are these interfaces
or these lines right here.

1665
01:14:28,930 --> 01:14:31,600
So in SysML, the way we
talk about it is these

1666
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,539
are part properties
of the system.

1667
01:14:35,539 --> 01:14:38,269
It's kind of like an
instantiation type of thing.

1668
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,730
What we're saying is all of
these parts can represent

1669
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:42,269
independent of each other.

1670
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:44,840
And then you define a
property of that part

1671
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,850
as being part of
a different part,

1672
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:48,930
if that makes any sense at all.

1673
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:50,550
So for example, this is a board.

1674
01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:53,150
This main electronics
board is this whole block.

1675
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:55,579
And then that has some
blocks within this block,

1676
01:14:55,579 --> 01:14:57,869
which represent the subparts
that make up the board.

1677
01:14:57,869 --> 01:14:59,630
And these are called
part properties

1678
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,775
of this overall block.

1679
01:15:02,774 --> 01:15:05,149
We have these green little
boxes, which are called ports.

1680
01:15:05,149 --> 01:15:06,732
And again, that's
to support this kind

1681
01:15:06,733 --> 01:15:08,960
of system-independent modeling.

1682
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:11,480
So you can model like a
voltage converter independent

1683
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:14,149
of any type of system
as maybe an input

1684
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:15,289
voltage and output voltage.

1685
01:15:15,289 --> 01:15:17,581
You can define what ranges
those are, things like that.

1686
01:15:17,581 --> 01:15:20,000
And you can model those
interfaces using ports.

1687
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,630
And then these connectors, which
are called connectors in SysML

1688
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:25,850
which represent the
interfaces, represent

1689
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:28,490
how each part is tied into
the kind of larger system.

1690
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:30,349
And you could, for
example, check that you

1691
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:31,820
don't have any empty ports.

1692
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:34,340
If a part needs
an input voltage,

1693
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,380
you could run a
script that checks

1694
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:39,800
that all the parts have all
their ports kind of satisfied.

1695
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,449
That's something you
can do with SysML.

1696
01:15:41,449 --> 01:15:44,020


1697
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,519
So before I get
into the case study,

1698
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,980
I want to talk a little bit
about what you're going to see.

1699
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:49,937
As Olly said, I work on
something called REXIS,

1700
01:15:49,938 --> 01:15:52,239
which is the REgolith
X-Ray Imaging Spectrometer.

1701
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,920
It's an x-ray
spectrometer that's

1702
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:57,369
flying on NASA's OSIRIS-REx
asteroid sample return mission.

1703
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:59,289
I've been working
on it since 2011,

1704
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:02,180
when I was a senior here
all throughout my master's,

1705
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,725
and then now for my PhD.

1706
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,350
Basically we're going
to measure x-rays

1707
01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:07,599
that are fluoresced from the
asteroid surface in order

1708
01:16:07,599 --> 01:16:10,659
to tell what the elemental
composition of the asteroid is.

1709
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:12,615
So that's our main science goal.

1710
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:13,989
And that will
basically enable us

1711
01:16:13,989 --> 01:16:17,171
to categorize where
the asteroid is

1712
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:18,879
within the different
meteorite types that

1713
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,520
have been defined on the ground
based upon existing meteorite

1714
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,350
samples.

1715
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:25,740
So what I did for
my master's thesis

1716
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:28,409
was modeled the design
history of REXIS.

1717
01:16:28,409 --> 01:16:31,859
So how has our design evolved
from the very beginning

1718
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:35,460
where it was very open
ended, very abstract,

1719
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:38,340
and you'll see this,
to the current design,

1720
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,300
which current in this case
was CDR which was over a year

1721
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:44,280
ago now.

1722
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,779
Right now the current
state of REXIS

1723
01:16:45,779 --> 01:16:48,130
is we're almost ready to
mount to the spacecraft.

1724
01:16:48,130 --> 01:16:50,670
So it's very exciting.

1725
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:53,115
Just to give you an
idea of a timeline,

1726
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:55,739
this is something I'm sure Olly
will talk about in this course,

1727
01:16:55,739 --> 01:16:58,179
is the flow through the
system development lifecycles.

1728
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,012
So we have a system
requirements review back

1729
01:17:00,012 --> 01:17:02,119
in January of 2012, system--

1730
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:05,729
I think it's definition
review, April 2012,

1731
01:17:05,729 --> 01:17:08,129
preliminary design
review January of 2013,

1732
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:11,039
and then critical design
review February of 2014.

1733
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,923
So I created models at each of
these design points in SysML

1734
01:17:13,923 --> 01:17:16,340
and looked at, what are the
lessons we could have learned?

1735
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,904
We didn't use the
SysML in REXIS.

1736
01:17:17,904 --> 01:17:19,570
I was kind of looking
back historically,

1737
01:17:19,569 --> 01:17:20,920
what if we had used it?

1738
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:22,619
Could we have designed
our system better

1739
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:25,840
in any sort of way?

1740
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,801
So here is kind of
a CAD representation

1741
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,800
of how a design evolved.

1742
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,600
And I think you can
kind of get the idea.

1743
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,939
Back at SRR, a lot of
things we didn't really

1744
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:34,230
know what they would look like.

1745
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:36,062
We didn't know what the
interfaces would be.

1746
01:17:36,063 --> 01:17:38,340
We didn't know what
all the parts would be.

1747
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,260
We had a little more
development for SDR.

1748
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:42,180
You can see there's more arrows.

1749
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:44,250
The CAD is a little
bit more detailed.

1750
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,860
PDR, we had even more detail.

1751
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:48,609
This was actually like
a buildable design.

1752
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:50,759
This turned out to
not even be buildable.

1753
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,619
And then we had more
evolution between PDR and CDR

1754
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:56,670
to get to pretty much
where the design is.

1755
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,170
There's actually
been some evolution

1756
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:02,298
after this as well, as sometimes
happens with a new system.

1757
01:18:02,298 --> 01:18:03,840
But you can see just
graphically kind

1758
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,730
of the increase in level
of detail and level

1759
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:08,254
of fidelity of the
state of our system

1760
01:18:08,255 --> 01:18:09,630
throughout its
development cycle.

1761
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:12,744
And I'll show you that and how
that looks in the SysML model

1762
01:18:12,744 --> 01:18:14,583
as well.

1763
01:18:14,583 --> 01:18:17,000
So one of the things you can
do if you have a SysML model,

1764
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,819
is as I talked about,
you can run queries on it

1765
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,318
and pull out information that's
very difficult or impossible

1766
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:23,330
to get with our current
deployment practices.

1767
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:26,510
So this is just looking at
the different subassemblies

1768
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,154
within REXIS.

1769
01:18:27,154 --> 01:18:29,570
What are the number of parts
in each of the subassemblies?

1770
01:18:29,569 --> 01:18:31,860
So you can see the general
trend is up for all of them,

1771
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:33,349
as you would expect.

1772
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,510
Some jump up very high.

1773
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:37,694
Some kind of stay
basically where they were.

1774
01:18:37,694 --> 01:18:39,110
But in general,
they all increase.

1775
01:18:39,109 --> 01:18:40,525
And this is something
you might be

1776
01:18:40,525 --> 01:18:42,577
able to do with looking
at like a parts list

1777
01:18:42,577 --> 01:18:44,659
or something like that
with current methodologies.

1778
01:18:44,659 --> 01:18:46,460
But it would be very hard to
get this information, which

1779
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,439
is the number of
ports per assembly.

1780
01:18:48,439 --> 01:18:49,919
So each interface has two ports.

1781
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,795
So these numbers divided
by 2 basically equal

1782
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:54,250
the number of interfaces that
we have in each subassembly.

1783
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:56,207
And you can see, again,
there's a general trend

1784
01:18:56,207 --> 01:18:59,750
of increasing number of ports
as you go through the lifecycle.

1785
01:18:59,750 --> 01:19:01,948
So this is a piece
of information

1786
01:19:01,948 --> 01:19:03,739
you might want to use
if you want to manage

1787
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:04,859
the complexity of your system.

1788
01:19:04,859 --> 01:19:06,659
And you say, this
subassembly is getting--

1789
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,220
it's way too many interfaces,
way too many parts.

1790
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:10,150
It's way too complex.

1791
01:19:10,149 --> 01:19:11,899
We need to think about
how we've logically

1792
01:19:11,899 --> 01:19:13,699
arranged our system
and maybe how can we

1793
01:19:13,699 --> 01:19:15,949
rearrange it to make it more
understandable and easier

1794
01:19:15,949 --> 01:19:16,920
to work with.

1795
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:18,632
And then you can divide the two.

1796
01:19:18,631 --> 01:19:20,339
And you end up looking
at how many-- this

1797
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,020
is ports per part in
each subassembly at each

1798
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:25,370
of the design reviews.

1799
01:19:25,369 --> 01:19:27,739
And you can see trends here,
too, which are interesting.

1800
01:19:27,739 --> 01:19:29,510
So you can see in the
beginning we didn't really

1801
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:30,140
know what we were doing.

1802
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,360
Some of these had a lot
of parts, ports per part.

1803
01:19:32,359 --> 01:19:33,859
Some of these had very few.

1804
01:19:33,859 --> 01:19:35,859
They all ended up
stabilizing kind

1805
01:19:35,859 --> 01:19:38,505
of in between the three and
five ports per part range.

1806
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:40,130
And then you can look
at the literature

1807
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,680
and say, well,
typically systems tend

1808
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,332
to be between five and
six ports per part.

1809
01:19:45,332 --> 01:19:46,289
So what does that mean?

1810
01:19:46,289 --> 01:19:48,742
Does that mean that our system
didn't model it correctly?

1811
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:49,699
That's one possibility.

1812
01:19:49,699 --> 01:19:53,029
It didn't model it to the lowest
level of fidelity possible.

1813
01:19:53,029 --> 01:19:55,551
Does it mean that our
system is too simple?

1814
01:19:55,551 --> 01:19:57,259
Does it mean that
we're missing something

1815
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,579
that we haven't thought about?

1816
01:19:58,579 --> 01:20:00,739
Does it mean that
our system, which

1817
01:20:00,739 --> 01:20:03,109
was intended to be simple
and cheap and implementable

1818
01:20:03,109 --> 01:20:05,329
by students is actually
achieving that goal

1819
01:20:05,329 --> 01:20:07,460
because it's beneath what
you typically expect?

1820
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:09,960
Those are the types of questions
you can ask with this data.

1821
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:12,680
But this data is not easy to get
with the current methodologies.

1822
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,140
So this kind of very
simple queries you can do

1823
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:19,490
gives you power on managing
complexity in your system.

1824
01:20:19,489 --> 01:20:24,340
So let me now transition
quickly to the demo.

1825
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:25,329
Let's see.

1826
01:20:25,329 --> 01:20:45,649


1827
01:20:45,649 --> 01:20:46,514
There's no sound.

1828
01:20:46,515 --> 01:20:48,265
AUDIENCE: I know, but
I need to sync it up

1829
01:20:48,265 --> 01:20:49,450
to make it [INAUDIBLE].

1830
01:20:49,449 --> 01:21:00,729


1831
01:21:00,729 --> 01:21:03,189
OLIVIER DE WECK: So while Mark
is setting up for the demo,

1832
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:06,184
are there any questions
about SysML so far,

1833
01:21:06,185 --> 01:21:07,476
any observations you guys have?

1834
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:11,449


1835
01:21:11,449 --> 01:21:12,859
Maybe at EPFL.

1836
01:21:12,859 --> 01:21:15,139
Do you see the similarities
and differences

1837
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,070
between OPM and SysML?

1838
01:21:16,069 --> 01:21:18,849


1839
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:22,570
What's the biggest
difference between the two?

1840
01:21:22,569 --> 01:21:24,403
There's two really
important differences.

1841
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:27,204


1842
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:28,369
GUEST SPEAKER: No questions?

1843
01:21:28,369 --> 01:21:29,023
Yes.

1844
01:21:29,023 --> 01:21:30,010
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask--

1845
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:30,230
OLIVIER DE WECK: Hang on.

1846
01:21:30,229 --> 01:21:31,029
Hang on.

1847
01:21:31,029 --> 01:21:34,920
Is there anybody at EPFL who
wants to comment on this?

1848
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,569


1849
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:42,576
AUDIENCE: No, there is
no comment from EPFL.

1850
01:21:42,577 --> 01:21:43,409
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

1851
01:21:43,409 --> 01:21:43,909
Good.

1852
01:21:43,909 --> 01:21:45,329
That's fine.

1853
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:46,769
That's fine.

1854
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,016
Mark, are you set up?

1855
01:21:48,015 --> 01:21:48,931
GUEST SPEAKER: Almost.

1856
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:54,077


1857
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:55,659
OLIVIER DE WECK:
What I would say is--

1858
01:21:55,659 --> 01:21:59,889
so first of all, OPM has
only one type of diagram,

1859
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:02,965
and then you go really deep,
sort of a deep hierarchy.

1860
01:22:02,965 --> 01:22:05,880
SysML has nine different
types of diagrams

1861
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,520
split between behavioral
and structural.

1862
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,190
So that's one difference.

1863
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:12,489
And then the other is that
the SysML is fundamentally

1864
01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:16,420
object-oriented because it comes
from object-oriented thinking

1865
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:20,140
and software, whereas OPM
has objects and processes

1866
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,180
sort of at the same level.

1867
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:24,976
Those are two of the most
important differences.

1868
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:27,521


1869
01:22:27,521 --> 01:22:28,479
MARK CHODAS: All right.

1870
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:30,729
So what I'm showing you--
can everyone see the screen?

1871
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:33,159
Just let me know if you
can't see the screen.

1872
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:36,529
What I'm showing you right now
is a tool called MagicDraw.

1873
01:22:36,529 --> 01:22:38,529
There are basically a
variety of tools provided

1874
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:41,439
by commercial vendors that
enable you to build and work

1875
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:42,349
with a SysML model.

1876
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:45,130
So SysML is a language, and
then it's implemented in tools.

1877
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:48,220
And this just happens to be
one that's fairly well, fairly

1878
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:49,900
widely utilized.

1879
01:22:49,899 --> 01:22:51,679
Unfortunately, it's
quite expensive.

1880
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,737
But anyway, so what I'm
showing you right now,

1881
01:22:53,737 --> 01:22:56,319
and this is going to be a little
bit difficult because, as you

1882
01:22:56,319 --> 01:22:59,069
can see, you need a big screen.

1883
01:22:59,069 --> 01:23:01,509
What I'm showing you right
now is a requirements diagram.

1884
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:02,801
So you can see that right here.

1885
01:23:02,801 --> 01:23:04,539
It's a requirements diagram.

1886
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:08,920
And each of these blocks, as
you can see by the tag here,

1887
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,090
is a requirement.

1888
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:12,990
So this is one of our
operating criterias.

1889
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,989
Well operating temperature
of all our components

1890
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:17,380
shall be maintained
within operability limits.

1891
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,210
Straightforward requirement.

1892
01:23:19,210 --> 01:23:21,760
And you can create these
satisfy relationships

1893
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,340
between that requirement
and the components

1894
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,159
in the system that must
satisfy that requirement.

1895
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:30,840
So right now, this is being done
at SRR, as you can see up here.

1896
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,039
So this is very
early in the design.

1897
01:23:34,039 --> 01:23:37,029
So we don't have it broken down
fully to all the components.

1898
01:23:37,029 --> 01:23:39,159
But we have-- here is our
main electronics board.

1899
01:23:39,159 --> 01:23:40,826
It has to satisfy
that requirement.

1900
01:23:40,826 --> 01:23:41,949
Here's our radiation cover.

1901
01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:43,479
It has to satisfy
that requirement.

1902
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:45,549
So you can tie these two
things, the requirement

1903
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:48,091
and the part of the system that
must satisfy the requirement.

1904
01:23:48,091 --> 01:23:50,110
And here I've tied it to parts.

1905
01:23:50,109 --> 01:23:51,849
So these are called
blocks, which

1906
01:23:51,850 --> 01:23:54,545
are the fundamental unit
in SysML, is a block.

1907
01:23:54,545 --> 01:23:56,170
So these represent
parts of our system.

1908
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,127
But you could tie it to
a property of that part

1909
01:23:58,127 --> 01:23:59,143
if you wanted to.

1910
01:23:59,144 --> 01:24:00,560
So then you get
into the situation

1911
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:02,289
I talked about
earlier where you have

1912
01:24:02,289 --> 01:24:05,210
the requirement is on the mass
of it must be less than this.

1913
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:07,210
You can tie it to the
mass of the system itself,

1914
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,251
as opposed to the system.

1915
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:12,850
You can tie it to the actual
property, which is very useful.

1916
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:19,810
So let me quickly show you
one of the cool things.

1917
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,894
If I delete these requirements,
I'm not actually--

1918
01:24:21,894 --> 01:24:23,393
you can see there's
no requirements.

1919
01:24:23,393 --> 01:24:25,800
I'm not actually deleting
them from the system itself,

1920
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:28,610
but I'm just doing it as I'm
removing it from the diagram.

1921
01:24:28,609 --> 01:24:32,159
But if you wanted
to, you should be

1922
01:24:32,159 --> 01:24:39,199
able to look at related elements
of the different blocks.

1923
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,989
So I just clicked
on a block, and I

1924
01:24:40,989 --> 01:24:44,619
can choose to show all the
requirements, all the things

1925
01:24:44,619 --> 01:24:48,279
that are satisfied, the
requirements of that component

1926
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:49,869
of the system satisfies.

1927
01:24:49,869 --> 01:24:53,149
And these requirements pop up.

1928
01:24:53,149 --> 01:24:56,421
So this is showing how
the diagrams themselves

1929
01:24:56,421 --> 01:24:57,129
aren't the model.

1930
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,016
There's actually
backend to the model.

1931
01:24:59,015 --> 01:25:00,639
And you can kind of
work in the diagram

1932
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,960
and show or hide things
however you want.

1933
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,939
But the information is actually
kept behind the diagram,

1934
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:09,119
so to speak.

1935
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:11,970
So my research looked
into typologies.

1936
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:15,300
So let me just kind of show you
a little bit about what I did.

1937
01:25:15,300 --> 01:25:17,610
So this is a block definition
diagram, again, defining

1938
01:25:17,609 --> 01:25:18,659
all the parts of your system.

1939
01:25:18,659 --> 01:25:20,659
And I just want to give
you kind of a high level

1940
01:25:20,659 --> 01:25:24,409
idea of the type of
things that we saw.

1941
01:25:24,409 --> 01:25:32,109
So it's big, first
of all, very big.

1942
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:33,939
These are all the
parts of the system.

1943
01:25:33,939 --> 01:25:35,949
So we start high like
the mission context,

1944
01:25:35,949 --> 01:25:37,573
and the mission
context contains things

1945
01:25:37,573 --> 01:25:40,293
like the environment and the
spacecraft and then REXIS.

1946
01:25:40,293 --> 01:25:41,710
And then you can
break down REXIS.

1947
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:43,819
We have these various
subassemblies broken down

1948
01:25:43,819 --> 01:25:44,679
to parts.

1949
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,020
And that's how you get
this tree structure.

1950
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:50,470
And then this tree structure
can be tied together.

1951
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,780
I can zoom in, but
it's big again.

1952
01:25:52,779 --> 01:25:55,429
So these are all the
parts of our system.

1953
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:58,320
Let me give you an example.

1954
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,409
So we have a couple
of boards that we

1955
01:26:00,409 --> 01:26:02,199
call our detector electronics.

1956
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:05,327
And those detector electronics
have various ports.

1957
01:26:05,327 --> 01:26:07,159
One thing they had to
do, they had this port

1958
01:26:07,159 --> 01:26:10,849
in here and this interface here,
which connects to our CCDs.

1959
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:14,360
So this is showing how you can
build interfaces and SysML.

1960
01:26:14,359 --> 01:26:16,699
So here are the green
boxes, again, or the ports.

1961
01:26:16,699 --> 01:26:18,407
The lines are the
connectors, and they're

1962
01:26:18,408 --> 01:26:19,700
defining all the interfaces.

1963
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:23,659
And you can see at a high
level how complicated things

1964
01:26:23,659 --> 01:26:24,899
get very quickly.

1965
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:28,250
This is the earliest, most
abstract version of our design.

1966
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:30,920
And it already has a
lot of complication.

1967
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:32,739
One thing you can do--

1968
01:26:32,739 --> 01:26:34,375
I talked about running scripts.

1969
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,729
I'll show you how that works.

1970
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:36,859
It's quite easy.

1971
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,079


1972
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:42,000
So I just ran a script
on the model that

1973
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,119
told me to find the number
of parts in the scope

1974
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:47,541
that I defined and
the number of ports.

1975
01:26:47,542 --> 01:26:49,500
And here's the output of
that model right here.

1976
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:53,170
So the script itself is
not even very complicated.

1977
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,940
It's like 50, 60 lines of code.

1978
01:26:55,939 --> 01:26:58,619
And immediately I can pull out
how many ports, how many parts,

1979
01:26:58,619 --> 01:27:01,573
things like that,
information down my system.

1980
01:27:01,573 --> 01:27:03,989
So let me kind of take you
briefly through the development

1981
01:27:03,989 --> 01:27:05,279
process.

1982
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:07,590
So that was, again, the
highest, the most abstract,

1983
01:27:07,590 --> 01:27:09,619
the earliest version
of our system, SRR.

1984
01:27:09,619 --> 01:27:12,000
This is SDR.

1985
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,829
You can see it's starting
to get a bit more complex.

1986
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:20,265
And then you can go
over to PDR, and it

1987
01:27:20,265 --> 01:27:21,690
starts to get really scary.

1988
01:27:21,689 --> 01:27:25,699


1989
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:29,800
And you can go to CDR,
and it's just a nightmare.

1990
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,430
So I created all these systems,
all these models by hand.

1991
01:27:32,430 --> 01:27:34,950
You can actually build
the model with the script,

1992
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,239
if you would like.

1993
01:27:37,239 --> 01:27:39,689
You can basically do things
like define a pattern

1994
01:27:39,689 --> 01:27:42,809
and then apply that pattern
to all the parts of that type.

1995
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:45,180
That's all possible
through the API.

1996
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:48,060
And just to show you how much
of a nightmare it was at CDR,

1997
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:54,470
let me run the same
script on the CDR model.

1998
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:57,617
You have 230 parts
and 900 interfaces.

1999
01:27:57,617 --> 01:27:59,449
And this was not even
modeling to the lowest

2000
01:27:59,449 --> 01:28:00,500
level of fidelity possible.

2001
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:02,498
I didn't, for example,
model all the components,

2002
01:28:02,498 --> 01:28:04,880
all the capacitors,
resistors, op amps, and stuff

2003
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,359
on the board.

2004
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:09,979
And now you can already
see it's quite large.

2005
01:28:09,979 --> 01:28:12,079
Kind of the idea
behind these models

2006
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:15,829
would be to extend this to the
lowest level in a real system

2007
01:28:15,829 --> 01:28:18,260
and use this, basically use
all the capabilities that you

2008
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:19,717
had with the model
to really manage

2009
01:28:19,717 --> 01:28:22,309
your complexity in a way that
is just not possible currently.

2010
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,685
And there's no
way you can really

2011
01:28:23,685 --> 01:28:25,566
mentally keep track of
all these interfaces

2012
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:27,439
and understanding how
your system is working.

2013
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:28,855
So having this
modeling capability

2014
01:28:28,855 --> 01:28:31,699
and querying capability is
really, really powerful.

2015
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:33,019
Yeah?

2016
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:37,350
AUDIENCE: What was used
during REXIS for the systems

2017
01:28:37,350 --> 01:28:38,690
engineering?

2018
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:41,239
You had applied
this after the fact.

2019
01:28:41,239 --> 01:28:46,256
So what was used to create these
block diagram or [INAUDIBLE]..

2020
01:28:46,256 --> 01:28:48,839
MARK CHODAS: Do you mean during
when we were developing REXIS?

2021
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:49,579
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

2022
01:28:49,579 --> 01:28:51,500
MARK CHODAS: We basically
didn't have this.

2023
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,149
So we were relying--

2024
01:28:53,149 --> 01:28:56,059
as you would typically do upon
the capabilities of the system

2025
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,070
engineer or the team--
you'd to have documents.

2026
01:28:58,069 --> 01:29:00,049
We have a ton of documents.

2027
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,360
But I was talking about how
things weren't buildable.

2028
01:29:02,359 --> 01:29:05,264
I found a situation
where because of the way

2029
01:29:05,264 --> 01:29:06,680
we had done our
thermal system, we

2030
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:09,150
were dumping spacecraft
heat to space,

2031
01:29:09,149 --> 01:29:11,210
which you don't want to do.

2032
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,770
I can explain why, but
you don't want to do that.

2033
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:16,329
And that's something we
didn't realize at the time.

2034
01:29:16,328 --> 01:29:17,869
If we had tried to
build it, we would

2035
01:29:17,869 --> 01:29:19,609
have had this
property of the system

2036
01:29:19,609 --> 01:29:21,280
that we didn't know
actually existed

2037
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,029
until I went back and
looked at the model.

2038
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:24,768
So we definitely miss things.

2039
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:26,810
And this should have
improved the design process,

2040
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:29,460
if we had been using it.

2041
01:29:29,460 --> 01:29:32,266
OLIVIER DE WECK: Great, so
Mark, sort of to wrap up,

2042
01:29:32,266 --> 01:29:34,599
because we've got to switch
over to [INAUDIBLE],, what's

2043
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,140
your recommendation for, let's
say, students in the class

2044
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:40,329
got sort of intrigued by SysML.

2045
01:29:40,329 --> 01:29:41,984
What's the next step?

2046
01:29:41,984 --> 01:29:43,859
MARK CHODAS: There's a
couple different ways.

2047
01:29:43,859 --> 01:29:45,317
Certainly if you're
interested, let

2048
01:29:45,318 --> 01:29:47,430
me know, and I can
give you resources

2049
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:49,740
to further your understanding.

2050
01:29:49,739 --> 01:29:51,979
As I said, working
with these tools

2051
01:29:51,979 --> 01:29:53,716
can be expensive
to get these tools.

2052
01:29:53,716 --> 01:29:55,799
So I can help you understand
what that would take.

2053
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:59,250


2054
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:03,060
There are beginning to
be some companies that

2055
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:06,300
will do like SysML training
courses that will sit down

2056
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:08,940
for a day or a week
and teach you SysML,

2057
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:11,543
basically, how to work with the
model, how to build the model.

2058
01:30:11,543 --> 01:30:12,710
I took one of those courses.

2059
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,556
It was really great.

2060
01:30:14,556 --> 01:30:16,139
Yeah, talk to me if
you're interested,

2061
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:18,059
and I can steer you
down the right path.

2062
01:30:18,059 --> 01:30:19,600
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Great, thanks, Mark.

2063
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,350
MARK CHODAS: Sure.

2064
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,400
OLIVIER DE WECK: Very good.

2065
01:30:22,399 --> 01:30:25,439
So we did in 20 minutes what
usually takes about a week,

2066
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:26,886
right?

2067
01:30:26,886 --> 01:30:28,469
MARK CHODAS: There's
a lot more depth.

2068
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:29,550
There's a lot more depth.

2069
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,925
OLIVIER DE WECK: Great, so
we're going to switch over now

2070
01:30:31,925 --> 01:30:35,190
to Modelica, which I think is--

2071
01:30:35,189 --> 01:30:37,979
we're going to maybe run a
couple of minutes over today,

2072
01:30:37,979 --> 01:30:42,279
but I think it's important
we cover all three languages.

2073
01:30:42,279 --> 01:30:45,369
So let's get the slides back up.

2074
01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:47,170
And I'm going to
switch here to Narek.

2075
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:49,779
He's another doctoral
student in the group.

2076
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:56,514
And so introduce yourself and
then tell us about Modelica.

2077
01:30:56,514 --> 01:30:58,699
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: Thank you.

2078
01:30:58,699 --> 01:30:59,304
OLIVIER DE WECK: Are
you using this computer

2079
01:30:59,304 --> 01:31:00,470
for slides or this computer?

2080
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:03,707
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: For the demo,
I'm going to use this one.

2081
01:31:03,707 --> 01:31:04,789
OLIVIER DE WECK: This one?

2082
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:05,283
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: This one.

2083
01:31:05,283 --> 01:31:06,365
OLIVIER DE WECK: This one.

2084
01:31:06,365 --> 01:31:15,054


2085
01:31:15,054 --> 01:31:16,220
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: Thank you.

2086
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:16,980
So hello, everyone.

2087
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:17,687
My name is Narek.

2088
01:31:17,688 --> 01:31:20,720
I'm a doctoral student
at AeroAstro here.

2089
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:22,963
My background is in
gas turbine engines,

2090
01:31:22,963 --> 01:31:24,380
and specifically
I've been looking

2091
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:27,109
at concept generation of gas
turbine engines, automated

2092
01:31:27,109 --> 01:31:28,819
concept generation.

2093
01:31:28,819 --> 01:31:31,369
And the way I got
acquainted with Modelica

2094
01:31:31,369 --> 01:31:34,489
was that I needed to be
able to rapidly reconfigure

2095
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:38,119
different concepts and
simulate them mathematically,

2096
01:31:38,119 --> 01:31:39,890
do physics-based simulations.

2097
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:42,440
So in contrast to the
first two languages,

2098
01:31:42,439 --> 01:31:46,099
Modelica is a lot
more about rapidly

2099
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:48,860
being able to build
physical models of systems

2100
01:31:48,859 --> 01:31:51,659
and reconfiguring them and
reusing them for later on.

2101
01:31:51,659 --> 01:31:54,399


2102
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:57,599
So like I mentioned,
Modelica is primarily

2103
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:00,390
about modeling physics-based
modeling of systems

2104
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:04,560
and rapidly being able to reuse
models and reconfigure them.

2105
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:05,789
It's a language, again.

2106
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:09,519
It's not a tool like the first
two that you heard about.

2107
01:32:09,519 --> 01:32:12,060
There are many different tools
which implement this language.

2108
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,069
But I'm going to start
off with just describing

2109
01:32:14,069 --> 01:32:16,110
how the language works
and then go on to describe

2110
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:17,699
which tools that you can use.

2111
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,949
In contrast to SysML,
there are a couple

2112
01:32:19,949 --> 01:32:22,260
of really good free tools
that you can use and rapidly

2113
01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:22,949
get into.

2114
01:32:22,949 --> 01:32:25,439
And there are a lot
of libraries that you

2115
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,449
can use with hundreds,
even thousands,

2116
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:31,019
of actually basic components
that you can use for modeling.

2117
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:32,670
So it's a declarative language.

2118
01:32:32,670 --> 01:32:35,010
And what I mean
by declarative is

2119
01:32:35,010 --> 01:32:38,699
that in sequential
sort of programming,

2120
01:32:38,699 --> 01:32:39,929
you write commands.

2121
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:42,820
And you make assignments
to various parameters.

2122
01:32:42,819 --> 01:32:45,750
Here, you just describe
the governing equations

2123
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:48,689
of the components
you want to simulate.

2124
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,299
And there's no particular
order in which you do this.

2125
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,529
The models are acausal.

2126
01:32:52,529 --> 01:32:54,479
There's no direction to flows.

2127
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:58,469
All you really need to do is
describe what ports, like Mark

2128
01:32:58,470 --> 01:32:59,376
mentioned.

2129
01:32:59,376 --> 01:33:01,500
It's similar in this
situation-- what kind of ports

2130
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,760
you have, what
kind of interfaces

2131
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:04,710
the components can have
with other components,

2132
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:08,159
and the governing equations and
the parameters and variables.

2133
01:33:08,159 --> 01:33:10,106
It's a multi-domain
modeling language,

2134
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:11,939
so it's like agnostic
to what kind of domain

2135
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:12,688
you're working in.

2136
01:33:12,689 --> 01:33:14,640
It's not particular to
electrical engineering.

2137
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,140
For example, I'm
going to be showing

2138
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,820
an electrical
engineering example

2139
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:20,130
and also show a gas
turbine engine example

2140
01:33:20,130 --> 01:33:22,534
with aeroelastic vibrations.

2141
01:33:22,533 --> 01:33:24,449
So you don't necessarily--
you're not attached

2142
01:33:24,449 --> 01:33:26,340
to any specific domain.

2143
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,680
It's also
object-orientated, and it

2144
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:33,390
enables you to decompose
systems into subsystems

2145
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:36,570
or recombine them and look
at them at various levels

2146
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,019
of abstraction.

2147
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,342
It's designed to be efficient.

2148
01:33:40,341 --> 01:33:42,299
So this is a quote from
Professor Peter Fritzen

2149
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,310
at the Linkopings University.

2150
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:47,610
So these are just about
the scale of problems

2151
01:33:47,609 --> 01:33:50,631
that you can solve with
the Modelica language.

2152
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:52,589
Obviously, it depends on
what kind of equations

2153
01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:55,500
you're talking about,
but it's designed

2154
01:33:55,500 --> 01:34:00,539
to be a very efficient
way of simulating systems.

2155
01:34:00,539 --> 01:34:02,609
So I really want to
talk a little bit more

2156
01:34:02,609 --> 01:34:04,949
about this idea of
acausal modeling

2157
01:34:04,949 --> 01:34:06,639
that I mentioned before.

2158
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:09,880
So on the left hand
side is an assignment.

2159
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:13,529
And that's typically what you
do when you program in MATLAB,

2160
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:15,889
just the MATLAB normal scripts.

2161
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:19,380
f is assigned to ma or p is
assigned the value of rho rt

2162
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,159
for the equation
of state of a gas.

2163
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:22,949
And what that means
is that you know

2164
01:34:22,949 --> 01:34:24,779
what the mass and
acceleration are,

2165
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:26,029
and you figure out the force.

2166
01:34:26,029 --> 01:34:28,039
You assign that
value to the force.

2167
01:34:28,039 --> 01:34:30,505
In Modelica, there's
almost none of this.

2168
01:34:30,505 --> 01:34:32,340
It's equations not assignments.

2169
01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:34,470
And what I mean by
that is this equation

2170
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,840
can be written in any which
way, as long as your system

2171
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:39,864
has the same number of
equations as unknowns.

2172
01:34:39,864 --> 01:34:43,229
The tool that you're using
will interpret the language

2173
01:34:43,229 --> 01:34:44,769
and will solve your problem.

2174
01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:46,519
So you can write this
in any which way you

2175
01:34:46,519 --> 01:34:47,670
want in any order.

2176
01:34:47,670 --> 01:34:51,149
As long as your problem
is properly constrained,

2177
01:34:51,149 --> 01:34:53,029
the tool that you're
using will interpret it

2178
01:34:53,029 --> 01:34:54,853
and solve the problem for you.

2179
01:34:54,854 --> 01:34:58,050


2180
01:34:58,050 --> 01:35:04,230
So just to go into a little bit
more detail, all of Modelica's

2181
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:06,809
and also other acausal
modeling language that I'll

2182
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:08,350
mention in a little bit--

2183
01:35:08,350 --> 01:35:11,460
which one of them is Simscape--

2184
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:12,850
have essentially three parts.

2185
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:15,880
They're designed to
be extremely simple.

2186
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:19,810
The first, like Mark
mentioned, are ports.

2187
01:35:19,810 --> 01:35:24,630
It's essentially identical
to SysML in a way.

2188
01:35:24,630 --> 01:35:27,600
Ports are the ways
with which components

2189
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,990
can share information, material,
or energy, for example.

2190
01:35:31,989 --> 01:35:33,751
You can define any
kind of port you want.

2191
01:35:33,752 --> 01:35:36,210
All you need to really do is
define what kind of parameters

2192
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,792
it carries-- like for gas, for
example, temperature, pressure,

2193
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:43,059
and mass flow; or for electrical
ports, voltage and current.

2194
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:45,000
The second part of
any kind of model

2195
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,640
that you're building in
Modelica or Simscape,

2196
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,092
which I'll mention
a little later,

2197
01:35:49,091 --> 01:35:50,299
are variables and parameters.

2198
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:51,270
So you just declare those.

2199
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,061
And the third part are
governing equations.

2200
01:35:53,060 --> 01:35:55,380
The point is that
there's nothing else.

2201
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,890
It's just that.

2202
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:00,350
And I'll just brief briefly
go through a very, very

2203
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:01,640
simple example.

2204
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:04,860
So for example, a capacitor.

2205
01:36:04,859 --> 01:36:06,710
This is the entire
code for a capacitor,

2206
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,579
and this is what will generate
a visual image of a capacitor

2207
01:36:10,579 --> 01:36:13,640
with the correct ports for you.

2208
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:18,050
First you have pins that
carry voltage and current.

2209
01:36:18,050 --> 01:36:21,739
So the key thing to notice here
is that there are fundamentally

2210
01:36:21,739 --> 01:36:25,929
two types of variables-- flow
variables and normal variables

2211
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:26,960
here.

2212
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,899
Flow variables are ones
for which the Kirchoff's

2213
01:36:29,899 --> 01:36:30,779
current law applies.

2214
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:33,619
So mass flow, for
example, every time

2215
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:35,239
you connect 15
components together

2216
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:37,909
in a network, mass
flow into that network

2217
01:36:37,909 --> 01:36:39,239
needs to be conserved.

2218
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:43,010
So the sum of mass flows
into any node has to be zero.

2219
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:46,774
That doesn't apply to
the standard variables.

2220
01:36:46,774 --> 01:36:49,560


2221
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:54,650
So then you essentially define
the parameters, the variables.

2222
01:36:54,649 --> 01:36:57,170
And you need to define
the governing equations.

2223
01:36:57,170 --> 01:36:58,940
And that's the
capacitor for you.

2224
01:36:58,939 --> 01:37:01,039
There are slightly more
complicated components

2225
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:05,449
that you can use, for example
a pressure drop component.

2226
01:37:05,449 --> 01:37:06,760
Did I lose my sharing?

2227
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:08,820
No.

2228
01:37:08,819 --> 01:37:12,170
In this case, the main thing
to take away from this one

2229
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:14,480
is that if you have
complicated mathematics

2230
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:16,939
describing the fluid
mechanics in a component,

2231
01:37:16,939 --> 01:37:19,489
you can actually
initialized with one model

2232
01:37:19,489 --> 01:37:21,889
and then go to a full
turbulent simulation.

2233
01:37:21,890 --> 01:37:25,220
That's what this is doing here.

2234
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:31,449
So just to get to the tool side
of the equation, the language I

2235
01:37:31,449 --> 01:37:33,753
just showed you, it's the
same across all the tools.

2236
01:37:33,753 --> 01:37:35,170
But there are many
different tools

2237
01:37:35,170 --> 01:37:38,710
which you can use free and
commercial to actually run

2238
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:40,720
these models.

2239
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:44,770
The main one that you'll be
using if you want to get deeper

2240
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:46,030
into this is OpenModelica.

2241
01:37:46,029 --> 01:37:47,139
It's free.

2242
01:37:47,140 --> 01:37:50,869
It's actually become
quite user-friendly.

2243
01:37:50,869 --> 01:37:55,649
And there's a link in the slides
from which you can download it.

2244
01:37:55,649 --> 01:37:57,129
There's one from Wolfram.

2245
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:00,203
It's integrated
with Mathematica,

2246
01:38:00,203 --> 01:38:01,119
which is quite useful.

2247
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,039
And there's a free
trial of it as well.

2248
01:38:03,039 --> 01:38:04,069
There's Dymola.

2249
01:38:04,069 --> 01:38:05,859
There are other ones.

2250
01:38:05,859 --> 01:38:07,779
But mainly, I think
OpenModelica is the one

2251
01:38:07,779 --> 01:38:09,543
that you guys will be using.

2252
01:38:09,543 --> 01:38:11,659
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
so in other words,

2253
01:38:11,659 --> 01:38:14,019
I think we're going to
wrap up and then have you

2254
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:14,760
back next week.

2255
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:15,225
NAREK SHOUGARIAN: OK.

2256
01:38:15,225 --> 01:38:15,900
OLIVIER DE WECK: Are
you around next week?

2257
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:17,357
NAREK SHOUGARIAN:
Yeah, yeah. sure.

2258
01:38:17,358 --> 01:38:20,269


2259
01:38:20,269 --> 01:38:21,810
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Just to stay around.

2260
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:27,390
So basically we're going to
finish this lecture next week.

2261
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:30,539
I think it's important enough
that you really see the demo

2262
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:31,670
and see sort of the--

2263
01:38:31,670 --> 01:38:35,250
and it actually ties in kind of
nicely with next week's topic

2264
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:36,840
is concept generation.

2265
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:40,619
This is the next step in the V.
And since Narek, your research

2266
01:38:40,619 --> 01:38:44,470
is also on concept generation,
it'll tie in nicely.

2267
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:47,110
So I think we're going
to stop here for today.

2268
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:50,429
So you heard about the general
idea of system modeling

2269
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:54,150
languages that are rigorous,
that have ontology, syntax

2270
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:55,889
and, semantics.

2271
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:58,829
There's different of these that
have been proposed, developed.

2272
01:38:58,829 --> 01:39:00,699
Some are used more than others.

2273
01:39:00,699 --> 01:39:03,130
There's really important
differences between them.

2274
01:39:03,130 --> 01:39:05,569
So OPM is very conceptual.

2275
01:39:05,569 --> 01:39:09,899
SysML is based on UML and
has these different type

2276
01:39:09,899 --> 01:39:12,960
of diagrams and can
really help you flesh out

2277
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,670
your design in more detail.

2278
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:17,100
And then Modelica allows
you to build these blocks.

2279
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,190
It's acausal or declarative.

2280
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:23,519
And you can actually simulate
the physics of the system

2281
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,920
pretty readily.

2282
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,250
So the big picture here,
just to wrap up here,

2283
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:32,220
the big picture
is the following.

2284
01:39:32,220 --> 01:39:34,750
And we'll come back
to this next week.

2285
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:39,689
The big picture is basically
that system engineering

2286
01:39:39,689 --> 01:39:41,879
is in a transition phase.

2287
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,279
The classic way of doing
system engineering really

2288
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:48,630
for the last 50 years is on
the left, document-centric.

2289
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:50,400
Write your requirements.

2290
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:51,869
Do your drawings.

2291
01:39:51,869 --> 01:39:54,510
Even CAD, you know,
computer-aided design,

2292
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:56,670
is great, but it
only essentially does

2293
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,039
the mechanical
part of the design.

2294
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:02,399
And so the result of that
is as you get-- even REXIS,

2295
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,909
REXIS is a box, like
shoe-box size, basically.

2296
01:40:05,909 --> 01:40:08,909
And it's going to fit on
a much bigger spacecraft.

2297
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:11,039
And you saw how much
complexity is there.

2298
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:14,699
And it gets very, very difficult
to manage all this information,

2299
01:40:14,699 --> 01:40:19,439
to prevent errors, oversights,
any change that you make.

2300
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:21,210
It doesn't propagate
automatically

2301
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:22,920
in these documents.

2302
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:26,359
So the transition is
happening to the right side,

2303
01:40:26,359 --> 01:40:30,420
a model-centric way to
do system engineering.

2304
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:33,090
And think of
paperless engineering.

2305
01:40:33,090 --> 01:40:35,730
Everything you're
doing is in a model.

2306
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,109
The models are linked.

2307
01:40:37,109 --> 01:40:38,939
The models are executable.

2308
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:42,210
The models automatically
propagate any changes

2309
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:44,909
that you make in
requirements or design.

2310
01:40:44,909 --> 01:40:46,409
We're not quite there yet.

2311
01:40:46,409 --> 01:40:48,960
But that is where
things are moving.

2312
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,779
And so keep that in mind.

2313
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,579
So there's no new
assignment this week.

2314
01:40:53,579 --> 01:40:56,987
So next week, we have A-2,
which is do, the requirements.

2315
01:40:56,987 --> 01:40:59,319
Please let us know if you
have any-- we're here for you.

2316
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:02,369
So I'm going to have office
hours now on the WebEx.

2317
01:41:02,369 --> 01:41:03,210
You have the link.

2318
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:05,930


2319
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:07,600
If you have any
questions about A-2,

2320
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,180
don't be shy to email me or
[? Yuanna ?] or [? Leislu ?]

2321
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:13,529
at EPFL.

2322
01:41:13,529 --> 01:41:15,320
We're really here to
answer your questions.

2323
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,479
So next week topic, we're
going to finish on Modelica,

2324
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,419
and concept generation is going
to be sort of our-- creativity

2325
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:26,340
concept generation is
our main topic next week.

2326
01:41:26,340 --> 01:41:37,257
