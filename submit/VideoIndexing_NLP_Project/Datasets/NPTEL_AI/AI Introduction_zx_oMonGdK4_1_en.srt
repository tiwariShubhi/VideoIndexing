1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:22,250
We will begin, so we are entering a last lecture
of our introduction part. And I do not

2
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,480
know whether, you can read the names on the
slides. These are the people we have met

3
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:36,299
so far. Starting with Nicolaus Copernicus
are even before that Ramon Lull. And host

4
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,839
are
people including Galileo and Hobbes and Descartes,

5
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,010
Pascal. Pascal who said that
perception is in our minds. And if is smell,

6
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,229
the smell of a rose, then that is a reaction
to

7
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,129
though partials that are in . upon our nose.
And we are set of

8
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,789
pursuing based on that essentially.

9
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,040
So, we saw that there was a stand of listening.
Now, this is you can say the pre-history of

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,690
AI. And you can see, from this diagram that
it is about more than 500 years of history.

11
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,259
And their two stands to this. And one is said
the physical side of trying to make, talking

12
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,560
heads, walking statues. And statues, which
can you know not their heads and that kind

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,040
of
stuff. The engineering all the physical all

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,090
the contraction site of it. Because, they
was the

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,759
.believes an it can move autonomously. It
must be able to think also essentially.

16
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,188
So, there leap of faith, that one is to make.
The others stand was the emergence of the

17
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:49,938
motion of the mind. At some point you know,
teachers like us for simply live in a world

18
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:56,408
and see the world. And believe that what we
see is what the world is like. But, then along

19
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:02,210
cames somebody like Copernicus. And he said
that, you thing at the sun is going around

20
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:07,319
the earth during the day, but that is not
what is happening. What is happening is at

21
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:09,219
the
earth is rotating. And it creates and elution

22
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:10,949
of the sun going around the earth.

23
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:19,289
So, the fact it what you see is not necessarily
what is out there had already started

24
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:23,750
coming out. And gradually then that the distinction
between what we see and what we

25
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,030
think started happening. And that some point
they cart said there two world out there.

26
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,219
One is the world of a mind. And other is the
world of the body. And he had this idea of

27
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:40,810
mind what is dualism. Then as we moved along
we saw cant for example.

28
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:49,199
Immanuel Kant one of the most influential
philosophers a from Europe, who said that

29
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:55,609
we
perceive the world. In terms of a priory knowledge

30
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,540
that we have in our heads. And we
mold the world at we see into those a priory

31
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:05,329
knowledge structures that we have. Of
course, he did not use the term knowledge

32
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,830
structure, which we used now a days concepts
at we have essentially. And at the same time

33
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:18,140
the mechanical contraptions of becoming
more and more sophisticated. They was just

34
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:20,789
duct in trance or a vacancies.

35
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:25,689
So, some of you saw, BBC every Sunday if you
see BBC you get something for this

36
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:32,039
course. So, this last Sunday, BBC showed a
news item, in which in the south of France.

37
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:37,479
They have open the museum of all these talking,
walking mechanical creatures

38
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,840
essentially, which apparently very popular.
And you should keep them in shop window

39
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,519
to attracts shoppers, then thinks like that.
And I could see there, this vacancies duct

40
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,689
also
amongst the displease. So, they were getting

41
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,689
sophisticated.

42
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:58,239
And we see that from, so these two stands
the merging together. You know this moving

43
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,789
creatures and thinking futures in some sense.
So, Pascal for example, we will so those

44
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:11,769
can recognize him here for the fact that he
was the first person to invent a calculating

45
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,599
machine. Of course, it could only do addition.
But, nevertheless it was a calculating

46
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,129
.machine, which was set of improve later by
lightness into something, which could do

47
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,930
more than addition, it could do multiplication
and so on.

48
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,750
And it became more and more sophisticated,
tell we came to Chales Babbage, who

49
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,899
invented a machine which could store of a
program. And run the instructions in that

50
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:38,250
program, which is the notion of computers,
that we are still working with essentially.

51
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,529
We
also met Alan Turing, who sort of try to put

52
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:47,519
down this debate on, what is intelligence
scan machine things. And that can he propose

53
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,399
a Turing test that we saw earlier. He did
many other things and we will just have a

54
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,649
brief mention on of him later essentially.

55
00:04:55,649 --> 00:05:04,609
So, let me remind you of this definition by
hogiland. AI is the quest for building,

56
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,910
machines with minds of your own. And we are
ask this question, towards the end of the

57
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,620
last lectures. So, what are minds, we will
come to that question later today, but a little

58
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,030
bit
later. Before that with less complete the

59
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:23,779
histories. So, we have seen the pre-digital
computer hire so far, the mechanical contraptions

60
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:30,629
are people use the bill. How they AI
progress after the digital computer came into

61
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:36,209
b, which is just along the time an Alan
during was around.

62
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,209
.

63
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:44,659
So, let us first begin with this piece of
information is tells us, how did he get this

64
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
name

65
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:53,850
.artificial intelligence essentially. And
the name was devise by John McCarthy. I think

66
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,320
you all know John McCarthy for some form of
another. Among other things invent

67
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:09,050
language lisp, which became very popular in
AI for many years. So, the name is credited

68
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:14,660
John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, along with
Claude Shannon. Who organized this

69
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:21,130
conference called the Dartmouth confidence
in Dartmouth college in 1956; where

70
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:24,370
McCarthy is credited with the having devices
name artificially intelligence.

71
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,430
Now, many people have said that, it is name
is not a nice name. You should used

72
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:34,538
something like heuristic programming or machine
intelligence or something else. But,

73
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:39,279
some of the name as stuck since that time.
And we all know this area artificial

74
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,709
intelligence. So, hogiland for example, suggest
that you could call it synthetic

75
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:48,939
intelligence. So, artificially and he makes
with comparison with pearls for example.

76
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:54,478
Now, you have real pearls we have artificial
pearls, which have kind of fake essentially.

77
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,769
But, you also have synthetic pearls, which
have not fake, but which are pearls in sort

78
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:04,180
of
made by humans. So, the conference was organized

79
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:14,040
and it is charter was that if you two
months, ten mans study of artificial intelligence.

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,710
So, name was point there. On the basis
of the conjecture that every aspect of learning

81
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:24,769
was or any other future of intelligence can
in principle be so precisely described. That

82
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:30,339
a machine can we made to simulated. So, the
focus all the emphasis is that when we are

83
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:32,209
talking about intelligent behavior.

84
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:38,728
.It is something, which we can describe up
to the Manutius detail. And if you can do

85
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:41,579
that,
we can make a machine do with essentially.

86
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:47,430
That was the idea behind that. So, who are
the people, who organized this feels see them

87
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,629
in the moment. So, for those of you hand
residing history. So, we should look at this

88
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,959
two books, which I have mention earlier. And
this one book all machines for think, that

89
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,969
is shown here by . which
describes the full chapter on the Dartmouth

90
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,879
conference. And the other book is John
hogiland, which is AI the very idea which

91
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,270
is the most philosophical side of things.
Essentially will come back to that bit later.

92
00:08:10,269 --> 00:08:11,269
.

93
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:18,049
So, who are the organizes of this conference,
we have already said that they were John

94
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:27,129
McCarthy, he was then and assistant professor
at Dartmouth. And he has done many,

95
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:32,610
many, so these people who have contributed
so much to AI in one way or the other that

96
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:40,009
is not easy to list there. What all they are
very active people. McCarthy inventor lisp

97
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:42,379
he
invented something called situational calculus,

98
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:45,629
which we will may or may not see in this
course.

99
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:51,600
He is also credited with having invented the
alpha beta algorithm, which we will see a

100
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,889
bit
later in this course. And he did lot of work

101
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:00,929
on logic commonsense listening essentially,
which will see if you can come to that later.

102
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,669
Marvin Minsky the only person of these

103
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:10,479
.whose still alive was a junior fellow at
Howard he and McCarthy towards set of the

104
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,490
MIT
lab AI lab in MIT. And as you will see in

105
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:20,440
the history parts today most of these work
in A

106
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,200
I was concentrated in a few places in the
US and few places in Europe.

107
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,470
And it is not as a everybody everywhere was
working on AI. So, MIT lab was on CMU

108
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,959
was another place, stand for another place.
And you know a couple of places in Europe

109
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:42,719
essentially. So, Minskye is very well known
for his idea on frames, which is a way of

110
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:51,420
structuring knowledge into interconnected
components. And it is basically, the for 1

111
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,079
hour
for three college object one day programming

112
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,740
nowadays essentially. He also wrote a
very Influential book also society of mind.

113
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,620
And more recently book all the emotion machine
essentially. The somebody have once

114
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,470
pointed out dealing over machine, lectures
that machines cannot display emotions. So,

115
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,980
maybe it should look at that book. Another
person there was what is turn, who was the

116
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:22,060
inventor of release at the designer of this
IBM 701, which was the best machine around

117
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:26,289
the that time, in work the first assembly
of for that machine.

118
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:32,240
He supervised arsis into writing of program
for playing the game of checkers, which you

119
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,409
will talk about little bit, which was one
of the early successive of AI essentially.

120
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:41,129
Now, I
turns out that this Samuels program was a

121
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,799
learning program. And Samuels goals for
actually learning, he wanted to see how computers

122
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:51,159
could learn. And his program was the
program, which became better and better as

123
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,379
it late more and more essentially.

124
00:10:54,379 --> 00:11:03,450
And this kind of a generated, a kind of a
fear amongst a people that is machines will

125
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,720
become smarter than us. More powerful than
us and thinks like that, will come back to

126
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,009
that point little bit later. When we talk
over is checkers program. And finally, Claude

127
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,919
Shannon everybody knows Claude Shannon, because
of is in information to the end

128
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,929
there. He was the person who had hired Minsky
and the McCarthy as in terns when they

129
00:11:22,929 --> 00:11:26,179
were graduate students. And it is they are
that they got this idea of floating together

130
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:29,059
this
conference, which would talk about this new

131
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:34,109
feel which was coming of call artificial
intelligence.

132
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,110
..

133
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,589
But, they was couple of guys, who were in
some senses are shows dealers that

134
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,891
confidence essentially. So, let us first see,
who there were the names we have might have

135
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:53,309
mention before, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell
and . corded says

136
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,400
are they that about them the two vaguely known
persons working at Carnegie Tech. At

137
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,919
that time . university it later on became
CMU.

138
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:08,429
At that point it was Carnegie Tech and grand,
who are also in mighty to the Dartmouth

139
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:15,129
conference . as an afterthought. And it is
these to people, who really

140
00:12:15,129 --> 00:12:20,679
creative then big impact at the conference.
Because, they had along with J. C. Shaw, who

141
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:26,278
also was that rand, build this return this
program call the logic list. It was a logical

142
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,759
listening machine, a theorem proving machine.
It put prove theorems in mathematics. LT

143
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,049
as short it was.

144
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:38,179
So, this say about this, it was a first program
deliberately engineer to mimic the problem

145
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:42,539
solving the skills of a human being essentially.
So, Simon and Newell for greatly

146
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,689
inference by the way human being solve problem.
Because, after all we are sort of

147
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:55,681
existential examples of smart creatures. You
know, we set of are thinking creatures if

148
00:12:55,681 --> 00:13:00,200
you do not want to call us machines, who operate
very effectively in the world. You

149
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,300
know, solving problems and getting along and
so on.

150
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:08,809
.And he wrote a book, they wrote a book call
human problem solving, which became very

151
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:14,649
influential later essentially. Now, this program
logic theories, went on to proves several

152
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:21,909
theorems on from .. See, . had embargoed
upon this land exercise of formalizing all

153
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:26,429
knowledge. And this had you know everything
that you can do mathematics will put it down

154
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:36,049
piece of paper. There great dream or
shattered and 1931 by Kurt Godel, when he

155
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:42,729
came and proved that you cannot become
powerful.

156
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:50,670
You cannot construct powerful enough systems
listening system, which are consistence

157
00:13:50,669 --> 00:13:55,680
at the same time. So, either you can be very
powerful in the sense very expressive, that

158
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:59,800
you can talk about all kinds of things. All
you can be consistence, but not both at the

159
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:07,359
same time any should that this is something,
which will always followed if you try to

160
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,278
will power systems. And as some of might know,
his arguments are basically scented

161
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,809
around, self-reference and self-negating sentences.

162
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:23,899
So, sentences like I am lying or the story
about this barber, which resilient resolve

163
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:27,299
so
worried about that if there is the village,

164
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:30,359
in which the rule is that everywhere, who
does

165
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,100
not shave himself shaved other barber. Then
the question is who shaves the barber

166
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,610
essentially. Because, the barber if you shaves
himself then he shaving himself and

167
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,919
therefore, he cannot shave himself. Also this
kind of conundrums comes to selfreferentially

168
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,799
a sentences and curd ..

169
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:59,429
That any formals system, which is expressive
enough, will and a become in consistent,

170
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:07,310
which means in our the kind of things of day.
And that however, do logics are never

171
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,310
going to be consistent. And complete at the
same time will come to this versions as some

172
00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:17,078
letter point of time. But, the simpler logic
or first order logic are predicate logic is

173
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:19,579
good
enough for us. And first order logic can be

174
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,278
seen into capture everything appear doing
in

175
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:22,278
programming essentially.

176
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,789
So, our programs can whatever, we can express
in programs we can do consistently in

177
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:35,360
some sense. Now, this program LT produce some
shorter and more elegant proves that

178
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,919
were present in this principia mathematical.
This is a book barbers Russell and

179
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,360
Whitehead’s. And apparently, so this story
goes I do not know well it is true or not.

180
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
But,

181
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,419
.apparently the journal of symbolic logic
or journal of logic or something, refuse except

182
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:49,419
people.

183
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,549
Because, it is the authored by computer program,
co authored by computer program. I do

184
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,609
not know whether, stories true a not, but
you can find it in some places essentially.

185
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,610
.

186
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:05,269
So, let us first talk a little bit about Simon
and Newell. A Simon was a multi faceted

187
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:11,209
person as you can see, from this court from
Wikipedia. He was a political scientist

188
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:16,569
economist, sociologist, psychologist and a
professor mostly at CMU who’s research

189
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,640
range across all these fields cognitive psychology,
cognitive science, computer science

190
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,588
public administration economics and so on
and so forth. He went on get a Nobel Prize

191
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,400
in
economics.

192
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,389
And his long time associate was Allen Newell
about 10 years is junior. And they did a

193
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:37,769
lot of collaborative work together essential.
So, Allen Newell created this language for

194
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,839
IPL, in which LT was implemented.

195
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:41,839
..

196
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,140
Some little bit more on them, because they
give us something which we base our work

197
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:54,500
on. So, they became reading figures at CMU.
And they wrote this program for general

198
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,190
problems, which is based on even problem solving.
And how human beings use

199
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,949
heuristics solve problem. And we will visit
this general problem solve a idea, this idea

200
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:06,699
of
means on analysis, which is the heuristic

201
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,240
that views. We will see that sometime needs
in

202
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,079
the courts essentially.

203
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,069
Their work also brought to focus a information
processing approach to A I, which means

204
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:22,349
at you are talking about, that if you all
the create intelligence system. It is enough

205
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,879
to do
information processing. As approach to this

206
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:32,580
others stand of effort, which was to say that
will bill system form bottom of will put together

207
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,399
components, which make intelligence
systems and so on and eventually they will

208
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,960
come intelligence. He said not we do not
have to do that.

209
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,851
You can work are they information level was
A I some people call as a knowledge level;

210
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:49,240
and bell in the legend systems essentially.
And one of things which came out of CMU,

211
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,940
one of the many things which came out CMU
was this cognitive architecture call so or

212
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:03,920
which you can even or download and use to
bill a good application. So, one all the things

213
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,860
a talked about was this architecture for AI
what you neat for AI.

214
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,859
..

215
00:18:10,859 --> 00:18:15,619
So, you have this idea of the physical symbol
systems. And a symbol is something for as

216
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:19,849
we I concern, a perceptible something which
stand for something else. So, a symbol

217
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:26,230
stand for something else. If you write the
numeral seven, it stand for the number seven.

218
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,759
Of course, it is not the number 7, it just
stands for the number 7. We could have in

219
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,859
different script, we could have written it
differently. A symbol system is a collection

220
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,279
of
symbols.

221
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:43,319
So, for example, a data structure or English
language would or he one musical tune

222
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,109
essentially. So, you put them together you
have a symbol system. So, you have alphabet,

223
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:51,359
which is made of symbols and then you put
together things of alphabet and he have a

224
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,449
symbol system. And physical symbol is something
which obeys laws which have like the

225
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,538
laws of physics. So, in some sense, if you
can men ably if then using well define laws,

226
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:06,869
how rules then they are physical in that sense
they are physical.

227
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:11,369
In the sense they can be manipulating apparently
this law. So, anything you can use

228
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:17,250
algorithms or so the procedure for long division
for example and so on and so forth.

229
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,250
..

230
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,500
The important statement that they maid is
known as the physical symbol system

231
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,579
hypothesis. It says there the physical symbol
system as a necessary and sufficient means

232
00:19:27,579 --> 00:19:35,769
to generate intelligent action. So, what they
are saying, that earlier need in our

233
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:41,400
terminology, earlier need to bill intelligent
systems is the ability to create did the

234
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,682
structures. And right algorithm which will
operator from the data structures. You deal

235
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:48,029
nothing else essentially. That is the basic
infrastructure you need.

236
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:54,220
So, unlike for example, roger pen was who
feels set the human mind, a human brain has

237
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,450
some kind of physics, which is going on which
we cannot replicate reset nothing of the

238
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,360
slot. If you can do information processing
which means, if you can operate on symbol

239
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:09,089
systems using well define algorithms you can
create intelligent behavior. So, this is

240
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:15,459
known as the ability symbolic AI of classical
AI. Classical AI follows this principle that,

241
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,019
it is a top down design approach to build
in intelligence system.

242
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:24,980
So, that you will create your data structure
and you would like algorithm and you will

243
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:31,538
producer intelligence systems. Ours Haugeland
calls it good faction AI essentially. So,

244
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:35,308
as
a first symbolic classical AI, we have a sometimes

245
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:42,158
he call a sub symbolic systems or
signal level systems. Systems like human brain,

246
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,010
which operate settle level where
information is not and coded into symbol.

247
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:50,400
So, if you look at a neural network for

248
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,890
.example. It is made of many nods and many
edges collecting nodes.

249
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:59,610
And edges have values, which are numbers essentially
all weights as we call them. And

250
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:04,250
everything, that the Newell is encoded in
terms of those weight essentially. For the

251
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,769
weight itself does not stands for anything.
It was a mean anything to us. In that sense,

252
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,319
it
is not a symbol. A symbol should stand for

253
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,200
a something, where as if a writer a let us
say,

254
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,809
program in which variable call x, which stands
for let us say the distance from plays a to

255
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:22,819
plays b.

256
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:27,819
Then it is some it is a symbol. Because, it
is stamp for something. So, symbolic AI or

257
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:33,139
classical AI concern with explicit representation.
And I will go with them for working on

258
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,920
representations.

259
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,920
.

260
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,659
And that is what we a perusing here. So, we
have mention this Samuel’s Checkers

261
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:47,170
program he was also one of the participant
in this Dartmouth conference. And he is

262
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:53,650
contribution was this program to play checkers.
And he wrote it in this IBM 701

263
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,298
perusing. And as a bit earlier his goal was
so explode learning for computers. His idea

264
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:05,908
was at if computers could learn. Then they
would be known need to do all this pain

265
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:06,909
trekking programming.

266
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:11,320
.And when he says programming in the pain
trekking passion, he really means that.

267
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:16,899
Because, in those days be did not have this
whole set of high level language is that you

268
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,730
are so comfortable, which nowadays a you had
somely language. And maybe you, I am

269
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:27,660
not sure whether even four time was devise
at the time. List was devise a little bit

270
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,450
later
then the dark mouth conference. So, programming

271
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,620
was very pain sticking in those days.

272
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,869
And Samuel said that, if you can make the
machines learn then below have you program

273
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:42,369
them essentially. And you know that so fascinating.
So, the active idea, that you will

274
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:47,798
some system and little learn and become efficient.
And of course, we have a thriving

275
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:53,859
machine learning community .. So, his checkers
program Samuel

276
00:22:53,859 --> 00:23:00,558
was not great checkers clear. He was a computer
scientist. But, story goes that he wrote

277
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:03,720
this program the program became better and
better and better.

278
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:11,589
And eventually beep it is own creators as
be sick. You know this around the time. when

279
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:19,029
Babbage was constructing is machine. And we
have mention the his collaborator either

280
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:29,589
contuse of loveless, who was the daughter
of Lord Byron. And Lord Byron have this

281
00:23:29,589 --> 00:23:35,789
. peter shell end. And peter shell is a may
be wife was may be shell

282
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,658
he, who wrote this novel call Frankenstein.

283
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:45,919
And this novel I do not know . it is about
a artificial creature, you

284
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,340
know people were fractionated the artificial
creatures. So, this novel about this artificial

285
00:23:50,339 --> 00:23:58,308
future creature call vector Frankenstein who
was made by doctor. And eventually,

286
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:01,629
became like a monster, who would you known
destroy is the doctors essentially. So, that

287
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:06,500
whole idea, that this machine would becomes
smart and you know whole power us and

288
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:15,869
kill us have always been around for a long
time. So, you have seen the movie matrix.

289
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:20,859
So, that is one of the films and will come
to matrix again later for different reason,

290
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:23,379
so
quite an interesting film. But, one of the

291
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,230
I thinks in matrix is that this machines have
Clint to control human spices essentially.

292
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,019
So, you do not always realize it when you
was

293
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,148
things it film.

294
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:34,148
..

295
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:40,939
So, in 1940 sometime, I Isaac as Asimov who
was the science fiction writers. He

296
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,919
introduce the so called laws of robotics,
which we can many popular. It took the fancy

297
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:47,221
of
all the people around. He wrote it as part

298
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:53,890
of a slot story called run around, which he
wrote in 1942. So, they are the three laws

299
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,909
that Isaac of Asimov said. So, lose in the
sense

300
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:06,770
that, not like Newton’s laws, which we discover
that the physical world is the obeying.

301
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:15,658
But, mould like a laws at human beings make
you know, well legislation by the

302
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,309
parliament and so on essentially. So, for
example, our parliament is necking a law that.

303
00:25:21,308 --> 00:25:27,330
They cannot come under RTI essentially, so
this kind of laws essentially. So, his law

304
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,538
was
basically this three laws that the lowert

305
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:36,440
will not injure a human being. That is the
first

306
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,460
law. You know protecting the human spices.
Do a robot must always we built in such a

307
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,819
fashion that never harm human being essentially.

308
00:25:43,819 --> 00:25:52,859
Secondly, if will obey human beings at all
times. Unless it voyages rule 1, so if I build

309
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:59,808
the robot an I tell it to harm another person
then the robot should not obey too. And

310
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,629
thirdly, it must protect this old existence,
as long it does not by late the first two

311
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,350
laws.
So, it is you know all this is they in the

312
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:12,100
popular imagination, because people are worried
about machines over taking human beings. Already

313
00:26:12,101 --> 00:26:19,570
for 4 500 years we looking at talking
moving heads, which they think are thinking.

314
00:26:19,569 --> 00:26:25,369
.So, chess as we know, for many reasons has
been fractionation for computer scientist

315
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,829
for
ever since a computers go invented.

316
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:28,829
.

317
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:34,028
So, let us look at the quick history of chess
first. And then we look at a History of the

318
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:40,409
rest of the computing world. Before, we come
back to the question of what a minds and

319
00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:47,040
so on. So, you see all these name safe. And
all this materials been taking by taking from

320
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,019
Wikipedia. So, you just at ago to Wikipedia
at computer chess in you will see this time

321
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:57,308
line or part of this time line. So, clot channel
first wrote a paper called programming a

322
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,700
computer for playing chess.

323
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:05,720
To will in developed up on paper and algorithm
for doing it. McCarthy invented the

324
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,460
alpha beta I will go with them that we will
study. But, other people also set a have

325
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:16,210
invented a including a Samuel essentially.
Bernstein Alex once and who work then IBM

326
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,440
was the person to who wrote the first actual
program, which could play chess. Complete

327
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,140
program a, who could which could play a complete
game of chess.

328
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:33,440
Then program for Mack hack 6 by beam let was
first program should defeat a person in

329
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:41,140
tournament plays essentially. And we are already
mention David levy, who made this bet

330
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:47,640
in 1968 that no machine can him in 10 years.
And it 2008 the wrote this book call love

331
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,640
.and sex with robot essentiality. I when he
is swan from one end of capability of machine

332
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,580
intelligent to the other end. That they could
be like human companions to us.

333
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:06,509
In 1970 the American computer chess championship
started. In 1974 a program call case

334
00:28:06,509 --> 00:28:11,450
of from somewhere in the USS of won the first
. chess

335
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:19,169
championships and the small micro computers
subject playing chess in 1977.

336
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:20,169
.

337
00:28:20,169 --> 00:28:28,190
So, that was a initial years then in the latest
70 is the started making progress. So,

338
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:39,740
program call chess 4.6 well in the major chest
tournament. 1978 David levy one his that

339
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:46,740
defending a program call 4.7. In 1980 of Fred
kin price was institute it 100, 000 dollar

340
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,038
in
1980 was quiet the bit of women if a beating

341
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:57,970
of reigning world champion, program call
create it is. Now, creave was the you know

342
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,419
super computer, which of deal by same
..

343
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:03,520
And they was the fastest for seems for a very
long period of time the best and the fastest

344
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,289
machine for create a machines. And create
blitz all the program running on those

345
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:13,990
machine. So, it when is the championship with
the score of 5-0, which means it one all

346
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,470
the games. If the performance rating for those
of your family with chess rating 2258,

347
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:27,130
which is the quite good. And it was a first
program to be the human master. Along that

348
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:32,080
.time people certain it investing in special
purpose hardware to play chess essentially.

349
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:39,048
So, for example, a high tech mutual also developed
on this time in 1988

350
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:45,079
had 64 processors. One processer dedicated
for each where of the chess board.

351
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:48,859
And that, kind of think. So, Ken Thomson had
a hardware chess. So, people where

352
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:53,579
investing more and more hardware. And the
same time, so then a program call deep

353
00:29:53,579 --> 00:30:03,460
thought. Share the first place with Tony Miles
a head of the former was champion, not

354
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:12,350
the reigning world champion Mikhail Tal. So,
deep thought is a name, which does it ring

355
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:15,589
the bell for anyone.

356
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:16,589
. .

357
00:30:16,589 --> 00:30:23,379
He . to the galaxy. So, when as been taken
from there, it lost two

358
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,278
games to galicasple of 1989.

359
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,278
.

360
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:38,869
And after that, the years of tram for the
machine. In 1992 a micro computers program

361
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:43,819
one a computer chess championship playing
against mean free in some super computers.

362
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:48,769
A program call chess Genius actually, defeated
cast . game. In 1996

363
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:55,820
are program call deep loop, which was also
developed at IBM lost to cast Kasparov of

364
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,820
at

365
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,769
.a 1997 it beet Kasparov when a 16 match.
And it is creators a inventors or actually

366
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:07,250
awarded the Fred kin Price at . mention sometime
ago.

367
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:15,440
Then after was it was a series of losses for
the human players Kramnik do an 8 games of

368
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:26,590
program call deep flits. Then program call
hydra beet Adams 5.5 is to 0.5 which means

369
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:36,798
Adams could only do one game. Then Kramnik
lost two deep fritz later. And nowadays,

370
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:45,349
it is routine for the human players including
Vishwanathan Anandh from India to

371
00:31:45,349 --> 00:31:51,230
contently take help from machines, while preparing
their own chest playing strategies.

372
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:58,130
So, here we have a mention in 2010 Topalov
prepares by sparring against super

373
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,799
computer Blue Gene essentially.

374
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:01,798
.

375
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:17,000
So, let us move on to general AI and look
at what is happened since the dark mouth

376
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:25,190
conference. Before we come back to the main
question again essentially. So, just quickly

377
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:32,440
done through some of these things. We already
mention the general problems solved by a

378
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,850
Simon and Newell. Then known book on syntactic
structure, which was very influential

379
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:46,949
in natural languages .. McCarthy introduces
list ((Refer Time:

380
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:52,429
32:47)) wrote a program for . theorems in
geometry.

381
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,580
This was a part of PhD .. So, you will see
a list of people whose

382
00:32:56,579 --> 00:33:02,460
.PhD works appears in land marks in A I. So,
which is a kind of a motivation for some of

383
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:10,380
the PhD students setting here essentially.
So, Minsky and McCarthy set of A I lab in

384
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,140
59
. build us percept on. The percept was the

385
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,910
single layout Newell
network, which had this learning capacity.

386
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,700
So, that Newell networks was program, which
have basically pursuing this idea of learning.

387
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,798
You are training as he call it.

388
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:29,750
You show system of sequence of pattern a little
learn to recognize that pattern. Samuels

389
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,940
programs beat the best players. People also
started talking about machine translation

390
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,288
along that time. But, one of the early . set
that machine translation is

391
00:33:41,288 --> 00:33:48,640
not something that we can do so easily, which
is actually quite rule. In this early 60’s

392
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,919
the
first industrial lower started coming indica

393
00:33:51,919 --> 00:34:00,070
wrote his influential book on knowledge and
belief, which talks about how can you formal

394
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:02,700
the reason about what people you know.

395
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,240
So, I know that, you know that something you
know this kind of kripke. ((Refer Time:

396
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:14,908
34:08)) introduced a formal model for this
kind of reasoning call kripke structures.

397
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:21,210
There
was progress in a cad so other land million

398
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:28,679
wrote the program semantic nets. You knows
parcel on MIT was tested with this very well

399
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:36,909
known sentence time flies like an arrow
essentially. So, I would earlier to look at

400
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,450
this sentence and try to parse it. Now, the
thing

401
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:45,299
about our summons is that we always . to one
parts of this sentence.

402
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,820
Because, we are like and said pre dispose
to certain ideas award this world essentially.

403
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,419
So, well we here a sentence like time files
like an arrow. We do not even thing that it

404
00:34:56,418 --> 00:35:03,409
could have any other meaning then that time
is going fast very quickly essentially. But,

405
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:11,019
for a machines, which is not biased by h p
dispose ideas there could be other meaning

406
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:14,460
as
well. So, this is the an ambiguous sentence.

407
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,909
If you look at it from the fundamental point
of view, it could have other meanings and

408
00:35:18,909 --> 00:35:20,618
worlds could have a other meanings.

409
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:28,358
So, one of the problems in natural language
processing is that our language is so rich.

410
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:36,539
That we can say, the same thing in many different
ways. But, also conversely something

411
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,440
we say can have many different meaning essentially
you know. With you of course, were

412
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,820
useful for politicians, because a say something
and then they say that this, what a meant

413
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,420
out of corteges store something like that
essentially. So, this sentence time flies

414
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:53,110
like an
arrow. I would early to look at other meanings.

415
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:02,119
.So, a look up the web and a try to see, what
other past structures. So, when he say passed

416
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,430
we mean you know subject, object and you know
known face work frees and this kind of

417
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:17,419
essentially. So, it is time adjective is it
a verb. You can look at some of those option

418
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:23,320
essentially. A very influential book all computers
and thought by .

419
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,730
around that time. They were programs to do
in a we saw program for geometry.

420
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,449
Then we saw program for algebra by . a program
to answer

421
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:38,608
questions for people. You can put all this
things together and build the system, which

422
00:36:38,608 --> 00:36:40,150
can
you know.

423
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,150
(.)

424
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:48,680
Teeth somebody let us algebra or geometry
or something like that. In 65 Allen Robinson

425
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:53,819
introduce is varies this facets call the resolution
method for theorem proving which

426
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,300
revolutionize is whole idea of theorem proving.
By theorem proving we mean the kind of

427
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,269
seen that LT was doing logic theories was
doing. That given a set of axioms. So, given

428
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,380
a
set of flimsies what are the things that you

429
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,070
can proved from their essentially.

430
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:20,510
And there was other developments Herbert Simon
predicted in 1965 that by 1985

431
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:27,180
machines will do any work that man can do
essentially. You optimistic people, we have

432
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:32,618
seen then Allen Turing also said that by 2000
the during test would be past essentially.

433
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:39,989
.None of that has really happen. So, at the
same time Herbert refers argues against,

434
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:45,289
. we have seen Eliza earlier in 1967 refers
to a beaten by a chess

435
00:37:45,289 --> 00:37:48,679
program at chess.

436
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:57,009
Also there was this program call Dendron which
was one of the early successive of A I

437
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:00,849
we could do chemical analysis for us. So,
we will not going to the details now, but

438
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:03,160
later
on in the course we will see what Dendron

439
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,809
died. But, it was it officiate as the level
often

440
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:14,588
expert came is. Then mosses it is work on
symbolic reasoning in A I, which is also

441
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:20,710
common essentially. That everybody uses some
symbolic integration passages you know

442
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,349
mat lab, maxima and all these kind of packages.

443
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:31,929
Shaky the first robot appear then SRI’s
stand for research instituted. Minsky and

444
00:38:31,929 --> 00:38:34,759
paper
wrote this book on perceptions. We mention

445
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,079
perceptions they have single they have
neutron. What minsky and paper should in 1969

446
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,890
was that perception was limited to
recognizing only certain kinds of patterns

447
00:38:45,889 --> 00:38:50,338
essentially. And a kind of patterns at a person
from problem could recognized was pattern

448
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:53,159
at for linearly separable, which means that
if

449
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,779
you what the plot them in some space.

450
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,380
Let us a two dimensional of three dimensional
space, a let us a two dimensional space.

451
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,619
Then you goes draw straight line, which would
say a one side of the line is class a and

452
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:06,220
the other side of the line is class b. So,
such patterns have call linearly separable

453
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:09,608
patterns.
And what minsky and papered show would was

454
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:18,319
a that is all perception could do. And it
is said, that this skilled the research in

455
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,480
Newell quite a wild. It was not a till the
mid 80’s.

456
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,530
The people started getting interested in Newell
network again.

457
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:33,950
That is when they realize at multi laid Newell
networks. Have do not have this limitation.

458
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:42,169
That they are not limit it to finding only
linier separates. So, about that is what happen

459
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:47,260
in
69 essentially. So, shrank talked about is

460
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:52,810
contextual dependency theory. McCarthy talked
about the frame problem essentially. The frame

461
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,679
problem says, the refiar representing
about of wall. And if you a reasoning about

462
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:06,109
change in the world. How do you figure out
what is not change essentially.

463
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:13,140
So, if something was true, if may I watch
laying on the table here. And I look that

464
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:14,139
side

465
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:20,690
.for a few minutes. And then a look at this
again is a watch still there of course, I

466
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,630
can see
it is still there. But, in the reason system

467
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,070
after sometime after 2 hours will the watch
still

468
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,300
be there. Of course, they have a different
example log out a loaded gun, if you will

469
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,500
not
get into right now. So, let me say, what was

470
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:41,219
other staff so Nilsson and fikes demonstrated
this planning system call strips. We will

471
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:44,500
see, a strips later in this course.

472
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:49,489
And wino grad wrote the program call ., which
could do lateral

473
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:54,389
language conversation in a well limited domain,
the domain of blocks world. So, it could

474
00:40:54,389 --> 00:41:00,009
converse with a person taking instructions
and do things. So, he should look of on the

475
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,420
net. And you probably get a sample conversation.
So, you can say things like pickup the

476
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,110
green block and put it down talk of the red
one. And it could do that. Understand what

477
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,610
you saying and do that.

478
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:16,680
In the sense, it would generate a plan for
doing that essentially quite interesting.

479
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,549
Along
that time this language for log was device

480
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:24,150
by is French pan .. And
some more work on planning for example, apps

481
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,150
strips essentially.

482
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,150
.

483
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,280
So, here the picture of shakey. This was the
first autonomous robot that was built, which

484
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,510
could take it is own decisions. So, it could
one the a one coli does of SRI, which as stand

485
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:46,530
.for research institute. And do some limited
things like a open dose and plug itself or

486
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:56,089
getting charge then things like that essentially.
And so standard was another hotspot of a

487
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:02,269
activity people like Nilsson and many others
there. And some of the name set we

488
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:05,608
associate with a shakeys lisp came by McCarthy.

489
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:11,880
But, as go with them like is a star and strips
and visibility graph and collision detection

490
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,890
they were all discussed at time put.

491
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:17,889
.

492
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:28,139
So, let us move on, so and early 70’s. Schank
and Abelson introduce idea of a script.

493
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:34,409
This is if you on to understand remember this
cant says that we perceive the world in

494
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:39,489
terms of predefined a priory that is he call
them. What are those a priories. Schank and

495
00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:43,779
Abelson say, that these are like script. So,
it is like a movie script. That, you always

496
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,240
follow a script when you have acting. So,
if you so that the standard example that the

497
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:50,899
used was rest a gone essentially.

498
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:56,019
If you go to a rest around you a essentially
following a script. That this is how typically

499
00:42:56,019 --> 00:42:59,809
things are so if you here so the about somebody
going to rest around. Then you can

500
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:03,780
understand the story, if you have the script
in your head essentially. So, that is the

501
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:10,559
idea of
scripts. We already . Dendron another success

502
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:12,500
was mission. It was

503
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,480
.the rule based what people called as expert
systems. And the 80’s was the time and

504
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:19,230
people wanted to bill lots of expert systems.

505
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:24,059
By expert systems they meant a system, which
will capture the knowledge of an expert

506
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:31,460
typically, in a roof form we will see this
later in the course. And performer to expert

507
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,849
level essentially. So, minimal the program,
which this medical diagnose. Minsky wrote

508
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:43,070
about this names a advance version of Dendron
called . had some

509
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:50,740
learning capabilities. There were some more
planning systems. There is more work on

510
00:43:50,739 --> 00:43:53,989
visual representation.

511
00:43:53,989 --> 00:44:00,779
The power of metal level reasoning for example,
Randall Davis we see a another PhD

512
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:07,170
. program call A M, A M stood for applied
mathematician. Created

513
00:44:07,170 --> 00:44:13,108
quite it staff, when it was first published
essentially. So, if you look at some those

514
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:19,130
papers, which talk about A M. It was the program,
which len it claimed was doing

515
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:23,460
mathematical discovery. That you give it basic
concepts and little learn you thinks. So,

516
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,960
concepts like prime numbers, the concept of
prime number.

517
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,699
Not in algorithm to find prime or something.
What is the notion that some there

518
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:38,169
something call prime numbers len at claimed
his program could learn. And essentiality,

519
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,470
his thing was at it forward the heuristic
that go towards the extremes of certain kind.

520
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:46,739
And
one extreme is that number of devices pattern

521
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,598
number can have. So, one extreme is two
essentially. You cannot have less than two

522
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:55,930
devices except you know one and itself
counting one and itself. So, the smallest

523
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:59,419
number is 2, so those numbers are interesting.

524
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,230
So, len it claimed that his program was doing
that, but has it often happens, if will

525
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:09,769
discover that the lot of things for set of
encoded into his learning program itself

526
00:45:09,769 --> 00:45:14,099
essentially. So, that something that we have
to be very about essentially. Now, we write

527
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,240
a
program and we put in our knowledge some of

528
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:20,608
which in embedded into the program.
And then we say this system is discovered

529
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:21,608
that knowledge.

530
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:29,980
So, it talking about experts systems the system
called prospector, which was built at the

531
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:39,809
SRI for prospecting the natural world. Found
some unknown deposits of ((Refer Time:

532
00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:47,009
45:39)) in Washington state. So, Mitchell
events the concept of version spaces and so

533
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,010
on

534
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,050
.and so forth, which scripts some of these
things.

535
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,050
.

536
00:45:52,050 --> 00:46:02,560
And so you can them from the slides often
the Wikipedia page essentially. I want to

537
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,519
point out the some of this, newer things,
which were happening. So, one new thing we

538
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,250
was happening around this time was autonomous
vocals essentially. Can you have a car

539
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,130
which will drive it selves. So, arise earlier
1980’s people were building car it should

540
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:20,369
navigate themselves on the road so in unique.
The first car was done, then experts system

541
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:23,750
self started appearing in a market.

542
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:27,619
Another expert system call expand for configuring
vat system so was developed. The

543
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:32,920
triple A I conference that A I conference
started series started. In this design the

544
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,740
connection machine, which was maid suppose
to be machine of thousands of processes

545
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:45,049
connected together little bit like our own
brains are simple processing units connected

546
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:58,160
together. So, one interesting thing was this
program call Aaron develop by professor

547
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,618
Harold Cohen whose still around, which could
make drawing.

548
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:08,750
So, this drawing it is see there, painting
that we see there is been created by a program.

549
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:14,818
And when you say created, you mean visualized
and drawn. It is not somebody has told

550
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:19,559
the program draw man or something. The system
has drawn this whole thing itself. And

551
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:24,980
.if you look up Aaron on the web you will
see a whole gallery of his spin, it is paintings

552
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:33,250
so essentially. As she had try to get Allen
to draw the cover for my book. But, professor

553
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,608
co inside that know it not active any longer.

554
00:47:37,608 --> 00:47:38,608
.

555
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:50,980
So, some of work and 1990 this program called
TD gammon, which played the game of

556
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,630
bargeman using this technique call wean forcemeat
learning, in the course learning right

557
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:04,818
now in the department. Beat the became the
world champion in wage man essentially.

558
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:12,960
So, what tells is, so way these to robot cars
in 94, 95, if you look at 94, 95 we have

559
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,659
descriptions of robot, robotic cars which
can navigate themselves. So, here this car,

560
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:22,868
which one men from munic to coo pen Hagen
and came back all by itself essentially.

561
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:29,920
You driving, breaking, accelerating, avoiding
vehicles and so on and so forth. And this

562
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,119
already seen that 97 deep blue beat kasparov.
The Robocop to an aments started is a

563
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:47,470
football tournament for robots. Robotic toys
like this furby that you see there. The tiger

564
00:48:47,469 --> 00:48:53,379
electronics came into picture. So, these a
toys, which could furby apparently could learn

565
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,220
your language, you could teach it how to speak
this thing. Sony introduced this AIBO,

566
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:06,179
AIBO is that small dog like robot that you
can see in the picture on the bottom right.

567
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:10,909
So, there these to small dog like futures.
They are these Sony AIBO robots, which

568
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:15,940
.became very powerful of. In this picture
they are participating the Robocop football

569
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,130
tournament. So, you can see an orange colored
boll. They and you can see some different

570
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,039
proof humanity robots hanging around in the
side line.

571
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:26,039
.

572
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:36,699
So, you see this picture, it is robot call
kismet. Another PhD dissertation from MIT.

573
00:49:36,699 --> 00:49:40,230
A
robot that expresses emotion. So, again if

574
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:46,519
you go the web and look for kismachivels see
videos of Sethia talking to this robot and

575
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:52,030
robots smiling and you know, making all kind
of human express human like expressions in

576
00:49:52,030 --> 00:50:00,990
the system. The language ((Refer Time:
49:55)) web ontology language was standardized.

577
00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:07,568
A darpa introduce the grand challenge
in prize money.

578
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:15,210
Honda produce this robot call asimo is you
can see, the small nee length robot which

579
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:21,360
could work around at human piece. So, it is
not the easy problem to make up two legged

580
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:28,260
creature walk keep it is balance and walk
and thinks like that. And that became very

581
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,530
popular.

582
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,800
Recommendation

583
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,849
systems

584
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:32,849
started

585
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:33,849
coming

586
00:50:33,849 --> 00:50:34,849
into

587
00:50:34,849 --> 00:50:35,849
play

588
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:36,849
like

589
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:37,849
amazons

590
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:41,289
recommendations if you go to Amazon or flip
kart. And you look at the book, little all

591
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:45,639
immediately make some recommendation see you
the people bought this as well thinks

592
00:50:45,639 --> 00:50:46,759
like that.

593
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,500
.Collaborative filtering for those of you
attendant none stoke yesterday. He talked

594
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,500
about
collaborate of filtering recommendation systems.

595
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,929
When they was another dark mouth
conference in 2006 with said what is A I going

596
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:07,819
to be the next 50 years essentially.
Checkers the game of checkers was slot. What

597
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:16,190
do you mean by slot? Just as by solved
mean that if both the place are playing perfectly

598
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,400
we can tell you what the outcome will
be essentially.

599
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,329
So, we can do that for things like, smaller
games like cross and notes. A ticktack to

600
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:27,390
as it
is called. But, for checkers it was done quite

601
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:31,710
recently using expensive computing
essentially. So, we know that checkers is

602
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:39,960
the drawn game. Or maybe it is a wind
provided do not know. Then much more recently

603
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:46,260
ideas program call Watson, which
participated in this game call jeopardy, which

604
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:50,770
look upon the wave deeds the world
champions at this game essentially.

605
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:54,969
So, jeopardy is the program, which in which
we need lot of general knowledge,

606
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:58,730
geographic knowledge and thinks like that.
So, this program add axis to all this

607
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:04,199
knowledge and it could . game better than
human beings essentially.

608
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:14,750
And we mentioned last week this could this
robot call kerobo, which is a David levy was

609
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:19,489
talking about human companions to human being
essentially. So, this robot was saying

610
00:52:19,489 --> 00:52:22,679
him to space last week by the Japanese space
agency.

611
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:26,960
And it is man it has a human companion to
a human astronaut, which will follow in

612
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:36,230
November essentially. So, this a very brief
history of what has been happening in the

613
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:40,548
last
50 years, will stop here.

614
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,548
..

615
00:52:41,548 --> 00:52:48,329
And the next that we will followed is come
back to this question about, what are minds.

616
00:52:48,329 --> 00:53:06,589
So, that will be the last segment of our introduction
today’s essentially.

617
00:53:06,588 --> 00:53:16,588
.
