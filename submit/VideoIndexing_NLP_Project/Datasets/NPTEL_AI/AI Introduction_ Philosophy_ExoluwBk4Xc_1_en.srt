1
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:23,679
We are back. Having looked at the mechanical
side of this history of AI, we want to now

2
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:30,000
look at the philosophical side as you know;
this notion of the mind. What is the notion

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,118
of
the mind? How did this notion of the mind

4
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:37,450
ever come out? And how can we get it across
to the machines, essentially?

5
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,450
.

6
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:46,350
So, the medieval view, world view in Europe
was basically, a Christian adaptation of

7
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,329
Greek ideas, essentially. There was a big
gap between the Greeks and medieval Europe,

8
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,840
but the ideas that Greek started off with,
eventually, ended up with medieval Europe.

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,750
The
view of the world was of course, that it was

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:10,310
a very anthropocentric view of the world;
humans were at the center of the universe,

11
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,618
and everything revolved round the earth,
essentially. We look at some of those ideas.

12
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:24,109
What we are trying to see is how did human
beings, as gentian beings, have come up with

13
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:27,739
the notion of the mind? How would you
even imagine that there is something called

14
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,099
a mind? I mean, of course, you are there in

15
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:34,449
.the world; you are immersed in the world,
and you are interacting with the world. But

16
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:42,969
how do you come to this conclusion that you
have thoughts and ideas, which are in some

17
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,700
sense, existing independently.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:55,600
We start with the platonic view of the world;
the idea of which came from Plato. He said

19
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:03,449
that in the perfect world, there are this
creator's ideas; the God’s ideas. Our ideas,

20
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,510
the
humans’ ideas are derived from God’s ideas,

21
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:12,009
and the world itself, is derived from God’s
ideas. So, it is a very platonic view of this

22
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:17,199
whole world, and the world was corruptible
materialization of God’s ideas. You know,

23
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:20,328
that is why things were not perfect in the
world. Even though, God’s ideas are perfect;

24
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:27,360
the world is not perfect. Likewise, our
thoughts are true to the extent that they

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,579
are accurate copies of God’s ideas; that
was the

26
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:33,040
first starting point; Plato.

27
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:40,199
When we move we move on to Aristotel, Aristotel
derived the idea of the God and he

28
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:48,389
said that the world is out there, and human
ideas are human ideas, and they, in some way,

29
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:54,069
correspond to the world, essentially. So,
our thoughts resemble the objects at they

30
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,060
stand
for. If I am thinking of an apple, then my

31
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,810
thought of an apple resembles the apple,
essentially. This is known as the correspondence

32
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,489
theory of truth, essentially, and one
branch of philosophy, which was, it was taken

33
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:14,580
up by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who in his
early works, postulated something called the

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:22,000
picture theory of languages; that behind
every word, there is a picture; an image which

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,610
is sitting out there, essentially. So, this
is

36
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:34,289
how the world as we saw it. The earth was
flat at the center of the universe with the

37
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:41,239
Gods, heavens, rotating around it essentially.
The sensible world, the world at we could

38
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,158
sense, was composed a five elements

39
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,158
..

40
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:53,239
Quintessence, which was constant in the heavens,
did not change; constant in that sense.

41
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:02,730
Four are the elements, which are fire, air,
water and earth; listed in decreasing order

42
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:08,379
of
weight, essentially. So, you can find similar

43
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:13,500
ideas all over the world about, you know
what are the basic elements of the world,

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,228
essentially. So, if you ignore quintessence,
which is there in the heavens; we have fire,

45
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,939
earth, water and air. They are all jumbled
up

46
00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:29,350
on the earth, trying to find or striving to
find a rightful place; rightful place, meaning

47
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,629
by
order of weight, essentially. The earth should

48
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:36,721
be the lowest, and then, there should be
water, and then, air and then, fire. Different

49
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:42,879
materials had different amounts of these four
elements in them, and that is why, they behave

50
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:50,589
differently. For example, wood had more
water, and therefore, and some air, and therefore,

51
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:57,829
it floated on water, essentially.
Whereas, iron had more earth and therefore,

52
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,219
it sank in water, essentially. So, they could
explain why wood floated, whereas, iron sank

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,270
and so on. If wood were to catch fire, then
you know, it tries to escape into air. So,

54
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:12,149
there are this kind of explanations about
the

55
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:16,409
world, essentially.

56
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,410
..

57
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,640
This is how; the color inside this circle
is supposed to represent the color of the

58
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,149
sky. So,
you know, we have morning, day time, evening

59
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:34,560
and night. As the sun; it depends upon
the position of the sun; as the sun rotates,

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
our day changes, essentially.

61
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
.

62
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:44,920
So, this is a small animation I created of
what we thought about the world to be like.

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
This

64
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,670
.is how the world was; all the heavens were
rotating around the earth, and the earth was

65
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,930
the center of the universe, essentially. Now,
in those days, astronomy was for many

66
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:03,519
reasons, are very important science, and to
very empirical science; but it was difficult

67
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,529
to
explain the motions of the planets. For those

68
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:10,889
of you, who are interested in astronomy,
you would know that the stars are always in

69
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:12,539
the same position; the constellations that
we

70
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:21,170
see, Leo or Virgo or any of these. The constellations,
they always appear in the same

71
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,810
fixed pattern, throughout the year. It is
only the planets, which you know, move from

72
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,819
one
constellation to another, and it was very

73
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,819
difficult to explain; how they were operating,
essentially.

74
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,659
King Alfonso of Spain in 13th century got
so upset; that he said that if God had

75
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,910
consulted me when creating the universe, he
would have received a good advice. You

76
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,140
know, why have this planets move around in
erratic fashion, essentially. It is a quotation

77
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:55,449
I have got from book; I should have mentioned
it there.

78
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,449
.

79
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:04,730
Then, along came Copernicus. So, this is the
first, and this what (Refer Time.

80
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,960
says; the verge between thought and reality,
the first verge between thought and reality

81
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:16,229
was inserted by Copernicus, who says that
what we see, is not what really is. So, up

82
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,240
till
now, remember, this picture theory, the truth,

83
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,139
the motion of correspondence that our

84
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:24,639
.thoughts are in the image of what we see
around us, and that kind of a thing, that

85
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,579
our
thoughts reflect the world as it is. Copernicus

86
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:31,620
was the first person, who came and you
must be familiar with his book on the revolutions

87
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,300
of the celestial spheres. He said that
our Earth is not at the center of the universe.

88
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:42,519
In fact, the earth revolves around the sun,
and earth rotates, and creates the illusions

89
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:48,279
of day and night, and that kind of stuff,
essentially. The important thing from our

90
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:56,479
point of view is that what we see, is not
what

91
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:06,360
really is out there, essentially; so, the
verse as hogelensay between thought and reality.

92
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
.

93
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,400
So, all these famous characters; you have
encountered them in one way or the other.

94
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,719
We
know Galileo Galilei, because of the equations

95
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,440
of motion, for example, we always
attribute them to Galileo; v is equal to u

96
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,918
plus a t, and you know, that kind of stuff.
But

97
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:38,168
Galileo made this very important observation.
He said that perception is an internal

98
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:46,009
process. He says, and this is quoted to him;
I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so

99
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:50,939
on,
are no more than mere names, so far as the

100
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,920
object in which, we locate them, are
concerned. So, if you are smelling a rose

101
00:08:56,919 --> 00:09:00,000
and you feel that the rose smells nice, it
is

102
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,919
nothing to do; the notion of the smell of
the rose is not located in the rose, but it

103
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:09,709
is
located in our minds.

104
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,940
So, he says tastes, odors, colors and so on,
are no more than mere names, so far as the

105
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,490
.object in which, we locate them, are concerned
and that they reside in consciousness in

106
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,560
our minds, in other words. He says that hence,
if the living creature were removed that

107
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:34,699
we as a perceivers of this tastes and smell
and odors were removed, all these qualities

108
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:40,180
would be wiped away, essentially; that this
notion of taste and smell and color is

109
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:45,778
something that we have in our heads; it is
not the property of the object. So, he goes

110
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:50,110
on
to explain, for example, he imagines that

111
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:56,330
the notion of smell actually, happens, because
they are this particles, which are impinging

112
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,470
upon the inside of our noses, which results
in

113
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:05,040
certain sensation, which we call as smells.
It is very accurate as you can see, but Galileo

114
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:12,480
said that in the 17th century that perception
is an internal process, essentially. So, we

115
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
are
exploring this notion of thinking; how the

116
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,740
notion of the mind evolves? So, all these
are

117
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,940
European history, because AI, as we know it,
came out of European thought, essentially.

118
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,771
Even though, for example, other civilizations
like Indian philosophy, has a lot to say

119
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:42,729
about some of these concepts, like knowledge
and so on, but we are not, I mean, AI did

120
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,370
not come out of that, essentially.

121
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:51,629
Then, Galileo says that philosophy is written
in this grand book; The Universe. It is

122
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:56,059
written in the language of mathematics, and
its characters are triangles, circles and

123
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:00,419
other
geometric figures. So, when Galileo was doing

124
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:08,349
all these reasoning, algebra had not been
invented, essentially. In fact, his proofs

125
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,980
of the equations that we attribute to him,
like v is

126
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,580
equal to u plus at; are essentially, geometric
in nature. So, if you look at Hoggland’s

127
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,420
book, you will see some idea of how he draws
triangles, and says that this side represents

128
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:27,909
this; this side represents that; and the area
represents this; and that kind of thing. All

129
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:35,278
these reasoning were done; for him, mathematics
was geometry, and he says that the

130
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,429
whole world can be described in mathematics;
the language of mathematics; and its

131
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:46,080
characters are triangles, circles and other
geometric figures. So, you can say, this is

132
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:52,810
another step away from the fact that our ideas
are reflections of the real world out there.

133
00:11:52,809 --> 00:12:00,179
He is saying that you can think of motion;
the laws of motion are about moving bodies,

134
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,599
using the language of mathematics. So, the
very already, the representation has moved

135
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,820
to
something, which is different from the real

136
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:15,460
world out there, essentially. Next, we look
at;

137
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:23,310
so, Galileo showed that geometry could be
used to represent and reason about motion;

138
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:25,599
this is what we just said.

139
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
..

140
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,620
Then we come to the person, who Haugeland
calls as the grandfather of AI. It was the

141
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:39,870
English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, 1588-
1649, who first put forward the view that

142
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:49,519
thinking is the manipulation of symbols. This
is fundamental to AI, because after all, we

143
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,490
are talking about representing symbols and
manipulating them, and creating intelligence

144
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:58,830
out of them, essentially. So, Galileo had
said that reality is mathematical, in the

145
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,941
sense
that everything is made up of particles, and

146
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:08,160
our sense of smell or tastes as, how we
reacted to those particles. Hobbes extended

147
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:15,980
this notion to say that thought too was made
up of, or expressed in particles, which the

148
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,330
thinker manipulated. So, Galileo was talking
about the external reality, and how we can

149
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,940
represent, think about that, or talk about
that.

150
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,000
Hobbes is talking about the internal process
of thinking and saying that even thinking

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,778
is
basically, the manipulation of something,

152
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:36,730
which we called as particles, which we now
call as symbols, essentially.

153
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,700
However, he had no answer to the question
of how can a symbol mean anything, because

154
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,720
we will see that; for us, intelligence is
manipulating of symbols in a meaningful fashion.

155
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,440
Hobbes could never say how can a symbol, mean
anything. In fact, as Haugeland says he

156
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,720
could not distinguish, he could not tell us;
how minds are different from books. In the

157
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,730
sense that books are also collections of symbols,
and mind are also collections of

158
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:06,019
symbols, which we are manipulating; how can
the two be different, because the idea of

159
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:13,629
.meaning is very elusive. So, if I were to
ask you; how do you know the meaning of a

160
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:27,470
word? How would you, what would your answer
be? You just take any word. Let us say

161
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,278
Student: in terms (( ))

162
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,299
Prof: You could use examples.

163
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:42,409
In particular, I am talking about our standard
source of meaning, which is a dictionary.

164
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:48,539
So, if you want to look up a meaning of a
word, you go, and look up a dictionary. How

165
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:54,599
does a dictionary give us meanings, essentially,
because dictionary is only describing

166
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,430
words in terms of other words, essentially.
When you give examples; also, you are giving

167
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:04,449
examples in terms of other words. Where does
the meaning originate from? I mean is

168
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,330
there a fundamental source of meanings, essentially?
This is a kind of difficulty, which

169
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:16,050
Hobbes faces. Where does meaning come from,
essentially? We are also not able to see

170
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:21,529
where, the meaning comes from. See, for people
before him that the notion of an apple

171
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,149
is, because you see an apple, and that is
what it means. But when you talk about

172
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,990
language and thought and symbols; we have
this difficulty of saying where, does this

173
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,649
meaning come from, essentially; as a question
that we do not, we are not yet, answered.

174
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:36,649
.

175
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:43,899
.Here, is the picture of Thomas Hobbes in
the 16th century. In his book called De

176
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,669
Corpore, Hobbes first describes the view that
reasoning is computation. So, he is saying

177
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:55,679
reasoning is computation. By reasoning, he
says I understand computation, and to

178
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:02,588
compute is to collect the sum of many things,
added together at the same time, or; these

179
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:06,829
are very arcade languages; or to know the
reminder, when one thing has been taken from

180
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:15,429
another to reason, therefore, is the same
as to add or to subtract. Again, like I said

181
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:20,559
and
adding, subtracting, arithmetic is similar

182
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,789
to other kind, reasoning is similar to this
kind of

183
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:29,230
process, essentially. So, this quote, I have
taken from this source, which is the Stanford

184
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:36,430
encyclopedia of philosophy, and as we have
just mentioned, Hobbes was influenced by

185
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,528
Galileo; just as geometry could represent
motion, thinking could be done by

186
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:48,159
manipulation of mental symbols, essentially.
Does not name Hobbes ring a bell? Kelvin

187
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:56,350
and Hobbes; in fact, Hobbes was named after
Thomas Hobbes. Kelvin and Hobbes,

188
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:04,848
named after Thomas Hobbes; that is why he
is such a philosophical character.

189
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:05,848
.

190
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:13,308
When we come to Rene Descartes, again, another
great thinker from the middle times.

191
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:22,918
We know for many things, including in Cartesian
coordinates is named after Decartes.

192
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,129
He had come; remember, that all these things
was going on, these talking statues, moving

193
00:17:27,128 --> 00:17:33,378
things, and so on and so forth, and it had
become surf acceptable in Europe to talk about;

194
00:17:33,378 --> 00:17:35,858
these machines has being liked, in some sense,
essentially.

195
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:40,199
.So, Descartes, in fact, goes on to saying
that animals are wonderful machines; he just

196
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,249
makes the next step that they are not like
machines; they are machines, essentially.

197
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:49,480
Then,
he says human being were to, except for that

198
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:57,149
they process something, called a mind,
essentially. We will come to this Decartes

199
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:05,548
problem in a moment. So, just as Galileo said
that motion can be expressed in geometry;

200
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:07,970
Decartes said geometry could be expressed
in

201
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,700
algebra. Decartes is the one, who invented
this; we called coordinate geometry and, but

202
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:20,450
he went further; he says that even thought
can be expressed in the language of

203
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:28,859
mathematics and thoughts themselves, are symbolic
representations. So, you can see, he

204
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,949
is building upon what, Hobbes says. Hobbes
says that thoughts are symbols, and now, he

205
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,110
says that thoughts are symbolic representation
that we operate up on, essentially.

206
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:39,109
.

207
00:18:39,109 --> 00:18:46,069
But this is something, which is new which
Decartes brings in; the notion of the mind

208
00:18:46,069 --> 00:18:49,250
and
the body. So, Decartes is what we call as

209
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:58,240
the dualist, or belongs to this thinker, which
says that you know mind and body are two separate

210
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,239
things. So, we also, often called the
mind body dualism. So, as opposed to dualism,

211
00:19:03,239 --> 00:19:07,571
there are schools of thought, which are
monoist in nature, which believe that there

212
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,158
is only one kind of thing. For the first time,
Decarte is saying that two different kinds

213
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:17,980
of things in this world; one is this material
world, which he calls a body, and the other

214
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,159
is the mental world, which he calls as the
mind. He says that they are two different

215
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,859
kinds of things. The material world, of course,

216
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:27,898
.would obey the laws of physics and things
like that. We will see later that you know

217
00:19:27,898 --> 00:19:31,628
philosopher said that mental world also, should
obey such laws and so on, but they are

218
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:36,988
different world. The world of mind is separate,
and the world of body is separate.

219
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:43,169
And this is opposed to other kinds of philosophies,
other kinds of views in philosophy

220
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,850
that there is only one kind of thing. So,
there is the world of idealism, which says

221
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:49,888
that
there is only the world of ideas. So, for

222
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:56,158
example, in India we say that everything is
Maya; everything is the world of ideas and

223
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,730
matter is basically, a construct that comes
out

224
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,679
of our ideas, essentially. Very complicated
to think about, but may be you can reflect

225
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,139
upon that, a little bit. As opposed to idealism,
the other world is materialism, which says

226
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:14,788
that everything is matter, and the whole world
is matter, and the matter interacts in the

227
00:20:14,788 --> 00:20:19,858
certain way. Ideas and minds and all these,
kind of stuffs; they emerge out of this

228
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:25,628
somehow, essentially. So, they are different
viewpoints about what the world is like

229
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:30,128
there, and Decartes is a dualist. He said
that mind and body are two separate things.

230
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:33,918
He
says that a symbol and what it symbolizes

231
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,570
are two different things.

232
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:43,658
So, if I say chalk is a symbol, it is a compound
symbol made up of these letters, but it is

233
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,379
nevertheless, a symbol. So, chalk is a symbol
and this thing that I am holding in the

234
00:20:48,378 --> 00:21:04,209
hand, is what it symbolizes. So, this notion
that chalk; symbol chock is separate. Then,

235
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:16,829
we have this problem that a symbol is amenable
to algebraic manipulation. So, you can

236
00:21:16,829 --> 00:21:21,028
do thinking, what we call as thinking is basically,
symbol manipulation, which you can

237
00:21:21,028 --> 00:21:27,229
manipulate symbols. The subject of thought
is a world; the real world out there what,

238
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:29,880
it
symbolizes. They are different things; the

239
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,929
mind is different and the body is different.
Of

240
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:39,729
course, he had to answer questions like, you
know, because see, the body or the material

241
00:21:39,729 --> 00:21:44,278
world obeys laws of physics. The mind, of
course, was not clear how to operate it, but

242
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:48,700
it
was separate. He had to answer questions like

243
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,569
this; when, what makes a notation or a
symbol notation, suitable for symbolizing,

244
00:21:54,569 --> 00:22:00,489
and secondly, what makes a suitable notation
actually symbolize?

245
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:04,700
See this problem has occurred, because he
has separated the world of the mind and the

246
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,569
body. He says the mind is one thing, and the
body is another thing. A symbol is one thing

247
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:15,359
and what it symbolizes, is another thing.
So, the question is what makes a notation

248
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,500
suitable for symbolizing? Now, that is a question
that we are addressing now. When we

249
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:25,778
.write algorithms or when we talk about knowledge
representation, then we are

250
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,769
addressing this issue as to you know, what
is this? How do you represent? How do you

251
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,059
create a domain model, for example; how do
you represent the world so that, you can

252
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:40,569
compute up on that, essentially. That is an
easier part. A more difficult part is what

253
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:49,379
makes a suitable notion actually, symbolizes;
which means that if it is to be meaningful

254
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,859
in nature, then the world of symbols or the
world of thought, should be connected in

255
00:22:54,858 --> 00:23:00,408
some ways to the material world or the world
of matter. Because they cannot be

256
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:06,409
independent of each other they are not different
worlds that are, you know, operating

257
00:23:06,409 --> 00:23:12,080
independently. Our world of thoughts is, sort
of, close synchrony to the world of matters.

258
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,589
If we raise our hands, if we think about raising
our hands; we actually, raise our hands.

259
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:22,490
So, that kind of, how does the interaction
take place between the world of thought and

260
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:30,109
the world of matter. So, the question is how
can thought and matter interact; because the

261
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:35,908
world of thought is different. Matter, of
course, behave, sort of, obeys the laws of

262
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,629
physics. What about the world? The world of
thought is not made of matter; it is a

263
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:45,548
different world. How can it interact with
matter; that is a question that he could never

264
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:53,119
answer; the mind body problem, essentially,
or the mind body dualism, essentially.

265
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:54,119
.

266
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:58,418
So, this brings us to what we can call as
the paradox of mechanical reason; this term

267
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:02,999
is
by John Haugeland in his book. The paradox

268
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:05,649
says that if reasoning is the manipulation
of

269
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:14,038
.meaningful symbols, according to rational
rules; remember, that we are talking about

270
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:20,369
manipulating symbols says there are well defined
ways of manipulating these ideas. It is

271
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:24,989
not like you are doing it, randomly so, according
to well defined rules. So, if reasoning is

272
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,419
a manipulation of symbols, according to these
rational rules; who is manipulating these

273
00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:37,019
symbols? Because this question of meaningful
manipulation is coming; our thoughts are

274
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:42,079
not independent of the real world, essentially;
they have to be connected to that,

275
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,819
essentially. If a fast bowler is running up
and bowling, thinking of bowling and in swing

276
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:52,990
around something, he better be able to produce
the real in swing if he is worth, he solved.

277
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,009
How is his thoughts related to the real world,
essentially? Who is manipulating the

278
00:24:58,009 --> 00:25:11,899
symbols, essentially? It is a difficult question
to answer, because what says is that it can

279
00:25:11,898 --> 00:25:19,878
be either be mechanical, according to some
fix set of rules, or it can be meaningful.

280
00:25:19,878 --> 00:25:23,558
How
can it be both? You cannot have a mechanical

281
00:25:23,558 --> 00:25:27,740
system, being meaningful at the same
time, and by meaningful, we mean paying attention

282
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,239
to the mean of what is happening.

283
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:38,710
How can a mechanical manipulator pay attention
to meaning? Remember, that they are

284
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,808
not talking about AI or any such thing; they
are talking about human cognation; they are

285
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:48,899
talking about human minds; how human minds
operate, essentially? So, they are trying

286
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,440
to analyze that, essentially. Decartes said
that there is a world of the mind, which is

287
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,690
the
symbol processing. Then, there is a world

288
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,669
of the body, which is the real world, made
up

289
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:02,940
of physical matter, but they are closely tied
together. So, when I am thinking about some

290
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,849
real world in a meaningful fashion; if I have
got two pieces on a table, let us say, a cake

291
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:15,538
and a sandwich, and thinking about them. I
have to decide, should I pick up one of them;

292
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:20,720
I am thinking about some real things in the
world, in a meaningful fashion. My thoughts

293
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,489
about the cake and the sandwich are about
real things, and I making some decisions;

294
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:31,169
should I eat this, or should I not eat this
or something like that. So, this meaningfulness;

295
00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:35,090
where does that come from, essentially? How
can a mechanical manipulator pay

296
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:40,028
attention to meaning; it is a question I would
ask you to ponder over a little bit, and see,

297
00:26:40,028 --> 00:26:45,989
whether you know, may be like Pen Rose said,
human beings are special. There is

298
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:51,110
something special happening in our brains,
which allows us to do this, or like Grafus

299
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,189
said
that there are some instincts that we have,

300
00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:03,749
which we cannot automate, but of course, I
will take the opposite group.

301
00:27:03,749 --> 00:27:11,788
So, this led to a lot of debate in his time.
This is, we are talking about Decartes still,

302
00:27:11,788 --> 00:27:12,788
Rene

303
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:18,278
.Decartes, and his mind body dualism. Some
people attribute the fact that you know, it

304
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,378
is
said that Decartes, who also gave us a phrase

305
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:31,798
Cogito Igo, some I think, therefore, I am.
Apparently, he is claimed to have a proof

306
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,329
of the God exists, essentially, and the proof
is

307
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:45,468
tied to the fact that there is this difficulty
about how do symbols get manipulated in the

308
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:52,960
meaningful fashion, but his contemporary is,
of course, did not accept any such thing.

309
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:01,319
They would, in fact, mock him about you know,
this idea. So, we can imagine a little bit

310
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,898
like the Chinese room, which you have not
discussed in detail. Just imagine that your

311
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:08,468
brain is a Chinese room, full of symbols.
There is somebody, manipulating those

312
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:12,230
symbols according to some rules. Who is that
somebody; that is the question that we

313
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:16,429
asking. So, people would mock at Decartes
and say that there is a little man sitting

314
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:18,980
in
your head, who is doing manipulating these

315
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:28,690
symbols, but the problem is as you can
imagine; this explanation does not work, because

316
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,159
the next question that you would ask is;
how does the little man operate? Little man

317
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:40,749
has his little brain in his little body, which
has little symbols inside his head, and who

318
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:44,500
is manipulating those symbols. So, there
comes an infinite review, essentially, and

319
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,919
people say that this is what, led to Decartes
claim that he can prove that God exists, essentially.

320
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,759
But in the real world, what was happening
as to this question to who people,

321
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,749
philosophers have tried various kinds of explanations;
something called the faculty of

322
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:07,639
will, which we cannot quite define, or transcended
ago, or as I said, the people who used

323
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:12,269
to mock him and say, there is a homunculus.
Remember, the homunculus of nearby

324
00:29:12,269 --> 00:29:21,368
parcel; a little man sitting inside. So, that
is a fundamental question one has to answer.

325
00:29:21,368 --> 00:29:28,949
We say that if you are in modern day world,
going to write programs, which will operate

326
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,080
according to the algorithms that you are putting
into those programs; how can they be

327
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:39,898
doing meaningful things? It is roughly equaling
to that, essentially, or I might say that

328
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,339
if
I want to implement a neural network, which

329
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:47,408
is; I know that the structure of a neuron,
and how it operates, and so on and so forth,

330
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:54,269
and I am just connecting together hundreds
of thousands of neurons. How can that evolve;

331
00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:57,120
do meaningful things like character
recognition? Of course, we know that it can

332
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,288
be done; character recognition can be done,
but the fundamental question is that; is that

333
00:30:01,288 --> 00:30:03,950
intelligent, or is it doing something that
we

334
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,729
have asked it to do.

335
00:30:05,729 --> 00:30:11,450
In fact, he said that the computer can only,
do what is instructed to do; nothing more

336
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,450
than

337
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,840
.that, which is of course, true at a very
fundamental level. Some recent thoughts on

338
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:21,898
who is
doing this manipulation, thinking, there are

339
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:23,689
some very interesting books, and for those
of

340
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,558
you are interested; I would recommend them.
All of three have a common author called

341
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:35,819
Douglas Hofstadter, who is in the Indiana
University. His famous book was Godel,

342
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,808
Escher, Bach. He and Dennet, wrote a series,
collected a series of articles called The

343
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:47,028
Mind’s Eye. More recently, he has written
a book called I am a Strange Loop. So, he

344
00:30:47,028 --> 00:30:50,319
is
trying to; Hofstadter is also trying to answer

345
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,210
this question; I mean, instead of saying who,
he is saying what is this notion of I that

346
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:02,249
I have, as a as a human being that I have,
essentially, or I or you, essentially. If

347
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:05,929
I talk of you as a person; what do I really
mean,

348
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,320
essentially? What is that you, essentially?
I say that my body, my mind, my hands, my

349
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:21,509
eyes, my feet, my whatever; what is this I,
which is saying my, essentially? That is the

350
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:26,469
question, which Hofstadter is trying to answer,
and he, sort of, uses a combination of

351
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:34,159
emergent behavior and self-essential loops,
which we do not have time to get into here,

352
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:39,740
but I would recommend one of these books;
they are quite easy to read and quite

353
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:47,919
interesting. So, let us move on from Decartes
to John Locke, known as the father of

354
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,590
classical liberalism.

355
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:51,589
.

356
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:52,589
.

357
00:31:52,589 --> 00:31:56,528
His theory of mind is often cited as the origin
of modern concept of identity and the self,

358
00:31:56,528 --> 00:32:02,190
essentially. It influence other philosophers
like Hume, that we will see and Kant that

359
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,190
we

360
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:10,659
.will see, in a moment. He postulated that
mind was a blank slate, as opposed to what

361
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,669
Thompskey says that we are born with an inbuilt
grammar or the universal grammar in

362
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:22,049
our heads. Locke said that the mind was a
blank slate or tabula rasa as he called it,

363
00:32:22,048 --> 00:32:25,098
and
that we are born without innate ideas, and

364
00:32:25,098 --> 00:32:31,058
as you can see in the last two lines; knowledge
is determined by experience derived from sense

365
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:37,499
perception. Whatever, we know in our
heads is the result of whatever we have experienced

366
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:43,110
in the world, and experience leads to
knowledge, essentially.

367
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:44,109
.

368
00:32:44,109 --> 00:32:49,838
One of his elaborators or followers, David
Hume, Scottish philosopher, whom

369
00:32:49,838 --> 00:33:02,419
Haugeland calls as a mental mechanic. By this,
we mean a mechanic, who is operating in

370
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:11,558
the mental domain. It was empiricism and in
his book called Treatise of Human Nature,

371
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:16,979
he strove to create what he called as the
science of man that examined the psychological

372
00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:20,510
basis of human nature. He said that everything
is tied up to human nature. If you can

373
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:24,528
understand human nature, you can understand
how human beings behave and what else

374
00:33:24,528 --> 00:33:28,848
is there, essentially. Science and everything,
derives from there. He follows this idea of

375
00:33:28,848 --> 00:33:34,829
experience and observation as a foundation
of logical argument. He was an admirer of

376
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:42,069
Newton, and he says in a manner in which,
Newton express the movement of heavenly

377
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:44,759
bodies over planets and so on.

378
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,710
.He says that impressions and ideas are like
basic particles to which, mental forces and

379
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:57,788
operations are applied. Just as Newton is
giving the laws of physics, Hume is saying

380
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:01,679
that
there is a law of mental activity; law of

381
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,528
associations, as he called it. They were;
mental

382
00:34:06,528 --> 00:34:10,000
ideas were like particles. He is not saying
that they were particles; they were like

383
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,989
particles to which, mental force and operations
are applied. Further, like Newton, he does

384
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:23,289
not care as to how that is happening. So,
Newton had never explained how gravity

385
00:34:23,289 --> 00:34:27,271
happens, or you know why gravity happens;
there was no explanation behind there. He

386
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:31,019
just gives the laws of gravity, and says that
this is how planets are moving around the

387
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:35,489
earth, and it is explained by gravity. So,
Hume does the same thing. He does not try

388
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:37,240
to
explain how it is happening; he says that

389
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,719
this is what is happening, and it can be
explained by these laws; do not ask me, why

390
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,059
it is happening, like that, essentially. But
he

391
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:51,239
could not explain, however, what made ideas,
ideas, now. It is like that once, you say

392
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:56,379
these are particles, which are obeying these
laws, and then why are these ideas,

393
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:01,570
essentially. What makes their interaction
between different ideas count as thinking,

394
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,400
essentially? So, he is done away with meaning,
all together.

395
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,400
.

396
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,490
So, the last person, we will visit today,
is Immanuel Kant, German philosopher, widely

397
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:20,759
considered to be central to modern philosophy.
In fact, when I was in undergraduate, we

398
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:29,860
had a whole course, which data comparative
analysis of Kant and Mills philosophy. He

399
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:37,530
.says, and this is very interesting; they
have come a long way in this short period

400
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,320
of time.
From this notion that the world is out there,

401
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,130
and we are simply saying the world; the
correspondence theory of knowledge and then,

402
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,590
mind body dualism and then so; Kant has
come to the other theory. He says the mind

403
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,681
has a priori principles, which make things
outside conform to those principles. These

404
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:06,280
are some very consistent, with some very
modern ideas. For example, some very recent

405
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,930
research in computer vision; the simple
view of computer vision would be like the

406
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:16,889
correspondence theory of knowledge that you
get the image of things, and you do image

407
00:36:16,889 --> 00:36:20,629
processing, pattern recognition, feature
extraction, and all these kind of stuff, and

408
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,519
then, you understand what is happening. It
is a

409
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,230
forward process from the world to the mind.

410
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:32,679
Modern theory says that we have preconceived
notions of what we are trying to see, and

411
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:39,029
what we see is already there, in our mind
to some extent; this is what Kant has said.

412
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,559
The
mind has a priori principles, which makes

413
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:45,880
things outside conform to those principles.
Then, he says that mind shapes and structures

414
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,530
experience; it is a mind which shapes
structures and experience, so that, on an

415
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,470
abstract level, all human experience shares
essential structural features. All our mind

416
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:00,759
operates in the same way. That is why we are
able to communicate; that is the question

417
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,260
that one could have asked. How one human
being can communicate ideas to another human

418
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:11,810
being? He says fundamentally, the mind
has a similar structure. Then, he of course,

419
00:37:11,809 --> 00:37:15,900
goes on to explain that the concept of space
and time are integral to human experience

420
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,309
that you cannot operate without them, as are
the notions of cause and effect, essentially.

421
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:30,259
What causes? Causal theory is basically, a
mental theory. In the real world, I mean,

422
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,590
we
have these cause and effect kind of a motion

423
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,289
that if I turn a switch on, the light will
come

424
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:38,869
out. But the physics does not recognize any
cause or causal theory. Physics only

425
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:42,949
recognizes the equations; it goes from one
equilibrium state to another equilibrium state;

426
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:51,129
there is no causal thing, but these are fundamental
to our thinking, essentially. So, the

427
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:56,420
second last paragraph is very interesting.
He says that we do not have direct experience

428
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,980
of things, and we will visit this in the next
class, which we have on Wednesday. We will

429
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,579
come back to this question. After, as he called
is the nominal world or the real world

430
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:12,969
outside, we do not have direct experience
access to the real world, but what we do

431
00:38:12,969 --> 00:38:17,519
experience is the phenomenal world, as conveyed
by our senses. So, we cannot; you

432
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,519
.know, this is the very philosophical question.
If you look at some Indian philosophies,

433
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,619
like Buddhism, they ask this same question,
again that what is there in the mind, is what

434
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:36,230
we think, essentially. That is what Kant is
saying, essentially. He says that human

435
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,429
concepts and categories, structure the view
of the world, as we see it, essentially.

436
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:41,429
.

437
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:42,429
.

438
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:47,000
So, the world is not as it is out there, but
as we see it, essentially; the world as we

439
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,980
know
it. So, this is known as the subject-object

440
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,760
problems. A longstanding philosophical issue
is

441
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:58,660
concerned with analysis of human experience.
So, the question is that the world consists

442
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:03,879
of objects and entities, which are perceived,
or otherwise, presumed to exist as entities

443
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,289
by
subjects; there is the subject. So, we think

444
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:09,570
that the world has this object out there,
and

445
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:19,289
how does that happen, essentially. There are
some technical terms, which we should be

446
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:28,029
familiar with. The subject-object problem
has two primary aspects; first is what is

447
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:34,570
known; what can exist out there, and this
is something that we call as ontology, which

448
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:42,269
became very popular in current day computer
science. So, the field of ontology deals

449
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:47,619
with questions concerning what exist, or what
can said to be exist, actually, and how

450
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:52,609
such entities are grouped together, essentially,
related within a hierarchy and that kind of

451
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,150
a theory.

452
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,420
Nowadays, computer scientists talk a lot about
ontology, and in the concept of the

453
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,539
.semantic webs. So, we have one computer,
talks to another. One computer sitting here

454
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:07,349
to
meaningfully, talk to another computer, and

455
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:13,599
we have the social of ontology and
taxonomies, which we may not have time to

456
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,610
go through in this course. The second
standpoint is how does one know what we know;

457
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:24,039
and this concerns epistemology;
questions as to how knowledge is acquired.

458
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:29,610
So, ontology says what can exist, and
epistemology is concerned with how do we get

459
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:42,550
the real facts of, for example, why was
Durga suspended; epistemic question. How do

460
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,021
we say that this is what is really,
happened out there, essentially; is the question

461
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:49,490
of knowledge acquisition or
epistemology.

462
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,489
.

463
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:57,759
The bounds of our own mind; he creates. Kant
says that he has done something, like a

464
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,540
Copernican revolution in philosophy; what
he calls as a critical philosophy. So, he

465
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:06,250
says
that two things; one is the epistemology of

466
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:11,989
transcendental idealism, which says that we
are not able to transcend the bounds of our

467
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,899
own mind. We can only perceive the world
through the prism of our mind, in some sense;

468
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,340
through the spectacles of glasses as mind,
and we cannot exceed that. So, we cannot access

469
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,410
the real world out there; only, what our
mind allows us to see. Already, the notion

470
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:36,690
of mind has become prominent, essentially.
The moral philosophy in those days was not

471
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,230
quite what we talk about it as right now,
but

472
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:43,309
something, to do with the mental world. The
moral philosophy of the autonomy of

473
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:48,190
.practical reason; he says that practical
reason can be automated.

474
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:56,849
May be, this is the last thing I will leave
you with. Conceptual unification and integration

475
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,069
is carried out by the mind through concepts
or the categories of understandings. So, this

476
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,769
is again, those terms, some ontologies are
coming up. We have concepts about things.

477
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:10,119
We know, we have categories of birds, and
flowers, and apple, and fruits; all these

478
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,529
kind
of categories or things, operational on the

479
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,420
perceptional manifold, which is build within
space and time. Space and time is something,

480
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:22,019
fundamental to our minds. Our minds think
in terms of space and time, and everything

481
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:28,869
that we think about is located within our
notions of space and time. They are not concepts,

482
00:42:28,869 --> 00:42:33,849
but are forms that are a priori
necessary conditions for any possible experience.

483
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:36,719
He says that without the notion of
space and time, you would not have been able

484
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:43,969
to imagine the world, and think about the
world. Thus, the objective order of nature

485
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,589
and the causal necessity that operates within
it

486
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:53,360
are dependent upon the mind’s processes,
which he called by a product of rule based

487
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,490
activity, which he called as a synthesis.
So, the emphasis is totally, shifted to the

488
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,029
human
mind. It is a human mind, which shapes the

489
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:05,300
way we see the world, and we reason about
the world, and everything is dependent upon

490
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,960
that. So, from a notion when we did not
even have a notion of a mind, and then, gradually

491
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,760
we said thought and reality is different,
and then, mind body is different. Kant has

492
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,510
come, taken us to a point, which says that
our

493
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:23,380
interaction with the world is controlled by
our minds, essentially.

494
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,380
..

495
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,500
So, this is what we will do in the next class.
Just to remind you of the goal that

496
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,739
Haugeland that we had said. The goal of AI
is to build the machine with a mind of its

497
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,559
own. So, in the next class, we will come back
to this the cantian view of the mind, and

498
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:44,110
discuss a little bit more, and may be, wind
up with the introduction in that on next

499
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:59,829
Wednesday.

500
00:43:59,829 --> 00:44:09,829
.
