1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:18,080
So, we are looking at logic and listening
and we are looking at propositional logic,

2
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:29,498
so
just to do a quick recap.

3
00:00:29,498 --> 00:00:30,498
.

4
00:00:30,498 --> 00:00:40,739
.We first look at the language 
and the language is made up set of propositional

5
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:53,230
symbols I
do not remember what the symbol we use anyways.

6
00:00:53,229 --> 00:01:02,988
So, something like this accountably,
if a set of atomics symbols and each of these

7
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:07,069
symbols stands for a sentence and we do
not particularly care about its stands for

8
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:18,319
essentially. Associated with this set of symbols
is a function v which map p this symbols to

9
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:28,280
set let say true and false basically a two
value set which as far as we are concerns

10
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:42,909
will stands for true sentences and false
sentences. Then, we have connectives 

11
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:53,618
and or not imply and so on, which gives lies
to a

12
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:59,078
set of sentences, so we will call them a set
of formulas.

13
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:14,810
Let us call set f, so we could construct compound
sentences from the atomic using the

14
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:25,240
logic connectives and associated with this
set of formulas is a function with maps f

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,050
to the
same set true or false. So, this side is the

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,939
syntax and that side some sentence semantics
of

17
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:40,300
this thing and what the semantics captures
here is that how do this logical connectives

18
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,000
connect the or influence the meaning of compound
sentences essentially and that is given

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,580
by this. So, if you remember for example,
a sentence like p and q would map to true

20
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,280
if
both p map to true and q map to true and so

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,400
on. So, now, given a sentence f belonging
to

22
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,730
f or formula f belonging to f, so for example,
you might say something like p and q

23
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:17,250
implies r or not.
Then, p implies some such formula re arbitrary

24
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,129
formula, which can be constructed using
this logical connectives p q r and s are the

25
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:28,799
atomic symptoms and implies of or not
implies other connectives. Essentially, we

26
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,590
can find a valuation for this if you know
what

27
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:39,640
the valuation for p q r and s is, so if you
know for example, the p is true, let us say

28
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,399
every
p q r s everything is true and this true implies

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:54,189
true or false implies true. So, this whole
thing will evaluated to true essentially,

30
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:57,439
so this was the notion of truth this is the
notion of

31
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:11,870
truth. It says that given a sentence f belonging
to this set of synthesis there we can

32
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,899
compute whether the sentences true or not
given a sentence and given a valuation v.

33
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,179
For all the atomic sentences, we can compute
whether the given sentence match to true

34
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,340
or false essentially and I do not remember
whether we discussed this, but in general

35
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:32,429
a
formula can fall into three categories one

36
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:43,959
is a valid formula. So, we say f is valid
if for

37
00:04:43,959 --> 00:05:02,189
every valuation we that we can think of Val
f is equal to true, so you are familiar with

38
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:08,870
this notion I just repeating this. So, when
you say for every valuation v essentially

39
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,639
we are
talking about the truths table for the formula.

40
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,639
So, this formula for example, we can
construct the truth table which will have

41
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:22,449
16 rows because there are 4 propositional

42
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,590
.atomic sentences, which means p can be true
or false q can be true or false, r can be

43
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:29,109
true
or false or and s can be true or false.

44
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:35,770
For each of these 16 valuations or each of
the sixteen rows in the truth table if the

45
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:38,230
last
column is label with true then we label then

46
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,879
we say the sentence is valid. So, a sentences
is valid if is true for all possible valuations

47
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:55,199
a trivial sentence which is valid is for
example, p or not p this is of course there

48
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,050
is only one variable, but this is a valid
sentence

49
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,569
also known as the tautology always true.
.

50
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:08,590
.
We say that the sentence is satisfiable or

51
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:16,028
the formula satisfiable if for some valuation
v

52
00:06:16,028 --> 00:06:21,829
this is true the same thing accept that instead
of every v use term some. If you can find

53
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,589
at
least one valuation which will make this true

54
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:33,500
then that sentence is satisfiable for
example, I might say p implies q 1 simple

55
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,550
sentence not always true for example, if p
true

56
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:44,128
and q false this is false. I can find valuations
of p and q usually make this true if there

57
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,509
are
3 valuations which will make this true such

58
00:06:47,509 --> 00:07:05,180
sentences is also sometimes call contingent
sentences. So, one is valid the second is

59
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,968
satisfiable or contingent and a third is
unsatisfiable.

60
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:21,610
Here, we replace this with no if there is
no valuation which makes this sentence true,

61
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:34,468
then it is unsatisfiable example as you can
this something like p and not p essentially.

62
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:41,918
So,
in general there are three kind of sentences

63
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,478
valid satisfiable and unsatisfiable. All are
seen notions are used somewhere or the other

64
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:52,699
as we will see later essentially, so when
we

65
00:07:52,699 --> 00:08:00,449
.talk about truth we also say we sue this
symbol to say that a formula is valid, you

66
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:03,158
can use
say using this essentially.

67
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:04,158
.

68
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:12,709
.
Then, there is a notion of entailment if now

69
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:17,329
this is an interesting notion because in when
we study logic the reason we study logic is

70
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:21,778
to we are able to capture valid forms of
argument. Essentially, we are not so much

71
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:25,819
interested in saying can we find the valuation
which will make the sentence true or not we

72
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,509
are more interested in saying that if
somebody has given you a set of premises or

73
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:40,740
a set of axioms. Then, does some other
sentence follow that essentially, so given

74
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:54,539
set of s sentences we say that a formula f
is

75
00:08:54,539 --> 00:09:22,329
entailed by s, which we write as f entails
s if the following is true if for every 

76
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:30,700
that makes
s true and when we say a set of sentences

77
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,180
is true essentially.
What we mean is that every sentence in that

78
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:42,329
set is true, so you can think of it either
bigger sentence with the sign in between their

79
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:54,900
essentially. So, we are more interested in
the notion of entailment that somebody give

80
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,329
us the set of premises let us call them s
then

81
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,680
we want to ask whether a given formula f is
true or not essentially. That is notion of

82
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:16,328
entailment essentially, so these concepts
are kind of semantics concepts.

83
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:17,328
..

84
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:27,189
On the other hand we have the notion of provability,
so if you recall we did a small proof

85
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:41,820
in the last class notion of provability is
tied up with the rules of inference. For example,

86
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:52,240
most commonly used tool of inference call
modus ponens and we express it follows like

87
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:06,639
if you have alpha and if you have alpha implies
beta then entails beta. So, last time we

88
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,319
wrote with as three separate lines alpha and
then alpha implies beta below and then beta,

89
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,350
but this is just another way of writing it.
Essentially, you are saying that if you are

90
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,850
given
the alpha and if you are given alpha implies

91
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,769
beta, then you can derive beta or in some
signs you can add beta to your set of sentences.

92
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:29,059
So, notion of provability is a or the notion
of proof is the entirely syntactic concept

93
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:32,549
if
simply says that given set of formulas, you

94
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:39,179
can keep adding new formulas to the system
and this particular rules says that is you

95
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,629
have a formula which matches alpha. If you
have

96
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:46,029
another formula which matches alpha implies
beta, then you can add the formula which

97
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:50,439
matches beta to the set essentially this alpha
and beta could be arbitrarily compound

98
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,410
from. They do not have to be atomic form,
essentially it is just s it is just a pattern

99
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:58,819
that a
pattern the same thing must be here of course

100
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,100
alpha can be any formula. If that formula
implies beta is present in the data base or

101
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,370
nor it be a set of sentences, then you can
add

102
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,679
this.
So, the proof finding algorithm is basically

103
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:18,039
a simple algorithm which keeps which does
the following select a rule of inference select

104
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:20,250
some data to which you will apply it to and

105
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,509
.add some new formula to your database. You
keep doing this repeatedly till you have

106
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:38,319
proved the in formula that you are interested
in essentially. So, another rule of inference

107
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:51,260
is for example, Modustollans, which says that
if you have not beta and alpha implies beta

108
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:59,379
then you can add not alpha in this set I will
show.

109
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:10,009
You are familiar with this kind of formulas,
so the next question I want to ask is what

110
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:16,169
makes a rule of inference a suitable rule
of inference essentially. So, if you recall

111
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:25,379
we had
this notions of soundness we say that a logical

112
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:49,159
system is sound which says that if s 

113
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:55,429
in
other words if you can derive a formula alpha

114
00:13:55,429 --> 00:14:03,599
from a given set of sentences then if their
logic system is sound. Then, this alpha will

115
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:13,259
also be entail by the set of sentence s which
can be re express as the following if your

116
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:18,970
set of premises are true then the conclusion
will necessarily be true that is the notion

117
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,560
of entailment.
Thus, the right hand side this notion of entailment

118
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:31,259
we say that the rule of a logic system
is sound if anything that can be derive is

119
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:40,149
entailed as well. On the other hand, a logical
system is complete if anything that is entailed

120
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:49,789
can be derived observe this also look likes
sentences in a logic. This is a slightly different

121
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:56,870
logic in which we can talk about
sentences like s derives alpha or s entails

122
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,769
alpha which of course has to be in some
different logic essentially, not in proportional

123
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:12,939
logic. So, the question we want to ask is
when the rule of inference is sound essentially,

124
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:37,500
so soundness is tide up to valid rule, so
rule is valid if it entails right hand side.

125
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,360
So, rule like this is valid if this and this
actually entail beta, so look at an example

126
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,220
of a
rule which is not valid if I say alpha implies

127
00:15:50,220 --> 00:16:00,090
beta and beta, I am just writing in the old
which is its similar thing this is not really

128
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,070
a valid rule. So, we do not have a name for
it

129
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,620
this rule s says that if alpha implies beta
is given to you and beta is given to you infer

130
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,750
that alpha is true. I do not know whether
we discuss in the last class this is actually

131
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:20,840
the
process of abduction, so it is like this for

132
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:28,870
example, you might say that if somebody is
drunk then that person staggers while walking.

133
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,100
So, that could be alpha could stands for somebody
is drunk and beta will stands for

134
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,529
person stagger while walking essentially,
then you say somebody staggering while

135
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:41,250
walking essentially.
You come to the conclusion that the person

136
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:49,840
is drunk essentially, now this is not a valid
rule of inference because it possible that

137
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,470
the person may be drowsy or sleepy or tired
or

138
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:00,990
.hurt it could be anything, but it is not
necessarily follow that that. If you have

139
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,568
this fact
you assume that to be true that people who

140
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:10,298
are drunk will stagger, it does not mean that
anybody who staggers is drunk essentially,

141
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:15,709
whereas if we you were to use that formula
here if some you say that somebody is drunk.

142
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,690
If you have that somebody is people who
are drunk stagger then you can info the other

143
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:22,889
person who is stagger because the rule that
actually says that essentially.

144
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:31,209
In other example, that we might have discusses
this problem this process of diagnosis in

145
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:38,288
medical diagnosis a disease causes symptoms.
So, disease implies symptoms if you see

146
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:43,778
the symptom then you infer the disease essentially
now that is not necessarily a valid

147
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:48,009
inference. It is possible that the symptom
could have been due to some other disease

148
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,579
as
well essentially because there are many diseases

149
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,178
for example, cause fever. Then, if you
simply say that just because it is fever it

150
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:57,048
is this particular disease not a valid rule
of

151
00:17:57,048 --> 00:18:03,990
inference. So, how do we distinguish between
valid rules, and rules which are not valid

152
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:24,749
rules are based on tantological implications,
which means that corresponding to every

153
00:18:24,749 --> 00:18:30,460
rule of inference.
There must be tantology which is an imp there

154
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,500
must be an implication statement which is
a tantology and corresponding to modus phonons

155
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:53,898
for example, the tantology is alpha and
alpha implies beta implies beta. So, notice

156
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:58,398
the similarity between that pattern and this
pattern here this is one sentence one sentence

157
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:06,048
in my language of logic. There, I am using
an additional symbol which stands for derives

158
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:09,918
or something like that which is and extra
logical symbol in sense it is not a part of

159
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,210
language that I am using, but this is a sentence
in my logic and what we are saying now is

160
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,298
that rule of inference is valid. If it is
based on

161
00:19:19,298 --> 00:19:23,869
a tontological implication by this, we mean
we should we should have a corresponding

162
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:31,839
sentence here and a sentence must be a tautology.
So, is this sentence are tautology you can

163
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:34,178
construct a truth table to find out and show
that

164
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:42,030
this is tautology or you can try and show
that this is a tautology by trying to show

165
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,720
that it
is not a tautology which is kind of proof

166
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,470
that you often do proof by contradiction.
This

167
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:54,960
would say let say that can we make that sentence
false or if you remember the truth table

168
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,440
for implication you can make it false only
if you make it this part true.

169
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,659
If you make this part false now you can make
this part true only if you make this true

170
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:11,149
and
if you make this true to make this true you

171
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:16,878
have to either make alpha false or beta true,

172
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:21,808
.but if you have made alpha is true here.
So, this mean that alpha is true, so now,

173
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:25,038
alpha is
become true and beta is become false, so this

174
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:32,618
part becomes true implies false which is
actually false, once this becomes false this

175
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:37,808
and this becomes false and once this and this
become false, this becomes true. So, we can

176
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:47,128
make this sentence false sorry we cannot
make this sentence false because to make that

177
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:55,990
sentence false we have to make this part
true. We have to make this part true, but

178
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,058
we are unable to make this part true because
you have to make this true and this part false.

179
00:21:01,058 --> 00:21:07,678
That is the only row in the implication to
table where this implication formula becomes

180
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,249
false. So, this has to be false, so that means,
this beta has to be false now to make this

181
00:21:12,249 --> 00:21:17,450
whole part true this has to be true. So, to
make this part true implies false has to be

182
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,558
true,
but true implies false is not true it is false.

183
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,690
So, we are not able to make this false, so
we

184
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,600
are not able to make this whole sentence false.
So, this sentence is a tautology, so as a

185
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:30,079
small exercise, maybe you should just construct
the truth table for this and see that this

186
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,308
is
tautology. Now, there are other kinds of rule

187
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:50,058
of inference which are based on tautological
equivalences and they give rise to rules of

188
00:21:50,058 --> 00:22:03,579
substitution.
This rules of inference have a sense of direction

189
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:07,730
in the sense that you have to be given
the on the left hand side and then you can

190
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,589
produce the formula on the right hand side.
So,

191
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:17,869
it has a sense of direction you can go from
left to right essentially in rules of substitution.

192
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:24,888
You say that two formulas are logically equivalent
and therefore, you can substitute one

193
00:22:24,888 --> 00:22:30,740
for other at any point of time essentially.
So, an example of a rule of substitution is

194
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,509
and
you must be familiar with many rules like

195
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:36,200
De Morgan’s law and so on, but one rule
is for

196
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:49,909
example, alpha implies beta is equivalent
to not alpha not beta. So, you must have looked

197
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:53,179
at it at some point that if you have not done
this, tries to construct a truth table for

198
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,009
this.
You will see that this tautology and if it

199
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:01,579
is a tautology we can base a rule of substitution
on this, which means that whenever we see

200
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:07,990
a pattern of kind alpha implies beta. We can
replace it which the pattern of kind not alpha

201
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,798
or the beta and vice versa and we do not
have to replace it in the sense we do not

202
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,849
have to substitute it we can even add it,
but it

203
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:31,069
same thing. So, De Morgan’s law for example,
you must have studied, so there are many

204
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:40,808
tautological equivalences and you can convert
each of them in to rule of substitution you

205
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:45,278
can also see a rule of substitution as a bidirectional
rule of inference.

206
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:54,089
It says that this implies this and that implies
that because if you might remember you can

207
00:23:54,089 --> 00:24:08,949
.say something like alpha is to beta is equivalent
to alpha implies beta and beta implies.

208
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:17,100
So, you can think of a rule of substitution
s to rules of implies essentially going in

209
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:23,329
both
the direction essentially. So, what you have

210
00:24:23,329 --> 00:24:27,538
in your to construct a logic machine is a
set

211
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:34,908
of rules of inference a set of rules of substitution
and you have to ask is now to pick one

212
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:41,869
of this rules and keep producing new formulas
till the formula you were that looking for

213
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:49,778
is generated. So, till this formula f we are
interested is generated, so if you look if

214
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:52,269
you
remember the example we did last time we had

215
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:58,059
something like this.
It was given to us to that p and q were p

216
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:06,639
was something like allies like maps and like
music or something like that. Then, p implies

217
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:27,500
r, then r and s implies t, then not q or s
and

218
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,329
from this you have to show t that was the
problem that we looked at last time or

219
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:36,178
something very close to this. So, these are
the four premises given to us the set of

220
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:42,450
sentences s and from this we have to show
the t is derived essentially. So, we write

221
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,239
this s
as this it says that this and this and this

222
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:49,919
and this let say this is s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 then
s 1

223
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:57,629
comma s 2 comma s 3 comma s 4 and t entails
this or derives this we can only use the

224
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:03,558
truth term terms interchangeably entailment
and derivation if the logic is both sound

225
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:05,749
and
completes.

226
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:12,028
If it is sound, then whatever is derived is
true is entail if it is complete whatever

227
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,369
is entail
has been derive. So, we come to the completeness

228
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:18,388
in a moment, but so far we have
address the issue of soundness when my logic

229
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:24,229
machine sound is provided I use valid
rules of inference. Valid rules of inference

230
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,849
are characterized by the tautological
implication or tautological equivalence and

231
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:35,689
corresponding to each tautological
implication we can construct a rule of inference.

232
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,950
So, for example, if somebody says p
implies p is a tautological implication which

233
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,210
is trivially true. You can have a trivial
rule

234
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,989
for this which says that if you have p you
can add p to that essentially, but of course

235
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:51,048
that
is trivial for any tautological implication.

236
00:26:51,048 --> 00:26:55,628
You can add a rule of inference for any tautological
equivalence you can have a rule of

237
00:26:55,628 --> 00:27:03,128
substitution. So, before you move on i want
to mention one theorem, which is quite well

238
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:19,668
known. So, let me write me here its call deduction
theorem 

239
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:30,359
this theorem says that if I
have a set of sentences s and a sentence alpha

240
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:36,319
and I want to derive the sentence beta if
I

241
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,279
can do that. So, remember that this most notation
stands for this idea of generating a

242
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,358
proof that you keep apply in rules of inference
till you generate beta essentially.

243
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:56,750
.The deduction theorem says that if you can
do that then always the case that you can

244
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:05,069
do
this, you can take s to the right hand side

245
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:09,538
sorry you can take alpha to the right hand
side

246
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:19,640
and instead of deriving beta you can derive
alpha implies beta. Now, this s could be an

247
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:29,210
empty set, which means that if you want to
show that beta can be derive from alpha, then

248
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:37,220
you can equivalently show that this formula
alpha implies beta is true essentially. So,

249
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,230
in
other words if you want to show that this

250
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,019
is true, this implies this amount is showing
that

251
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:49,429
this and this and this and this implies this
if I construct the large formula then that

252
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:57,120
is true
or tautology. So, you can see that all valid

253
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:02,778
derivation amount to proving this large
tautology essentially.

254
00:29:02,778 --> 00:29:11,750
So, let me ask the question what is a relation
between these three sentences can you think

255
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:22,419
of a relation if f is valid, then if f is
satisfiable or if f is unsatisfiable is there

256
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,669
a relation
between them, we will come to this, so, just

257
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,480
think about that a little bit. So, I want
to

258
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:36,589
spend a little bit of time talking about completeness
when is a logic system complete. So,

259
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:43,369
you can see that by definition a logic machine
or a logic system is complete if it can

260
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:53,069
derive every true formula. In other words,
every formula that is entailed a given set

261
00:29:53,069 --> 00:30:00,109
of
axioms essentially and in the last a couple

262
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:07,990
of hundred years ago, there were lot of people
trying to build logic systems and show that

263
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,058
they are complete essentially.
.

264
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:22,019
So, this are known as axiomatic systems 

265
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:29,669
axiomatic system said there is set of statements
you must true to be you must accept to be

266
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:35,809
true without asking them asking about them.

267
00:30:35,808 --> 00:30:42,288
.You know just accept them to be true on faith
and some rules of inference of choice

268
00:30:42,288 --> 00:30:48,069
made is essentially. So, one of these earliest
systems, in fact probably the first one which

269
00:30:48,069 --> 00:30:56,499
is given by Frege who is also credited with
inventing first order logic was the modern

270
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:08,778
form of first order logic that we use. He
had six axioms, which were as follows this

271
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:23,108
is a
name of the axioms then one it says alpha

272
00:31:23,108 --> 00:32:05,528
implies beta implies alpha. Then, if you just
look up for Frege axiomatic system, you will

273
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:10,798
find a very nice page on Wikipedia which
describes this six axioms and the things which

274
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:35,019
we follow from there.
Essentially, you do not have to write them

275
00:32:35,019 --> 00:33:01,749
here, so 

276
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:06,729
this Frege gave this axiomatic system
which have this six axiom first axiom says

277
00:33:06,729 --> 00:33:11,700
alpha implies beta implies alpha second
axiom says alpha implies beta implies gamma.

278
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:16,288
The whole thing implies alpha implies
beta implies alpha implies gamma the third

279
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,858
one says alpha implies beta implies gamma
is

280
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:24,339
also the same as beta implies alpha implies
gamma. Then, there are three axioms says

281
00:33:24,339 --> 00:33:30,238
which use negation sign alpha implies beta
implies not beta implies not alpha. So, you

282
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:35,239
can see for example, this one Frege one has
connection with this two rules, essentially

283
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:42,509
this tool says that alpha implies beta and
if you see that not beta implies not alpha

284
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:43,509
is
implied.

285
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:47,220
Then, if you have to replace this to with
not beta, not alpha, then you have something

286
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,139
like this. So, you can see the modus Tollens
can derive using Frg one essentially and

287
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:58,769
substitute this with not beta implies not
alpha and that then it becomes like modus

288
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:04,259
ponens because not beta is given not beta
implies not alpha is given and not alpha is

289
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:15,168
given. This from many of us is trivial negation
alpha implies alpha is a axiom in Frege

290
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:23,929
system essentially and here one rule of inference
which is modus ponens, which we are

291
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:34,039
familiar with this rule here. So, Frege’s
axiomatic system says that all tautologies

292
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:41,629
of
propositional logic can be derived from this

293
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:52,369
set of axioms and this rule of inference.
So, it is a complete system because we are

294
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:54,358
not go into going to proof of this year, but
we

295
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:02,309
just take it for granted that here is a definition
of a complete logical. After Frege, there

296
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:07,230
were many people who devised different axiomatic
systems using different sets of rules

297
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:17,780
of inference and other things essentially
now as a small exercise. I will ask you to

298
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:26,769
prove
this formula using Frege’s axiomatic systems

299
00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:29,699
observe that this is not taken for granted
in

300
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:34,779
Frege system, when you say an axiomatic system.
These are the only six sentences that you

301
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,359
take for granted this are pattern, which means

302
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:43,940
.alpha can be substituted with anything essentially
and only one rule of inference allow.

303
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,990
Using this, can you come up with a derivation
of this sentence p implies p, you can try

304
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:54,239
it
a little bit while. Then, if you cannot succeed

305
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,848
you can go to the Wikipedia site and you
will find the proof there. So, I am not going

306
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,880
to do it in the board here, but you can find
a

307
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:11,960
proof essentially, but the whole idea of developing
axiomatic systems was to choose a set

308
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,000
of axioms in the given language. This is now
a case professional calculus or professional

309
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,469
logic a rule of infer some rule of inference
and say that this set which is complete, which

310
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:30,919
means all tautologies can be derived in this
including this tautology which stands for

311
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,039
this.
This implies if you look at the deduction

312
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,170
theorem that if I can show that to be a tautology
then I can this t follows from those four

313
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,900
sentences is equivalent. So, if I can show
this

314
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,289
then I can show that beta follows from alpha
essentially and Frege system can derive all

315
00:36:50,289 --> 00:36:56,269
possibilities of course that does not mean
that it is a trivial task. So, as you know

316
00:36:56,269 --> 00:36:59,139
people
have been struggling to find proof of things

317
00:36:59,139 --> 00:37:02,009
for example, Fermat’s last theorem to a
few

318
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:07,480
hundred years before it was accepted as being
solved essentially. So, finding the proof

319
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,400
is
not the trivial task it is because there is

320
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,700
a lot of choice available to you what to use
and so

321
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:20,149
on.
One of the kind of proof that we did in the

322
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,510
last class is called natural deduction which
says you take a rule of inference applied

323
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,369
to some premises and add a new one to the
set

324
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:33,860
and then again take another rule and apply
it and so on. So, we had if you remember we

325
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:41,420
had set that from this we can first derive
p and then from p and p and r we can derive

326
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:48,349
r
and then from p and q we can derive q then

327
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:54,359
from q and not q or s. We can derive s there
is a rule which I am not may be not stated.

328
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:02,579
So, from r and s, we can derive r and s and
from this we can derive t. So, there you can

329
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:09,588
start like this derive all this things then
derive t, this process is called natural deduction

330
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:10,588
essentially.

331
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,588
..

332
00:38:11,588 --> 00:38:37,259
Very often, we can generate rules of inference
by showing something like this 

333
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,339
supposing
I want to show that this is a tautology then

334
00:38:40,338 --> 00:38:52,108
one way of doing things is to assume the left
hand side. So, I assume p and q implies r

335
00:38:52,108 --> 00:39:00,480
and in some sense put it in a box, so everything
that follow within the box is based on this

336
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:08,211
assumption. Then I make another assumption
p, I open another box and third assumption

337
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:15,929
q which I open, another box and now I can
say. So, I have assume this three formulas

338
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:23,868
I have assume this I have assume this I have
assume this, now I can say p and q then I

339
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:29,880
can use p and q and this and apply modus
ponens and assume r or infer r rather.

340
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:38,950
Then, I can close this box and say I made
this assumption of q and so it is a little

341
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:43,500
bit like
this application of this deduction theorem

342
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:50,159
that I am closing this box and I am saying.
Now, q implies r because r is what I reduced

343
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:57,568
from here then I am saying I will close this
box and I will get let me write I t here p

344
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:04,358
implies q implies r. Then, finally when I
close

345
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:13,588
this box then I have this implies this, so
you see to prove this formula. So, you must

346
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:16,088
be
familiar with this kind of proof which you

347
00:40:16,088 --> 00:40:18,288
have done quite often assume that this is
a

348
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:25,940
case then show that something in this true.
So, to show that this is a tautology we said

349
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,389
let
us assume the left hand side, then we said

350
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:34,469
let us assume q, so we have three assumptions
that picked by this three boxes.

351
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:41,608
So, anything that is entailed by these assumptions
are inside the boxes, so p and q is true

352
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:46,230
inside this box because p has been assume
q has been assume and because this has been

353
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,119
.assume r can be inferred because p and q
implies r modus ponens. We can apply then

354
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,710
we
close this box we get q implies r because

355
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,949
the only assumption we made in here was q,
then we close this box then we get p implies

356
00:40:57,949 --> 00:41:03,379
q implies r because the assumption we made
was p here. Then, we close this box we get

357
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:11,920
this formula essentially, so that is another
way of another rule of inference essentially.

358
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:20,530
So, the process of finding proof is not a
straight forward process and lot of peoples

359
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:23,809
spent
a lot of time trying to devise strategy for

360
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:38,548
finding proofs. In 1965 along came a logistician
by the name of Robinson who devises the Skema,

361
00:41:38,548 --> 00:41:43,530
which you will look at in the next
class in which only one rule was of inference

362
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:51,869
was enough for driving all kind of things
essentially. Now, observe that when we talk

363
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:57,900
of axiomatic systems we are daily talking
of

364
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:04,369
proving all tautology essentially. In the
real world we are often more interested in

365
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:10,490
showing that given a set of premises that
something else is true. Before we go on to

366
00:42:10,489 --> 00:42:15,199
this
Robinsons method, there is another observation

367
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,730
that we must make which is about the
choice of connectives.

368
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:25,829
Now, if you observe this Frege system, it
uses only two connectives the implication

369
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:30,019
and
the negation essentially and yet they can

370
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:34,690
made a claim that system is complete which
means any true statement that can express

371
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:40,010
in proportional logic can be derive essentially.
So, where do the other connectives come from

372
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:46,829
well you cannot derive statements in
those exact form, but we have this rules of

373
00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:50,740
substitution essentially. So, for example,
we

374
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:55,709
have this rule of substitution which says
that not alpha or beta is equal to alpha implies

375
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:02,369
beta. So, Frege saying that not that he can
derive this form of the sentence, but then

376
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,460
equivalent form of sentence here, but logically
they are the same they are saying the

377
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:13,650
same thing essentially.
So, there is a notion of a set of connectives

378
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,230
also which is complete I am sure you are
familiar with this set. So, I am not going

379
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,750
to spent too much of time here for example,
you

380
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:30,380
must say that this set. So, Frege set this
set is complete just use the implication sign

381
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:33,530
and
the negation sign and you can express everything

382
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:37,079
can that can be expressed in
proportional logic using this connectives.

383
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,220
We have all this rules of substitution and
you

384
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:45,689
can derive everything that is a tautology
in proportional logic using this system of

385
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,880
derivation which is those six axioms plus
the modus ponens rule.

386
00:43:50,880 --> 00:44:01,190
Essentially, there are other systems which
are complete for example, a commonly used

387
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:09,039
.system is uses these three signs negation.
We will see that Robinson’s method using

388
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,360
this
set of connectives you can even just work

389
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:19,298
with and or you can even just work with or
and negation sign. There are other combination

390
00:44:19,298 --> 00:44:30,528
which are possible and some that you
must be familiar with the NAND and NOR. So,

391
00:44:30,528 --> 00:44:37,818
you must see familiar with the fact that
these two connectives NOT and AND, NOT or

392
00:44:37,818 --> 00:44:42,210
NAND and NOR. This one single
connective enough to express everything you

393
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:47,130
can express in proportional logic which
means you choose any set of connectives that

394
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,588
we have here and or implies equivalence
and so on.

395
00:44:51,588 --> 00:45:00,858
So, express anything using those connective
use can device a language in which there is

396
00:45:00,858 --> 00:45:07,098
only one connective NAND or only one connective
nor or you can express the same

397
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:14,650
thing in this logic with only one connective.
What do you mean by you can express the

398
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:20,460
same thing you mean that they are logically
equivalent which mean that any valuation

399
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:24,510
which makes any sentence true in the first
one will also make the second sentence. The

400
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:31,460
same sentence true in this in this second
formulation, in other words if alpha implies

401
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:34,318
beta
is true here not alpha or beta will be true

402
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:40,920
here or if this sentence is true, then this
sentences that is a meaning of equivalence.

403
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:48,380
So, anything that can be set in proportional
logic can be set with set of complete

404
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:57,740
sentences complete connectives and then you
can choose a set of axioms and a rule some

405
00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:01,308
rules of inference and you can have a logically
complete system. The beauty about

406
00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:05,210
Robinson system was that he did not need any
axioms he just needed one rule of

407
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:12,048
inference and that was the complete system
you could derive everything all tautologies

408
00:46:12,048 --> 00:46:21,500
in
that essentially. So, as a last thing it is

409
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,170
nice to define a complete system which is
minimal

410
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:30,889
stance in some sense small set of axiom and
small one rule of inference. As you will see

411
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:36,230
if you try to show that p implies p it involves
a lot of steps in showing that p implies see

412
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,650
because you have to start with some axiom
substitute something for there.

413
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:45,380
Then, you know keep laying with the axiom
it is a nice exercise you must try in practice

414
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:50,269
you would not want a minimal as the system
you would want a system in which

415
00:46:50,269 --> 00:46:58,009
inferences can be made very quickly. This
means you can derive sort of complex rules

416
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:03,039
of
inference, so you can say for example that

417
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:13,090
and this side in fact this is a rule of inference
that is alpha implies beta and beta implies

418
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:20,940
gamma, then alpha implies gamma, you can
have a rule of inference like this.

419
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,510
.So, you can see its like transivity and f
alpha implies beta implies gamma, then you

420
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:28,050
have
rules says that alpha implies gamma if you

421
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:34,000
have such a rule in your system then you have
to showed alpha implies gamma or something

422
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,490
like that. If somebody have given you
alpha and asked you to show gamma then you

423
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:44,300
can just take this rule here and this
conclusion here and then use modus ponens

424
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,089
can derive gamma essentially. So, it makes
sense to introduce more rules of inference

425
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:56,318
which would make you inferences shorter, so
there is some wage analogy which defining

426
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:59,849
a language here.
So, when people define the instruction sets

427
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,440
for machines, they work with more
instructions or less instructions and each

428
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,230
ahs his advantage essentially. So, theoretically
of course it is nice show that a small set

429
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:13,010
is good and complete, but in practice you
guy

430
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,520
need something bigger unless you come up with
something like Robinsons method

431
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:27,568
which was small and yet very efficient essentially.
So, we look at Robinson’s resolutions

432
00:48:27,568 --> 00:48:28,869
method in a next class essentially.

433
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:38,869
.
