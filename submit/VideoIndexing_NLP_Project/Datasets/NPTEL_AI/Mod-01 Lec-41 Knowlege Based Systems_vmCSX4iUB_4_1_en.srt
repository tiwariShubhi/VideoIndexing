1
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,679
So far in this course, we have looked at mostly
search base methods and 1 form of the

2
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,219
other. But if you look at human beings; human
beings are essentially knowledge base

3
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:31,269
creature by this I mean that we do not we
very rarely do search all we well rare rarely

4
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,109
do
tried and other unless off course you are

5
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:37,460
doing research or something which is the
different matter. But by enlarge in everyday

6
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,799
activity we look at a problem or we look at
a

7
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,469
situation and we instinctively do something.

8
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,989
And when say instinctively what I really mean
is that we already have lots of experiences

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,800
toward in our heads and we also have lot of
rules that we have acquired over a period

10
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,869
of
time. We know exactly what to do. For example,

11
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,579
if you it is raining and if you happen
caring and a umbrella you instinctively open

12
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,939
it. You do not plan and say that if you open
in umbrella and keep it over your head then

13
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:10,849
you will not get wet. In fact, you do not
even

14
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:18,089
reason about a goal saying that you have a
goal of not being wet. So, lot of time we

15
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:24,009
simply use knowledge. So, we want to now spend
the rest of the semester looking at

16
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,459
knowledge based approaches. In particular
we will look only at a specific kind of

17
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:36,920
knowledge representation which is logic base,
but let us start off with the more general

18
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,650
representation.

19
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,650
..

20
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:54,439
So, essentially you can associate the word
knowledge bit to know that you know you

21
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,109
know facts you know how to solve problems;
you know how to play tic tac to you know

22
00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:05,590
how to ride a bicycle. All kinds of things
are known to you essentially. And if a agent

23
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,680
is
to interact in a with it is world or with

24
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,939
it is surroundings in an intelligent way.
Then an

25
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,229
agent needs to represent its surroundings
create a model of its surroundings if you

26
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,560
all and
reason with that model. Not necessarily a

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,340
model which reflects how the world is around
us but some form of representation which helps

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:39,990
us solve problems. So, if we remember
that we had said that when these philosopher

29
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,460
2 three hundred years ago they were

30
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:51,379
.wondering about what is mind? What is thinking?
They said Hume and deccart 10 hobs

31
00:02:51,379 --> 00:03:11,150
they said thinking is meaningful; meaningful

32
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,260
manipulation of symbols. So, if you recall
this we are sought coming to this approach

33
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:18,870
of what we mean by thinking.

34
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,819
Off course, when we did search we also did
meaningful manipulation of symbols in the

35
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:27,350
sense that we created a represent representation
of the state space. We created the

36
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,289
representation of the move and we move sought
did some manipulation which would

37
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:36,739
take us from the start state to the goal state.
But now, we are talking in the more general

38
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:46,100
sense so manipulation of symbols also we call
the physical symbol system hypothesis

39
00:03:46,099 --> 00:03:51,329
which we had talked about in the very beginning
saimon and newel. They said the ability

40
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:58,290
to manipulate physical symbol systems is sufficiency
to create intelligent behavior and

41
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:02,780
what we meant by physical symbol systems?
So, symbol systems of first we understand

42
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,969
these are structures of symbols by physical
what they meant was that they obey some

43
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:14,169
kind of laws of reasoning. So, which is also
serve ties of a this idea of manipulation

44
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,930
of
symbols know only question that remains is

45
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,930
about meaningful.

46
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,199
We will try and get some insides into this
as we progress not necessarily today, but

47
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,569
may
be in the next week. But let us focus on the

48
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:37,930
fact that what we mean by thinking is
representation of our situation or the world

49
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,340
or the surroundings and the goals and the
desires and anything. And thinking basically

50
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,039
means manipulation of those
representations if you sought of bring it

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,699
down to simple computer science term. It
basically means we want to do some kind of

52
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:58,189
representation data structures we want to
device and wherever we have data structures

53
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:03,028
we need to have algorithms. So,
manipulation of symbols would be done by algorithms

54
00:05:03,028 --> 00:05:07,350
and in that sense the word
physical fits in there is that is that we

55
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,319
have well defined ways of manipulating symbols
which obey some laws. Essentially what is

56
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:31,550
the kind of knowledge that we carry in our
heads? So, simplest is natural language; natural

57
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,158
language is a medium for representing
knowledge and even exchanging knowledge essentially.

58
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:43,748
Of course, it is started off as a media of
a exchanging, but as people device means of

59
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:51,249
writing and printing books. It also became
a means of representing knowledge so that

60
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:56,069
somebody else could read it as a different
point of time. Why do not we use natural

61
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:03,040
language as a representation mechanism for
knowledge? The main reason has we

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,979
.probably have discussed earlier is that it
is ambiguous it is not straightforward to

63
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:13,430
understand what 1 is saying in an ambiguous
un ambiguous passion essentially. Because

64
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,478
languages is so first of all we can so say
the same thing in many different ways. And

65
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,818
secondly if you express something if you utter
something for example, if I say she

66
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:30,908
walked over towards a terminal. It is not
clear entirely what I mean by this sentence

67
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:35,139
or if
I say he went towards the bank again it is

68
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,189
not clear what I mean.

69
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:41,870
Because the words bank and words terminal
have more than 1 sense is more than 1

70
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,769
meaning essentially a terminal could be terminal
in a lab a computer terminal. It could

71
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,359
also mean a terminal in a airport essentially
so we do not know what we are talking

72
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,879
about. Likewise bank could mean a river bank
or it could mean a financial institution

73
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:06,559
this, only word which have different senses,
but other things like verbs also have

74
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:11,520
different sense. We saw an example time fly’s
like an arrow I think we had discuss it the

75
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,908
beginning of the course is a sentence which
for us seem some ambiguous. But if you

76
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:21,490
what to look at it this passionately without
the background context at we always carry

77
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,699
in
a our head it has more than 1 pass essentially.

78
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,919
And we discussed may be 1 or 2 of them
may be I would encourage you to look at them

79
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:34,990
again. But for various reasons natural
language is not attest yet a medium of knowledge

80
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:39,460
representation though even eventually
we hope that we will acquire our machines

81
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,378
with enough language processing facility.

82
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:47,889
Capability is to talk us in our languages
in English, Hindi, Tamil whatever and represent

83
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:51,968
knowledge also in those language is essentially.
Then we do not need to program in C

84
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:56,598
plus plus python ogg in our any such thing
you could simply talk to them in English that

85
00:07:56,598 --> 00:08:04,308
is way in the future we saw other mechanisms
for representation. So, I am talking about

86
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:14,590
representation here it could be an natural
language, we a seen rules already essentially

87
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:19,918
when we studied rule base systems we said
that you know you could capture heuristic

88
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,528
knowledge in the form of rules. And then use
that in fact it turned out at rule base

89
00:08:24,528 --> 00:08:30,658
systems has become like a programming language
in itself essentially. We also saw

90
00:08:30,658 --> 00:08:34,259
something similar to rules when we were talking
about planning. The planning operators

91
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:38,019
had the similar flavor about rules at there
was a well defined language in which you

92
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:43,449
could describe the preconditions. And then
an action basically linked preconditions to

93
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,660
post conditions essentially there was a well
defined language.

94
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:52,259
.So, we were moving towards move systematic
base of representing things they could be

95
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:59,100
other mechanism for representing things. We
could be have tables for example, log

96
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,790
tables I do not know how many of you have
used log tables. But when I was a student

97
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:08,059
that was the primary means of which you needed
to carry to your exams know if you

98
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,589
wanted to do some sophisticated computation
you needed a log table and something

99
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,200
called a slide rule. I do not know whether
you have heard about it but these are

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,940
representation of knowledge in some sense
essentially then he tells you that for this

101
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,550
number the logarithm is this for this number
the logarithm is this and so on essentially.

102
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:38,599
Then we have knowledge embedded in procedure
at typically and imperative program

103
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,159
contains a lot knowledge which is not explicit
essentially. You may have written a

104
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:52,329
program to create the, I to compute the Eigen
values or Eigen vectors or to find routs of

105
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,700
an equation.

106
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,060
All these programs contain knowledge which
is your knowledge which has been put into

107
00:09:58,059 --> 00:10:02,559
the program. And hence for when the program
runs basically it is executing your

108
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,989
instructions knowledge is not explicit essentially.
And I do not know whether we had

109
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:14,440
discussed is sometime but the view that was
performed by Kowalski Robert. Kowalski;

110
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,270
he use to teach in imperial college London
1970s, he was the invent of 1 of the inventors

111
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:28,699
of the programming language. The idea of logic
program he said that a program is equal

112
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:39,580
to logic plus control 
that the program compute a program has 2 components.

113
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,500
1 is what
you might call as business logic or the domain

114
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,799
logic or the problem solving strategy. And
the other is control essentially what statements

115
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,939
to execute in a program essentially and
the view in an logic programming community

116
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:01,620
is that control should be left to a system
in

117
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,970
our case and inference engine.

118
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:10,490
So, prolog will basically as you will see
rather basically does depth first search over

119
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,820
a
representation, but we have seen a variation

120
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,690
which is system which is the forward
chaining system where you write rules and

121
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,180
everything that you want to says express in
the form of rules. So, we can associate logic

122
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:33,389
with rules and control with an inference
engine. So, we this we study the rate algorithm

123
00:11:33,389 --> 00:11:39,279
for representing representation of rules
and then we saw the match resolve execute

124
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,879
cycle which forward chaining the essentially.
So, that is separating out the so the control

125
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:51,370
is left to the inference engine you only
provide the logic essentially. But very often

126
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,450
in our imperative program C programs

127
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,340
.specially whatever you do is embedded inside
procedure that is another form knowledge

128
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,810
representation when you talk about knowing
how to swim or knowing how to ride a

129
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:13,439
bicycle. It is almost impossible for you to
articulate that knowledge how do you ride

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,430
a
bicycle you cannot explain, explain it so

131
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:21,059
easily so it is sought of embedded into some
procedure which you have learned over a period

132
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:22,059
of time essentially.

133
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:27,799
So, we also carries us knowledge off course
then there are things like neural networks

134
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:38,439
which basically encode knowledge in form of
weights. And we had already observed that

135
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:48,280
these are sub symbolic they are representation
they are explicit representations, but a

136
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:53,110
symbol does not stand for something in a neural
networks a symbol meaning. A weight

137
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,509
basically everything in a neural networks
is we called it in terms of weight essentially.

138
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,059
A
weight basically tells you what is a connection

139
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:36,539
between 1 neuron and the, we will spend
our time in 

140
00:13:36,539 --> 00:14:04,289
the 

141
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:10,549
next in the remain the part of this course
looking at logic as a mechanism

142
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:18,599
for representation as well as vehicle for
reasoning essentially. So, whenever we do

143
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:26,639
representation what is the use? Representation
if we cannot do something with it so

144
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,259
along with representation you must have reasoning’s
essentially and logic provides a

145
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,909
very nice vehicle for doing both essentially.

146
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:43,069
So, logic is associated with on the 1 hand
with language and on the other hand with

147
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:52,550
inference, inference procedure of the capability
to doing essentially. So, before I get into

148
00:14:52,549 --> 00:15:01,799
logic I want to sought of try to create a
outline of what are the different kind of

149
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,120
logics at
people talk about essentially. 1 thing common

150
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:17,110
amongst all is that or the language of logic
talks about sentences a thief race in logic

151
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,860
is a sentence a basic entity in when you are
talking about using logic as a language representation

152
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,560
is sentence. So, essentially logics
are devised to express instances in 1 form

153
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:39,359
of the other. And what is the sentences some
sentences something which in principle is

154
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,500
true or false or can be true or false anything
which in principle can be true or false is

155
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:54,710
a sentence and logic. Various logics are device
to represent various categories of sentences

156
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,450
and then of course,, reason with them
essentially.

157
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:03,050
So, what do you mean by something which can
be true or false. If I say can you please

158
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:10,109
lend me a book now that is not a sentence
in the sense of sense of logic, because it

159
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,100
is not
something which is true or false is basically

160
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,500
a request or imperative statement in saying.

161
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,289
.Can you do something for me essentially or
it could be question mark. So question marks

162
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,240
are not sentences if I say what is your name,
it is not something which is true or false.

163
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,169
So, it not logically a sentence it cannot
be assign a truth or false value or if I say

164
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:30,870
please
give me a glass of water, it is not a sentence

165
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,810
it is a request or an imperative statement.
Those things are not sentences anything which

166
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:41,039
in principle can be assigned a truth or
false value is a sentence if I say why it

167
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,639
wins in chess or why it always wins in chess.
And

168
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,350
by this I mean when both sides play perfectly
it is a sentence I do not know whether this

169
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,170
sentences true or false, because as we discussed
when we talking about playing the chess

170
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:59,729
game tree so huge that we have no hope of
solving it at least not in the very near future.

171
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,960
So, we can make such sentences whose value
we cannot determine, but never thus they

172
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,100
had they qualify a sentence if I say the moon
is made of green cheese that is also

173
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:12,969
sentence. But in this case you sought of fairly
confidently say that it is a sentence which

174
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:21,430
is false so sentences as those things which
can be true or false essentially. Now, there

175
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,650
are
different kind of languages essentially so

176
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:30,000
the simplest kind of language treats a sentence
as 1 unit. So, if I say the earth is flat

177
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:39,150
then that is 1 unit essentially and the simplest
kind

178
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:55,390
of logic or logic language which we called
as propositional logic treats a sentence as

179
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,310
a
unit unbreak unbreakable indivisible unit

180
00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:06,230
you cannot look inside a sentence. You cannot
say that this 1 is talking about something

181
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,410
called the earth. And is talking about the
property call being flat nothing of the sought

182
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,390
it simply says this is some sentence and
typically we use.

183
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,530
And you must we familiar with this something
like a symbol to say p stands for this p

184
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:34,389
stands for the earth is flat essentially or
I can say Socrates is a man. This is a sentence

185
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,900
in
propositional logic I cannot look inside it

186
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,300
I just it is something and there off course
I

187
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:54,669
would want to assign a truth value essentially.
I can say all men are mortal this is also

188
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,660
in
propositional logic it just some sentence

189
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,330
I can simply call it q and I can simply call
this r

190
00:19:00,329 --> 00:19:06,760
or p 1 p 2 and so on and so far that the we
cannot look inside sentences. So, a logic

191
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,720
in
which you cannot look inside the sentence

192
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,769
or were a sentence is the atomic unit is called
propositional logic. And then off course,

193
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:20,099
we have logical connectives so we can say
the

194
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:25,240
earth is flat or Socrates is a man or the
earth is flat implies that Socrates is a man

195
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,808
you can
do all these kind of things. You can combined

196
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:31,879
sentences to form compound sentences we
will see the syntax and I am sure you are

197
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,380
familiar with it such logics are called

198
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,800
.propositional logic essentially.

199
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:48,549
Now, these 2 statements are well known for
anybody who have studied logic, because

200
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:57,109
they together represents some of the oldest
examples that people have been using in logic

201
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:04,819
in fact from Greek times that is why we have
the term Aristotle. Socrates and the logic

202
00:20:04,819 --> 00:20:13,169
and the reasoning part says that if you know
this or if this is true. And if you know this

203
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:17,970
and or in other words this is true we will
use the term interchangeably then you can

204
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:28,960
infer
that Socrates is mortal. So, this is the reasoning

205
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,470
party and this is what we mean by
reasoning in logic is that if you know certain

206
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:39,569
set of statements to true or you assume that
to be true or that given to be true. Then

207
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:42,629
you can infer that there are other statement
which

208
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,059
are true somebody tells with that Socrates
is a man and somebody tells you that all men

209
00:20:47,058 --> 00:20:55,519
are mortal. Then what Aristotle should was
that you should be able to infer that Socrates

210
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:01,279
is mortal essentially.

211
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:10,470
And this particular form of reasoning or this
particular loll is called a syllogism we will

212
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,120
not go too much into history of logic here,
because there is plenty to look at they, but

213
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,069
we
just keep in mind that this was there in Greek

214
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:29,710
times as well essentially. In fact, reasoning
is the motivation for which logics by maintained

215
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,600
in the first place essentially. Because
people wanted to say that we do not want to

216
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,929
argue about truth value of statement
essentially. If you know something is true

217
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:43,039
and something else in true and something else
is true we should be able to infer that something

218
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:51,490
else is true essentially. So, in that sense
logic is associated with the particular form

219
00:21:51,490 --> 00:22:09,808
of reasoning which is called deduction. And
we will come to this again, but just to get

220
00:22:09,808 --> 00:22:19,859
started by deduction we mean making
inferences which are necessarily true essentially.

221
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:28,319
So, that if the premises or the given or
the axioms are true then the conclusion man

222
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:36,240
net must necessarily be true logic is
concerned with forms of reasoning which take

223
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,058
you from true statement to more true
statements.

224
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:46,500
And they take you and it is a reliable robust
mechanism if logic if a logic machine and

225
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:53,460
we will talk about that says that this sentence
is true. Then you should be able to believe

226
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:00,308
it without any reason, but there are forms
of reason that we often do which are not

227
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:06,359
necessarily always true. So, in a experience
for example, is always captured in patterns

228
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:11,179
and conclusions. So, you see that clouds and
you say it is likely to rain essentially now

229
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,490
.off course that conclusion you can make,
but it is not necessarily true. Because you

230
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,849
do
not know what is going to happen in a that

231
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:21,269
is not a logical that is not something that
you

232
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:28,799
can did use essentially or to take a more
topical example if I say this students signature

233
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,299
is
there on my sheet. Then he is present in the

234
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,579
class know that is not a reliable conclusion
to

235
00:23:37,579 --> 00:23:46,710
make essentially these are forms of reasoning
which are not deductive essentially. And

236
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,759
we do deduction we though other forms of reasoning
all the kind we do for example,

237
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:57,029
generalization the whole machine learning
community is occupied with generalization

238
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:00,700
you look at examples from that.

239
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:06,048
You generalize essentially you look at one
leaf you look at another leaf you look at

240
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,619
the
third leaf. And then you a come to a conclusion

241
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:14,808
that all leaves are green it is a form of
inference which is not necessarily deduction

242
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:19,529
essentially or you look at a crow. And you
see that the crow can fly and you see that

243
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:24,680
the sparrow and you can see that sparrow can
fly. You see a parrot; parrot can fly and

244
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,220
you come to a conclusion that all birds can
fly

245
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:34,069
this is a form of generalization is a form
of learning you might say, but it is not infallible.

246
00:24:34,069 --> 00:24:42,460
For example, there are birds which cannot
fly penguin is cannot fly so there are other

247
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,500
forms of reasoning which we do all the time
or look at the process of diagnosis. We saw

248
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,950
recently an example of doing diagnosis by
a process of consistency checking essentially..

249
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:07,950
But we can not necessarily say that we have
concluded is the real fault, because in the

250
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:21,870
real world in the real world a fault causes
a symptom in the real world something has

251
00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:26,989
gone wrong. And therefore, we can see the
symptoms of, it has it having gone wrong,

252
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,279
but
in diagnosis we move in this other direction.

253
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:35,339
We look at a symptom and we jump to a
conclusion or we way can inference that this

254
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:41,220
is a fault essentially and these are not
necessarily correct. So, if you go back to

255
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,029
example that we looked of multiply as an
adders we could have concluded that the 1

256
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:50,829
adder was wrong or you could have
concluded that 1 multiple had gone wrong.

257
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:52,429
Any of them could have been true in fact,
we

258
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:55,960
could have even said a combination of things
could have gone wrong any of them could

259
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,410
have been true and without further investigation
we are not able to make a more

260
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,700
definitive statement.

261
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,710
Medicine is full of this kind of reasoning
you look at symptoms and you make inference

262
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:14,730
has to what has happen to you; you have fever
you have shivering in the evenings. And

263
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,710
.you jump to a conclusion that you have malaria
essentially now this is not deduction it is

264
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:27,539
not necessarily true. We are interested in
logic for deduction that statements that we

265
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:34,589
derive or produce using this logic machinery
should necessarily be true and logic is built

266
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:42,928
around that motivation essentially. Now, in
propositional logic I cannot take these 2

267
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:48,820
statements and I cannot device a mechanism
for arriving a that conclusion, because it

268
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,839
is
not so straightforward to to make the connection

269
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:59,119
for that. We will have to go to a higher
logic or a more descriptive logic which is

270
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:11,699
called as first order logic. And we will infects
spend most of our time in first order logic;

271
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,340
in first order logic we break up a sentence
into parts.

272
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:20,609
We keep the word all separately; we keep the
word men separately; we keep the word

273
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:25,479
mortal separately and the connection between
them separately. We break down the

274
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,140
sentence and represented with consequent which
we can then reason about essentially.

275
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:37,490
So, essentially what will say is that men
is men is a class of entities mortal is another

276
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:45,519
class of entities and if anything happens
to be a man then that was also be mortal.

277
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,548
And
there from that we will reason the, because

278
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:51,980
Socrate is happens to be a man then Socrates
is these reason, but to this to do this we

279
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,360
need this machinery of first order logic which
is

280
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:03,789
little bit more expressive in nature. Now,
this is a fact of logic is that the more expressive

281
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:12,918
a language you device the more complex is
the computational required to reason with

282
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,250
that essentially so computational complexity
increases with expressiveness.

283
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:25,710
So, some of you would have heard about good
else incompleteness theorem and what

284
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,029
that theorem says and may be will come back
to that bit later. If we get time is that

285
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,589
if
languages are expressive enough then there

286
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:44,369
are conclusions which the logical machinery
cannot make in that sense it is incomplete

287
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:47,829
essentially. So, we talk about completeness
when we have talking about search there is

288
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,179
a similar notion of completeness in logic
is

289
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:56,740
that given the fact that there true statement
out. There is my machinery able to reach the

290
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:02,190
true statement or not is the notion of completeness
and what good else showed in 1931

291
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:10,048
that reach enough languages will never allowed
completeness in. So, there is a trade of

292
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:15,690
the more reached the language the more difficult
it is do computation. And most of the

293
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:20,420
computations that we do include including
the program that we write C program will

294
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:24,400
following to the category of first order logic
essentially.

295
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,930
.And it is characterized by having variables
and being able to write lops with use

296
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:34,850
variables and things like that essentially
we will formalize that a little bit later

297
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:37,240
but there
are other kind of sentences we can talk about.

298
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,880
So, we have seen 2 forms logic
propositional logic first order logic there

299
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,030
is also, mething of called second order logic
which is what apply to we will see if we come

300
00:29:48,029 --> 00:30:04,879
to that, but what about sequence like this
if I say Nisha is tall. Now, that is the statement

301
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,240
in principle off course, I can give a truth
value to this by saying that this is true

302
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,349
this could I could say this is a true sentence
or this

303
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:19,169
is a false sentence. But the question arises
as to when can I say that this sentence is

304
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,730
true
so logic will also we concern that semantics

305
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:29,329
associate that when is this sentence true
essentially. Now, the trouble with this kind

306
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:32,329
of sentences is that if I want to device a
rule

307
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:37,740
with says if you have more than 6 feet. Then
you are tall if you have less than 6 feet

308
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,750
you
are not tall then I have this problem that

309
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:48,798
you know what is somebody's 5 feet 11 inches
or 11 and half inches would is that person

310
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:49,798
not tall.

311
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:55,609
And somebody who is just 6 feet is tall it
leads to problems when you are trying to model

312
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:59,509
real world domains. And reason with them that
if you want to talk about properties like

313
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:05,190
tall warm. Know cool what you really mean
somebody say this room is to warm

314
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,470
somebody else is feel is not to warm apart
from the part the fact that there is subjective

315
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,339
difference. There is also the notion of we
do not really know what temperature does

316
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:19,589
warm begin with. And what temperature it is
known on the so do we say that if it is more

317
00:31:19,589 --> 00:31:25,649
than 30 degree centigrade it is warm or some.
Or it is more than 35 degrees can have a

318
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:32,080
crisp boundary that is the real question essentially.
Can we divide things into warm not

319
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:38,609
warm, tall not tall by drawing a crisp boundary
and many people felt that that is not the

320
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:48,199
case that that is not what you do should do.
And one of them was lofty zeza zadeh you

321
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:58,480
must have heard about in who device this thing
call fuzzy logic 

322
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,860
so the where fuzzy logic
is difference from what we is use here.

323
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:15,139
So, these 2 are what we call as classical
logic and by classical logics we, but more

324
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:22,419
less
mean 2 valued logics sentence can take 1 of

325
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:28,740
2 value in our case we call them true and
false. But that is only for our own convenience,

326
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,730
but people have thought about multi
valued logics somebody says may be you should

327
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:39,910
have 3 values true false. And may be or
something like that or true false and do not

328
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:44,740
know maybe that is a third value people have
try to device logics like that essentially

329
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,339
what fuzzy logic. So in 2 valued logics a

330
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:56,609
.sentences either true or it is false essentially.
And that is as we will the semantic of

331
00:32:56,609 --> 00:33:04,639
sentence like this says that if you have a
mortal you either belong to the set of things

332
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,210
which are mortal. Or you do not belong to
the set of things which are mortal if you

333
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,660
belong to the set of which are mortal then
you are mortal otherwise you are not mortal.

334
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:19,190
So, that is a crisp set as we say as oppose
to that what is Zadeh said was at why do you

335
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:23,650
want to work with crisp set know you have
a notion of a set membership or the

336
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:29,309
characteristics function that you must have
defined a some point why is it mapping only

337
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:36,288
to 0 or 1 why cannot it map to 0.7 0.8 or
something like that. And zadeh said that for

338
00:33:36,288 --> 00:33:46,058
example, if I want to define tallness and
this is height then I should be able to define

339
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,418
something like this.

340
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:57,799
Whereas, some point it becomes 1, but there
are regions where you have different

341
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:04,500
amount of commitment to this belonging to
this set. So, set membership of fuzzy sets

342
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,048
so
fuzzy logic comes from fuzzy sets and classical

343
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:14,539
logic comes from crisp sets that which
either have membership is 0 1 here membership

344
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:19,699
is a continuing between 0 to 1. So, you
can if you have this height this is a membership

345
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:23,609
to the set of tall people if you have this
side this is a membership to the set of tall

346
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,760
people and it varies essentially. There are
other

347
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:50,909
kind of logic which deal with uncertainty
so for example, if I say tweedy is a bird

348
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:59,829
can I
infer that tweedy can a fly to make these

349
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:08,559
kind of inferences. And we call these inferences
defeasible inference meaning that the inference

350
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:13,989
can be defeated that you may say yes
tweety can fly, but somebody will give you

351
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:19,009
some evidence to show that tweety cannot
fly essentially. Somebody tells you tweety

352
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:22,849
is a bird and you say tweety can fly and then
somebody tell you the tweety is a penguin

353
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:24,820
then you realize that penguins cannot fly..

354
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:31,240
Then you inference defeated essentially, but
most of the time we do make inference

355
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:35,649
which can be defeated. So, we go to the canteen
and assume that I will get tea there or

356
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:45,160
canteen will be open or my bicycle will have
here all kinds of things. We believe in

357
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:49,858
which can be defeated essentially so the ability
to make defeasible inferences very

358
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:57,630
important to us, because otherwise we would
never be able to make inferences if I say

359
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:06,119
if
I use a statement that all students have bright.

360
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:09,710
Then somebody comes and shows me 1
student in some corner of the country whose

361
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,269
not bright then may statement becomes
false essentially. Because when I say all

362
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:16,119
students are bright it means that each and
every

363
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:22,210
students that each and every person whose
the student must be bright. Now, if somebody

364
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:30,579
.shows me 1 person not in Chennai off course,
who is not bright. Then my statement goes

365
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:38,509
is no longer to which means any in any inference
that I would have use making that

366
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,510
statement as a premise and know can no longer
may, because the statement is no longer

367
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,510
too.

368
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:50,150
So, if I say students in IIT go and take a
jobs in gold man sacs where in bright or

369
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,240
something like that the ability to make to
ability to reason with statements in which

370
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:59,669
you
do not have complete belief of which there

371
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,480
is uncertainty. And then reason with them
is

372
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,719
very important for us we use it all the time
and we must develop mechanisms to that.

373
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,009
And some of the things that off course we
will not studied in this course a things like

374
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:22,170
default logics and default reasoning essentially.
Then we make other kind of statements

375
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:33,329
which so we may want to make a statement this
kind that may be let say we are sitting in

376
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:41,210
this room. And we here some sounds and then
we make an inference we make a

377
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,030
statements that it is raining essentially.
Off course do not know whether it is raining

378
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,030
or
not.

379
00:37:46,030 --> 00:38:00,780
But we can make a statement that it is possibly
raining 

380
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,280
what is a what you mean by truth
values of sub sentences, how would you valuated

381
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,480
truth value of such a sentence. If I say
it is raining you can go out and look at outside

382
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,260
window and say that the statement is true
or statement is false. But what about statement

383
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,790
like it is possibly raining essentially or
if

384
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:30,779
you say that may be he is sleeping in his
room essentially. So, off course, you can

385
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,910
in this
particular case you can go and check with

386
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,589
the person is sleeping in his room. And then
you can have new statement which says he is

387
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:41,260
sleeping in his room, but what can you say
about the statement may be he is sleeping

388
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,540
in his room is that the true statement or
a false

389
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:52,650
statement. Now, people have tried to device
logics well I do not know what you mean

390
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,099
when you say true statement so you have to
be a bit careful essentially when you say

391
00:38:58,099 --> 00:38:59,670
it is
a true statement.

392
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:07,280
Then what one should say is that there a possible
world, so if you assuming that

393
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,800
everything that you do not know you we have
only a about the knowledge about the

394
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,050
world essentially. Then if there is a possible
world or a feasible world or a consistent

395
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,340
world in which that statement were to be true
then we can accept such a statement to be

396
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:31,640
true essentially. So, it is a little bit not
easy to discuss right now, but we have this

397
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:32,639
that it

398
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:42,929
.is possibly true or it is necessarily true.
So, in fact there is a whole logic which is

399
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,480
devised
to talk about statements of necessity and

400
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,550
possibility essentially. So, for example,
you

401
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:58,430
might say in that diagnosis that it is possible
that he has malaria essentially and these

402
00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:09,319
logics which are called modal logics allow
1 to talk about statements like this essentially.

403
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:20,580
So, we have something called modal operators
and there are in particular 2 operators,

404
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:29,860
one is called diamond operator this is standard
usage in modal logic community. And the

405
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:40,059
other is called a box operator and if you
write a statement in diamond p it basically

406
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,838
means that p is some statement like this.
For example, the earth is flat if I say diamond

407
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:47,858
p
it means is possible that the earth is flat

408
00:40:47,858 --> 00:40:55,579
essentially. So, I have a language for expressing
this essentially and then they have mechanism

409
00:40:55,579 --> 00:41:00,369
of reasoning which such statement
essentially. One particular kind of modal

410
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:11,010
logics is temporal logics where the temporal
off

411
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:19,710
course deals with time and when you deal with
time and you are talking about the future.

412
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,920
Now, you know that not all the time we can
make definitive statement. So, if the world

413
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,490
is
if the sky cloudy then you can say it will

414
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:34,189
possible easy in essentially in the future.
But

415
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:45,039
temporal logics are even more tied to time
you we can make statements like if you leave

416
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,139
a block of ice on you table.

417
00:41:49,139 --> 00:41:56,338
You can make a statement that it will eventually
meat essentially that there will be

418
00:41:56,338 --> 00:42:00,019
sometime in the future when the block of ice
will no longer be there and till meal

419
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:04,369
essentially. So, we can reason about time
essentially or time in change and things like

420
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:09,869
that essentially so you can say that if you
keep within proxy then eventually you will

421
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:16,160
get
a w grade essentially. Of course, not today

422
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:25,618
now another kind of log temporal logics deal
with statements like the following that John

423
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:48,450
knows something so John knows that the
earth is round. Now, look at this statement

424
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:51,879
this sentence contains a sentence so that
is the

425
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:57,599
first thing you should observed that there
is a sentence inside this the earth is round

426
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,039
and
well I had p here. So, let us call this P

427
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:11,880
1 now what I am saying in this sentence is
that

428
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:31,369
John knows p 1 essentially. So, such logics
are called epistemic logics 

429
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:34,269
and I would
basically represent this statement in a simple

430
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:41,079
epistemic logic as saying that k j were k
j is

431
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,529
the modal operator which says the John knows
something.

432
00:43:46,530 --> 00:44:00,769
And then that sentence p 1 so when can now
talk about someone knowing something’s,

433
00:44:00,769 --> 00:44:16,579
but one can also talk about statements like
this that 

434
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,569
this is another sentence in this

435
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:27,450
.epistemic logics. And let say m stands for
marry what this sentence is saying is that

436
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:32,829
Mary
knows that John knows that the earth is round.

437
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:36,019
And off course, you can I have all kinds
of thing you can say Mary knows that John

438
00:44:36,019 --> 00:44:42,579
does not know that peter has gone home or
all kind of statement. So, you can combine

439
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:50,630
logical operators which I am not seen so far,
but we will see them in due course. So, what

440
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:57,069
modal operators at modal logics are doing
is that they are taking some standard logic

441
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,289
and in our case is propositional logic that
we

442
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:02,900
are talking about then applying modal operators.
So, these are modal operators which

443
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:09,550
talk about necessity and possibilities possible
that Mary loves John if I want to say then

444
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,990
I
could use a diamond operator essentially.

445
00:45:12,989 --> 00:45:21,549
And or I could use a know this operator temporal
logics use modal operators which talk

446
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:28,630
about time epistemic logics use modal operators
which augment a language by talking

447
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:37,970
about what people know essentially. Now, almost
similar to knows is the notion of belief

448
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:43,559
so people have built logics which talk about
belief essentially what is the difference

449
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:48,259
between knowing and believing? Well, we would
like to say that if you know something

450
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:53,170
it is necessarily true if you believe something
it may not necessarily be true. So, I can

451
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,059
say
peter believes at the earth is flat essentially

452
00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:00,860
that is the perfectly valid true statement,
because that is what peter believes essentially.

453
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:05,430
The earth may not be flat, but the
statement is the true statement essentially

454
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,809
so belief so knowledge and belief.

455
00:46:07,809 --> 00:46:14,981
Off course, it is quite an interesting thing
to work with specially when you are talking

456
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:20,969
about multi agent scenario essentially. In
fact, epistemic logics were created to handle

457
00:46:20,969 --> 00:46:25,649
multi agent situations if we have know many
agents if you have networks of agents and

458
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,480
they are doing certain things. Then how can
we reason about it how can we show form

459
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,300
example that given a certain protocol. A group
people will always elect a leader or not

460
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,150
elect a leader a would be unable to elect
a leader. How can you prove such thing

461
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:46,720
essentially this what people with epistemic
logics have been associated with possibility

462
00:46:46,719 --> 00:47:00,989
and necessity is a mathematical foundation
called rough sets. So, just like fuzzy sets

463
00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:07,849
form a basis for fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets
are sets in which membership can vary to

464
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:15,349
degrees rough sets are sets which have basically
2 boundaries essentially.

465
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:16,349
..

466
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:23,429
So, for example, if I say I am talking about
the set of tall people then I could draw 1

467
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:30,649
boundary here. And another boundary here and
the meaning of this is that anybody

468
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:38,849
inside anything inside the any circle is definitely
tall necessarily tall. And anything inside

469
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:45,430
the outer circle, but outside the inner circle
is possibly tall but not necessarily tall

470
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,799
and
anything outside both the circle is not tall

471
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,349
essentially. So, rough set is a mechanism
which has been device to deal with this kind

472
00:47:53,349 --> 00:48:01,970
of a uncertainty essentially now the last
form of reasoning that it not so much like

473
00:48:01,969 --> 00:48:13,659
logic. But we have probabilistic reasoning
so

474
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:22,500
probabilistic reasoning is one way of handling
uncertainty essentially. So, for example,

475
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:33,079
when you are doing diagnosis for example,
you might device a system with says if

476
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:43,740
somebody has some symptoms. And somebody has
yellow eyes then its lightly that the

477
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:49,419
person has jaundice how do you express his
lightly look us one thing is this possibility,

478
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:57,980
but if you want to now talk about gathering
evidence and increasing your belief in

479
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:58,980
something.

480
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:03,440
So, you believe that that this is the really
the case you may be you do one more test and

481
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:11,070
you belief increases probabilistic reasoning
is 1 mechanism for handling uncertain logic

482
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:20,440
knowledge essentially. Now, you must distinguish
between fuzzy logic which also is

483
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,338
talking about numbers which are less than
1 and probabilistic reasoning which says my

484
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:31,730
conclusion. I am 70 percent sure of my conclusion
or something like that there is a

485
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:37,750
.difference between this and fuzzy reasoning
in fuzzy reasoning. It is a question of it

486
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,510
is a
linguistic problem really as what do you mean

487
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:45,130
by the world tall? Word tall essentially,
because it is not defined clearly whereas,

488
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,789
in probabilistic reasoning if you say that
the

489
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:59,210
chances that he has jaundices 0.7 or the probability
is 0.7. Then you are saying that this

490
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:04,769
is way of talking about my lack of knowledge
about the real situation. So, off course you

491
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:11,980
know that you know when you throughout diceyou
say the chance of it falling 1 or 2 is 1

492
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,780
by 3 is simply says that.

493
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,930
Because I cannot say what it what is going
to fall I just use probability as mechanism

494
00:50:18,929 --> 00:50:23,659
for
expressing my lack knowledge about what is

495
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:30,279
what really is the cases essentially. If you
had perfect knowledge about physics and all

496
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,570
the information that is needed to do the
calculations of what is really going to happen

497
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,769
when you through a dice then between the
moment when you through it. And the moment

498
00:50:39,769 --> 00:50:44,119
when it really falls you should be able to
compute in principle whether it will fall

499
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:47,010
with 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. But off course,
we do

500
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,510
not have that knowledge we do not have the
computation ability. So, we say talk about

501
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,339
probabilities it is likely that it that it
will fall like this certain likely it will

502
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:59,809
fall like this
essentially if you get time we will look at

503
00:50:59,809 --> 00:51:02,139
a variation of probabilistic reasoning in
the

504
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:07,828
context of diagnosis and see that when you
get multiple pieces of evidence. How do you

505
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:14,349
combined those evidence to maintain a different
amount of belief in all kind of things

506
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:17,519
that will be towards a end if we get time.

507
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:25,509
In the next class, we will look at propositional
logic more formally in fact, when we talk

508
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:33,770
of logic we always use the term formal logic,
because logic is concerned with form and

509
00:51:33,769 --> 00:51:42,449
not with content essentially. Logic is concerned
with valid forms of reasoning and it does

510
00:51:42,449 --> 00:51:48,500
it is not concerned with what you are talking
about. So, I can say that Socrates is a man

511
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:54,300
and all men are mortal the syllogism allowed
be to complete to conclude. Socrates is

512
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:00,800
mortal if I say Ramesh is a student all students
are bright then the same form of

513
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:07,850
reasoning will allow me to infer that Ramesh
is bright essentially. And why is that a form

514
00:52:07,849 --> 00:52:11,469
why is that a valid conclusion, because the
form of reasoning that I am using which

515
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:19,119
called as a syllogism he showed to be valid
form of reasoning. So, we will look at valid

516
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:27,769
forms of reason that we will use in propositional
logic and try to show why they are valid

517
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:33,639
also in the. So, will start off with the language
and then we look at the mechanism for

518
00:52:33,639 --> 00:52:38,539
reasoning and this whole thing we will called
as a machinery of logic. So, we will in the

519
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:45,210
.next class try an build a small machinery
for propositional logic essentially. And then

520
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,490
the
rest of the course will spend on first order

521
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:49,479
logic essentially, because that is really
interest

522
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:52,130
more interesting essentially. So, I will stop
here I think.

523
00:52:52,130 --> 00:53:02,130
.
