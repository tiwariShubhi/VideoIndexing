1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,840
let look at a 2nd example where big data can have a big impact on saving lives 

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,428
i mean literally saving lives one life at a time 

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:14,508
i collaborated with a number of world - class researchers in san diego and

4
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:18,911
an industrial group who are dedicated to improving human health through research

5
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:20,970
and practice of precision medicine 

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,250
what is precision medicine 

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,950
it is an emerging area of medicine targeted toward an individual person 

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,910
analysing her genetics her environment her daily activities so

9
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,880
that one can detect or predict a health problem early 

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,570
help prevent disease and in case of illness provide the right drug

11
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,690
at the right dose that is suitable just for her 

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,587
very recently the white house and the national institute of health here

13
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:56,401
in the american have declared it to be a top priority area for research and

14
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,779
development for the next decade 

15
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,689
the expected learning outcome of this video is for

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,668
you to give example of sensor organizational and

17
00:01:04,668 --> 00:01:07,870
people - generated data used in precision medicine 

18
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,650
and explain why the integration of different kinds of data is critical

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,940
in advancing healthcare 

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:20,000
for any technology to succeed in real life we need

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,940
not only a certain level of maturity of the technology itself but a number of

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:30,050
enabling factors including social economic environment market demands 

23
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,860
consumer readiness cost effectiveness all of which must work together 

24
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,790
why is big data for precision medicine important now 

25
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,290
let see 

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,900
an important aspect of precision medicine is to utilize

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,570
an individual genetic profile for his or her own diagnoses and treatment 

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,630
analyzing the human genome 

29
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,670
which holds the key to human health is rapidly becoming more affordable 

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,110
today cost to sequence a genome is less

31
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,760
than 10 of what it cost just back in 2008 

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:09,070
but human genomic data is big 

33
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,390
how big 

34
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,660
in a perfect world just the three billion letters of your genome

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,220
would require about 700 megabytes to store 

36
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,280
in the real world meaning the kind of data generated from genome sequencing

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,540
machines we need 200gb to store a genome 

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,700
and it takes now about a day to sequence a genome 

39
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,520
we are finally beginning to create more electronic records that can be stored and

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,130
manipulated in digital media 

41
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,180
most doctors offices and hospitals now use electronic health record systems

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,130
which contain all details of a patient visit and lab test 

43
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,290
how big is this data 

44
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:57,710
as a quick example the samaritan medical center watertown new york at 294 that

45
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:03,690
community hospital reported 120 terabytes as of 2013 

46
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,490
the data value more than double in just the last two years 

47
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,860
so clearly just in a past two years dramatic changes have prepared the health

48
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,920
care industry to produce and analyze larger mounts of complex patient data 

49
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,570
to summarize what we have seen so far the key components of these changes are : 

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,460
reduced cost of data generation and analysis increased availability of cheap

51
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,430
large data storage and they increased digitization of previously paper records 

52
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,560
but we need one more capability to advance toward the promised land of individualized

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,410
health care practices 

54
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,420
we need to combine various types of data produce by different groups in

55
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,130
a meaningful way 

56
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,150
let look at this issue from the same point of view as ilka did 

57
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,760
with her discussion of how big data can help with wildfire analytics 

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,980
the key is the integration of multiple types of data sources 

59
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,130
data from sensors organizations and people 

60
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,200
in the next few slides we look at each of these and

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,820
then i will share a story about some of the new and really exciting ways people data

62
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,660
especially has the potential to change healthcare big data landscape 

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
let start with sensor data 

64
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,000
sure digital hospital equipment have been producing sensor data for

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,720
years but it was unlikely that the data was ever stored or

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,790
shared let alone analyzed retrospectively 

67
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,025
these were intended for

68
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:45,880
real - time use to inform healthcare professionals and then got discarded 

69
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,320
now we have many more sensors and deployment 

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,850
and many more places that are capturing and

71
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,970
explicitly gathering information to be stored and analyzed 

72
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,970
let just take a new kind of data

73
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,720
that increasingly becoming common in our daily lives 

74
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,600
fitness devices are everywhere now

75
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,320
their sales have skyrocketed in the last few years 

76
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,360
they are in wristbands watches shoes and vests directly communicating with your

77
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,160
personal mobile device tracking several activity variables like blood pressure 

78
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,080
different types of activities blood glucose levels etc at every moment 

79
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,850
their goal is to improve wellness 

80
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,080
by having you monitor your daily status and

81
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,410
hopefully improve your lifestyle to stay healthy 

82
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,080
but the data they generate can be very useful medical information

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,100
because this data is about what happens in your normal life and

84
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,700
not just when you go to the doctor 

85
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,660
how much data do they generate 

86
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,890
the device called fitbit can produce several gigabytes a day 

87
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,900
could this data be used to save healthcare costs effect a healthier lifestyle 

88
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,660
that a question mark 

89
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,660
it safe to guess that this data alone would not drive the dream of

90
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,350
precision medicine 

91
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,290
but what if we consider integrating it with other sources of data

92
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:14,060
like electronic health records or a genomic profile 

93
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,310
this remains an open question 

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,460
this is an open arena for research that my colleagues at scripts are doing 

95
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,090
it also a potentially significant area for product and business development 

96
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,480
let look at some examples of health related data being generated by

97
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,120
organizations 

98
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,380
many public databases including those curated and

99
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,690
managed by ncbi the national center for biotechnology information 

100
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,180
had been created to capture the basic scientific data and knowledge for

101
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,090
humans and other model organisms at the different building blocks of life 

102
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:53,220
these databases carry both experimental and computed data that are necessary to

103
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,193
observations for unconquered diseases like cancer 

104
00:06:56,193 --> 00:07:00,730
in addition many have created knoweledge - bases

105
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,500
like the geneontology and the unified medical language system

106
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,050
to assemble human knowledge in a machine processable form 

107
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,660
these are just a few examples of organizational data sources and

108
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,040
governmental data gathered by health care systems around the world

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,050
could also be used as a massive source of information 

110
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,210
but really some of the most interesting and

111
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,040
novel opportunities seem likely to come from the area of people generated data 

112
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,450
mobile healths apps is an area that is growing significantly 

113
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,720
there are apps now to monitor heart rates blood pressure and

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,310
test oxygen saturation levels 

115
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,630
apps we might say record data from sensors but

116
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,040
are also obviously generated from people 

117
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,160
but there is more people generated data that interesting beyond censure

118
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,120
measurements 

119
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,280
in 2015 the webby people voice award

120
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,310
went to an app which supports meditation and mindfulness 

121
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,400
rather than an electronic sensing device 

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,259
a human would indicate how many minutes per day they spent meditating 

123
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,078
if they interact with the app which reminds them to be mindful 

124
00:08:11,078 --> 00:08:15,630
then we have human generated behavior that we could not get from a sensor 

125
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,510
there are well over 100 000 health apps today in either itunes or google play 

126
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,710
and by some estimates the mobile health app market

127
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,064
may be worth 27 billion dollars by 2017 

128
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,500
so really we are just seen the beginning of what data might be generated here

129
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:41,490
from what is being called human sensors but to really understand where the power

130
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,980
of people generated data might take us in the era of big data for healthcare 

131
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,360
let imagine how things stand now 

132
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,660
in general a patient goes to see their doctor and

133
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:55,960
maybe their doctor asks if they have had any side effects from their medications 

134
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,430
the accuracy and

135
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,470
hence the quality of data patients provide in this kind of setting is very low 

136
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,170
not that it really the patients fault 

137
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,930
it might have been days or weeks ago that they experienced something 

138
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,760
they may be unsure whether something they experienced was actually a reaction

139
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,380
to then report it 

140
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,590
and there might be details about exactly when they took a medication that

141
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:20,790
are meaningful but they have forgotten it after the fact 

142
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,120
today people are self reporting reactions and experiences they are having 

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,540
we are on twitter on blog sites online support groups 

144
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,030
online data sharing services : these are sources of data that we have 

145
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,660
never had before that can be used to understand in a far more detailed and

146
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,360
personal rate the impact of drug integrations are responses to certain

147
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,430
if applications were designed to integrate doctor and

148
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,040
hospital records with information on when drugs were taken and

149
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,000
then to further mine social media or collect self reports from patients 

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,230
who knows what kinds of questions we will be able to answer 

151
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,008
or new questions we may be able to ask 

1
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,830
where does big data come from 

2
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,720
the first thing i would like to say before talking about big data

3
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,010
is that it is not new 

4
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,600
most of the big data sources existed before but the scale we use and

5
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,020
apply them today has changed 

6
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,590
just look at this image of open link data on the internet 

7
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,740
i thought this image was so cool 

8
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,350
it shows not only there are so many sources of data but

9
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,490
they are also connected 

10
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,147
if you want to check it out yourself 

11
00:10:37,147 --> 00:10:40,408
we will give you the link at the end of this video 

12
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:45,859
big data is often boiled down to a few varieties of data generated by machines 

13
00:10:45,859 --> 00:10:49,010
people and organizations 

14
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,057
with machine generated data we refer to data generated from real time sensors in

15
00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:59,029
industrial machinery or vehicles that logs that track user behavior online 

16
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,687
environmental sensors or

17
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:04,930
personal health trackers and many other sense data resources 

18
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,560
the large hadron collider generates 40 terabytes of data

19
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,560
every second during experiments 

20
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:19,078
but human generated data we refer to the vast amount of social media data 

21
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,420
status updates tweets photos and medias 

22
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,943
with organizational generated data we refer to more traditional types of data 

23
00:11:28,943 --> 00:11:32,598
including transaction information in databases and

24
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:36,026
structured data open stored in data warehouses 

25
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:40,437
note that big data can be either structured semi - structured or

26
00:11:40,437 --> 00:11:45,390
unstructured which is a topic we will talk about more later in this course 

27
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,180
in most business use cases any single source of data on its own is not useful 

28
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,880
real value often comes from combining these streams of big data sources

29
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,210
with each other and analyzing them to generate new insights 

30
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,430
which then goes back into being big data themselves 

31
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,870
once you have such insights 

32
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,320
it then enables what we call data enabled decisions and actions 

33
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,858
let now look into these different types of big data in more detail 

1
00:12:19,081 --> 00:12:22,312
why is big data generated by machines useful 

2
00:12:46,325 --> 00:12:49,997
let go back for a second to our first example for

3
00:12:49,997 --> 00:12:52,715
machine generated big data planes 

4
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,940
what is producing all that data on the plane 

5
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,180
if you look at some of the sensors that contribute

6
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,600
to the half terabyte of data generated on a plane 

7
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,040
we will find that some of it comes from accelerometers that measure turbulence 

8
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,393
there are also sensors built into the engines for temperature pressure 

9
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:20,666
many other measurable factors to detect engine malfunctions 

10
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,487
constant real - time analysis of all the data collected provides help

11
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:29,496
monitoring and problem detection at 40 000 feet 

12
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:33,622
that approximately 12 000 meters above ground 

13
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,210
we call this type of analytical processing in - situ 

14
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,940
previously in traditional relational database management systems 

15
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,160
data was often moved to computational space for processing 

16
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,000
in big data space in - situ means bringing the computation

17
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,865
to where data is located or in this case generated 

18
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,936
a key feature of these types of real - time notifications is

19
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:09,090
that they enable real - time actions 

20
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,756
however using such a capability would require you to approach your

21
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,580
application and your work differently 

22
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,090
if you are using an activity tracker you should probably come up with a strategy

23
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,540
for how you will incorporate the usage of these useful gadgets into your lifestyle 

24
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,520
just like that if you are planning to incorporate big data driven insights into

25
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,610
your organization you need to define a new strategy and a new way of working 

26
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,184
most big data centric businesses have updated their culture to be more real - time

27
00:14:47,184 --> 00:14:52,160
action oriented refining real - time processes to handle anything from customer

28
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,080
relations and fraud detection to system monitoring and control 

29
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,150
in addition such volumes of real - time data and analytical operations that need

30
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,880
to take place requires an increased use of scalable computing systems 

31
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,870
which need to be a part of the planning for an organizational big data strategy 

32
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,580
they see affects of such changes also in scada system 

33
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,630
scada stands for supervisory control and data acquisition 

34
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,710
scada is a type of industrial control system for remote monitoring and

35
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:35,190
control of industrial processes that exists in the physical world 

36
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,020
potentially including multiple sites many types of sensors 

37
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,410
in addition to monitoring and control scada system can be used to define

38
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,390
actions for reduced waste and improved efficiency in industrial processes 

39
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:57,100
including those of manufacturing and power generation public or

40
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,820
private infrastructure processes including water treatment oil and

41
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,040
gas pipelines and electrical power transmission and

42
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,300
facility processes including buildings airports ships and space stations 

43
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,240
they can even be used in smart building applications to monitor and

44
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,910
control heating ventilation air conditioning systems like hvac 

45
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,030
access and energy consumption 

46
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,040
again the management of these processes once the trends patterns and

47
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,460
anomalies are identified in real - time needs to be decided in the big data case 

48
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,960
as a summary as the largest and fastest type of big data machine generated

49
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,690
data can uniquely enable real - time actions in many systems and processes 

50
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:58,198
however a culture shift is needed for its computing and real - time action 

1
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,630
big data generated by machines 

2
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,508
it everywhere and there a lot 

3
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:17,120
do big planes require big data 

4
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,650
absolutely ! 

5
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,770
did you know that a boeing 787 produces

6
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,450
half a terabyte of data every time it flies 

7
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,680
really almost every part of the plane updates both the flight and

8
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,990
the ground team about its status constantly 

9
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:36,530
where all this data coming from 

10
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,360
this is an example of machine - generated data coming from sensors 

11
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,730
if you look at all sources of big data 

12
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,470
machine data is the largest source of big data 

13
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,850
additionally it is very complex 

14
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,960
in general we call machines that provide some type of sensing capability smart 

15
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,760
have you ever wondered why you call your cell phone a smartphone 

16
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,790
because it gives you a way to track many things 

17
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,740
including your geolocation and connect you to other things 

18
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,716
so what makes a smart device smart smart 

19
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:20,110
generally speaking there are three main properties of smart devices

20
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,200
based on what they do with sensors and things they encapsulate 

21
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,480
they can connect to other devices or

22
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,490
networks they can execute services and collect data autonomously 

23
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,230
that means on their own they have some knowledge of the environment 

24
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,940
the widespread availability of the smart devices and their interconnectivity

25
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:51,080
led to a new term being coined the internet of things 

26
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:56,450
think of a world of smart devices at home in your car in the office 

27
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:02,110
city remote rural areas the sky even the ocean 

28
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:05,340
all connected and all generating data 

29
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,590
let look at an example of a device that has some of these things in it 

30
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,930
an activity tracker is a device or application for monitoring and

31
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:23,790
tracking fitness - related metrics such as distance walked or run 

32
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:30,670
calorie consumption and in some cases heartbeat and quality of sleep 

33
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,140
what if everyone in new york city wore an activity tracker 

34
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,350
what if everyone wore several 

35
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,300
i personally have three activity trackers that i use on a daily basis 

36
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,200
one to track my sleep another one to track my physical activity and

37
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,250
a third my smartphone that goes everywhere with me 

38
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:58,030
so it is not that unusual to imagine that this will be the case for many people 

39
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:03,320
as you have already heard from in a previous lecture on personalized data 

40
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,760
such activity trackers have enabled a new way

41
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,210
of doing patient intervention via personalized medicine 

42
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,440
similarly the sensors in planes have generated a new way of looking at

43
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,370
fleet management and flight safety 

44
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:24,055
as a summary machines collect data 24 7 via

45
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:29,980
their built - in sensors both at personal and industrial scales 

46
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,308
and thus they are the largest of all the big data sources 

1
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,963
organization - generated data 

2
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:42,580
benefits come from combining with other data types 

3
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,380
how are some organizations benefiting from big data 

4
00:21:02,278 --> 00:21:04,844
let look at real world examples to see the advantages these organizations

5
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,800
are getting out of big data 

6
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,120
one of these companies is ups 

7
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,650
ups delivers 16 million shipments per day 

8
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,360
they get around 40 million tracking requests 

9
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,900
that huge 

10
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:27,431
an estimate of how much data ups has on its operations is 16 petabytes 

11
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,580
can you guess how much money ups can save by reducing each driver route

12
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,620
by just one mile 

13
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,113
if they can reduce distance traveled by each truck by even one mile 

14
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:46,830
ups can save a whopping 50 million american per year 

15
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,010
this is where big data steps in 

16
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:55,610
utilizing complex optimization over large datasets

17
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,250
can lead to route optimizations that were previously not visible to the company 

18
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:05,900
big data together with smart processing 

19
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,720
enables ups to manage thousands of route optimizations 

20
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,310
let travel from package delivery to the retail domain 

21
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,870
an organization from the retail shopping domain

22
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,760
that heavily utilizes big data is walmart 

23
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:31,220
walmart is a big organization that gets 250 million customers in 10 000 stores 

24
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:40,570
did you know they collect 2 5 petabytes of data per hour 

25
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,699
they collect data on twitter tweets local events local weather 

26
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:52,640
in - store purchases online clicks and

27
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,530
many other sales customer and product related data 

28
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,080
they use this data to find patterns such as which products are frequently

29
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,878
purchased together and what is the best new product to introduce in their stores 

30
00:23:09,878 --> 00:23:14,530
to predict demand at the particular location 

31
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:20,898
and to customize customer recommendations 

32
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,430
overall by leveraging big data and

33
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:28,390
analytics walmart has maintained its position as a top retailer 

34
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:35,130
ups and walmart examples were just two out of a number of companies using big data 

35
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,760
big data is producing results for companies in all sectors 

36
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:47,370
studies forecast spending on big data technologies to go up

37
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,630
drastically in the next five years 

38
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,280
a study by bane and company suggests that early adopters of big

39
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:03,650
data analytics have gained a significant lead over the rest of the corporate world 

40
