1
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:06,640
the sixth v value 

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,970
in this module 

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:13,160
we described the five ways which are considered to be dimensions of big data 

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,947
each way presented a challenging dimension of big data namely 

5
00:00:19,947 --> 00:00:25,500
size complexity speed quality and connectedness 

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,850
although we can list some other rays base on the context we prefer to list these

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,490
five s fundamental dimensions that this big data specialization helps you work on 

8
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,940
however at the heart of the big data challenge

9
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,860
is turning all of the other dimensions into truly useful business value 

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,640
the idea behind processing all this big data in the first place

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,640
is to bring value to the problem at hand 

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:02,230
in week two we will explore how to take the first steps into

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,270
starting to generate value out of big data 

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:12,465
now that we saw all the ways let focus on an example of a big data challenge 

15
00:01:12,465 --> 00:01:16,940
let imagine now that you are part of a company called eglence inc 

16
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,992
one of the products of eglence inc is a highly popular mobile game

17
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:25,506
called catch the pink flamingo 

18
00:01:25,506 --> 00:01:30,046
it a multi - user game where the users have to catch special types

19
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:34,188
of pink flamingos that randomly pop up on the world map on their

20
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:38,670
screens based on the mission that gets updated randomly 

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,120
the game is played by millions of people online throughout the world 

22
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,110
one of the goals of the game is to form a network of players to collectively

23
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:52,470
cover the world map with pink flamingo sightings and compete other groups 

24
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,670
users can pick their groups based on player stats 

25
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,530
the game website sends free cool stuff to registered users 

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,483
registration requires users to enter demographic information such gender 

27
00:02:07,483 --> 00:02:12,542
year of birth city highest education and things like that 

28
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:17,675
however most of the users enter inaccurate information about themselves 

29
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:20,140
just like most of us do 

30
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,980
to help improve the game the game collects realtime usage activity

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,740
data from each player and feeds them to it data servers 

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,290
the players of this game are enthusiastically active on social media 

33
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,480
and have strong associations with the game 

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,424
a popular twitter hashtag for this game is catchthepinkflamingo 

35
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:48,780
which gets more than 200 000 mentions worldwide per day 

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,695
there are strong communities of users who meet via social media and

37
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,984
get together to play the game 

38
00:02:55,984 --> 00:03:02,960
now imagine yourself as the big data solutions architect for fun games inc 

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,640
there are definitely examples of all three types of data sources in this example 

40
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,510
the mobile app generates data for the analysis of user activity 

41
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,407
twitter conversations of players form a rich source of unstructured data from

42
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,005
people 

43
00:03:19,005 --> 00:03:20,191
and the customer and

44
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:24,250
game records are examples of data that this organization collects 

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,010
this is a challenging big data example

46
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,680
where all characteristics of big data are represented 

47
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,240
there are high volumes of player game and

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,560
twitter data which also speaks to the variety of data 

49
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,465
the data streams from the mobile app website and

50
00:03:43,465 --> 00:03:48,979
social media in real - time which can be defined as high velocity data 

51
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:53,203
the quality of demographic data users enter is not clear and

52
00:03:53,203 --> 00:03:58,334
there are networks of players which are related to the balance of big data 

1
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,918
cloud computing : an important big data enabler 

2
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:23,586
in our first lecture in this course we mentioned the cloud as one of

3
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:27,450
the two influences of the launch of the big data era 

4
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,050
we called it on - demand computing and

5
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,390
we said that it enables us to compute any time any anywhere 

6
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,110
simply whenever we demand it 

7
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,540
in this video 

8
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,260
we will see how we deploy the cloud to our benefit in our big data applications 

9
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,990
the main idea behind cloud computing

10
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,340
is to transform computing infrastructure into a commodity 

11
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,220
so application developers can focus on solving application - specific challenges

12
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,880
instead of trying to build infrastructure to run on 

13
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,760
so how does this happen 

14
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,840
we can simply define a cloud computing service 

15
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,390
as a rental service for computing 

16
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,700
you rent what you want and return upon usage 

17
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,650
think about this you would not buy or

18
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,950
even build a truck every time you have to move a piece of furniture 

19
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,880
you would simply rent 

20
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,750
why build a computing cluster when you can rent 

21
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,930
especially if you are not using it all the time 

22
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,900
similarly you can rent a car or a bike when you are on vacation 

23
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,035
so you can bike anytime anywhere 

24
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,970
let dig into this question 

25
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,240
what factors do you consider when you are developing a solution for your yourself or

26
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,800
your client 

27
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,880
should you build a hardware and software resources yourself 

28
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,090
or should you rent these resources from the cloud 

29
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,390
let look at in - house hardware and software resource building first 

30
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,975
if you choose to develop in - house capabilities you have to hire people and

31
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,630
buy hardware that suits your requirements 

32
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,750
these includes but not limited to buying networking hardware 

33
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:27,040
storage disks upgrading hardware when it becomes obsolete and so on 

34
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,360
not to forget the real estate cost of keeping the hardware 

35
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,190
how do you estimate the size of your hardware needs 

36
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,910
do you make a five year estimate or ten year 

37
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,110
in today fast changing world 

38
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,620
it is becoming harder to estimate future demands 

39
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,220
getting the software that fits your needs is equally challenging 

40
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,700
most software installations require a lot of tweaking and

41
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,030
manual intervention that require a lot of skills 

42
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,025
you will need your engineers to do this 

43
00:07:00,025 --> 00:07:03,300
compatibility issues bring problems that are hard to foresee 

44
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,750
most software is updated on a daily basis 

45
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,210
you must ensure you are updated 

46
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,870
this insures you avoid security risks and get the best 

47
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:23,770
over all building your own data center or computing power house can be expensive 

48
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,200
and it can be time consuming maintaining it is a task by itself 

49
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,760
this requires high initial capital investments and

50
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,380
efficient operation of several departments in your business 

51
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,540
which you might not have if you are a startup company 

52
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,800
most people forget to include the cost of disposing old hardware 

53
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,788
now lets see what the cloud can do for us 

54
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:53,660
cloud benefits are similar to what you would get from a rental car company 

55
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,720
you pay for what you use which means a low capital investment 

56
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,680
you do not need to go to the dealership do a negotiation get a bank loan 

57
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,420
get insurance 

58
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,680
that means quick implementation of your projects 

59
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,350
just like you do not need to buy a car if you only need a car for

60
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:20,200
a limited use deploying your application on a server that is geographically

61
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,200
closer to your client can give you fast service and happy customers 

62
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,430
for startup and small business it can be challenging to do so 

63
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,620
cloud lets you do this with a click 

64
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:40,950
you can be sitting at a coffeeshop or your home and starting your internet business 

65
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,700
without a huge capital investment thanks to the cloud 

66
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,230
and you do not need to have a five or ten year resource estimation plan 

67
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,527
adapt to your requirements faster if your business is growing faster than you

68
00:08:53,527 --> 00:08:54,130
thought 

69
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,330
cloud lets you forget about the resource management problems and

70
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,310
lets you focus on your business products or domain expertise with minimal cost 

71
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,500
just as you can rent a truck or a convertible at a rental car company 

72
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,520
you can build your own custom machine on cloud 

73
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,430
with a custom machine we mean a commodity cluster

74
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,940
made out of the right type of computing nodes for your application 

75
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,930
you pick not only a cpu or a gpu but

76
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,420
pick from a whole menu of compute memory and storage choices 

77
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,590
it a buffet on the cloud 

78
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:37,900
design machines to suit your application requirements data size and analytics 

79
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,740
get what you want and pay for what you use 

80
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,380
compare this with buying and

81
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,980
maintaining all combinations of hardware that you possibly would use 

82
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,860
that is so costly and not possible at all times 

83
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,710
thanks to all these advantages there are many cloud server providers today 

84
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,990
and the numbers are growing 

85
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,820
here we list some of the players in the cloud computing market 

86
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,940
take a moment to look at them 

87
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,990
you will probably recognize some big names and

88
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,730
some others you have not even heard of before 

89
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,670
as a summary cloud does the heavy lifting so your team can extract

90
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,300
value from data with getting bogged down in the infrastructure details 

91
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,680
cloud provides convenient and

92
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,485
viable solutions for scaling your prototype to a full fledged application 

93
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:41,400
you can leverage the experts to handle security 

94
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,450
robustness and let them handle the technical issues 

95
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,560
your team can work on utilizing your strengths

96
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,320
to solve your domain specific problem 

1
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,528
cloud service models : exploration of choices 

2
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:16,709
there are many levels of services that you can get from cloud providers 

3
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,880
any cloud computing discussion will involve terms like application

4
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,800
as a service platform as a service and infrastructure as a service 

5
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,660
all of these refer to business models around using the cloud

6
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,460
with different levels of engagement and servicing similar to rental agreements 

7
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,470
iaas infrastructure as a service can be defined as a bare minimum rental service 

8
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,630
this is like renting a truck from a company that you can assume has hardware

9
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,978
and you do the packing of your furniture and drive to your new house 

10
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:07,430
you as the user of the service install and maintain an operating system 

11
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,400
and other applications in the infrastructure as a service model 

12
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,180
the amazon ec2 cloud is a good example for this model 

13
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,940
paas platform as a service 

14
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,840
is the model where a user is provided with an entire computing platform 

15
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,130
this could include the operating system and programming languages that you need 

16
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,440
it could extend to include the database of your choice or even a web server 

17
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
you can develop and

18
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,150
run your own application software on top of these layers 

19
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,510
the google app engine and microsoft azure are two examples of this model 

20
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,770
saas the software as a service model is the model

21
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,090
in which the cloud service provider takes the responsibilities for the hardware and

22
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,710
software environment such as the operating system and the application software 

23
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,720
this means you can work on using the application to solve your problem 

24
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,848
dropbox is a very popular software as a service platform 

25
00:13:26,638 --> 00:13:31,205
ultimately the decision of which service you want to explore is a function of

26
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:32,460
several variables 

27
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,760
it depends on the skill level of your team to handle computing environment 

28
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,080
development and maintenance 

29
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,010
it also depends on how you might need to use the service 

30
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,990
you need to pick the right service model that

31
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,520
best fits you in terms of long term goals 

32
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:56,610
finally when you are deploying a cloud service you also have to understand

33
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,480
all the security risks since your data resides on third party service 

34
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,026
security is a very important aspect in today world of growing

35
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:10,207
digitization of information 

36
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:13,990
you must make your client data safety a top priority 

37
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,859
and hence this should be an important criteria in your decision 

38
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,870
all the security risks must be understood and

39
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,000
evaluated as your data resides on third party servers 

40
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,370
we are seeing other forms of services being added

41
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,080
to the family of cloud services 

42
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,710
the logic of infrastructure platform and

43
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,550
software as a service is getting extended further 

44
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,580
xaas is an umbrella term that signifies

45
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,980
even finer - grain control over computing resources that you want to rent 

46
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,520
for example storage as a service communication as a service 

47
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,410
marketing as a service and so on 

48
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:06,370
as a summary infrastructure as a service platform as a service and application

49
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,800
as a service are three main class service models that are being used with success 

50
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,788
picking one will depend on the number of variables which are company goals 

51
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:20,840
these three models have inspired many similar models

52
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,880
to emerge around cloud computing 

1
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,331
in this lecture we will be learning about the basic file manipulation commands for

2
00:15:26,331 --> 00:15:27,953
the hadoop file system or hdfs 

3
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:31,440
we will first start by downloading a text file of words 

4
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,040
we will use this text file to copy to and from the local file system in hdfs and

5
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,730
later on we will use it to run word count on 

6
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,960
after we download the text file we will open a terminal shell and

7
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,220
copy the text file from the local file system to hdfs 

8
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:51,870
next we will copy the file within hdfs and

9
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,880
also see how to copy file from hdfs to the local file system 

10
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,223
finally we will see how to delete a file in hdfs 

11
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:01,410
let start 

12
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,390
we are going to download text file to copy into hdfs 

13
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,610
it does not matter what the contents of the text file is so we will download

14
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,380
the complete works of shakespeare since it contains interesting text 

15
00:16:15,343 --> 00:16:18,840
first click on the icon here to launch a web browser 

16
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,780
now we will search google for the complete works of shakespeare 

17
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:41,880
i am going to be using this first link here 

18
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,500
and we will provide this link in the reading section 

19
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,080
so this is the complete works of shakespeare and

20
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,700
we will save it to a text file in the local file system by clicking on the icon here 

21
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,790
the open menu and selecting save page 

22
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,105
so we will call it words txt 

23
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:14,090
and the save in folder it going to save it into the downloads directory 

24
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:24,800
once that completes we will open a terminal window by clicking on the icon here 

25
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:35,480
so if we go into the downloads ddrectory by typing a cd downloads and

26
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:43,320
running ls we can see that words txt was successfully downloaded 

27
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,100
moving on let copy words txt from the local file system to the hdfs file system 

28
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:00,711
the command to do this is hadoop fs - copyfromlocal words txt 

29
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,330
when i run this it will copy it from the local directory and

30
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,595
local file system to hdfs 

31
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:14,681
we can see that the file was copied by running hadoop fs - ls 

32
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:19,630
you can see that the file was successfully copied 

33
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:27,673
next we can copy this file to another file within hdfs 

34
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:36,170
we can do this by running hadoop fs - cp words txt words2 txt 

35
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:42,500
the first words txt is the file that already exists in hdfs 

36
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,760
the second words 2 txt

37
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,230
is the new file that we are going to create when we run this command 

38
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,182
let run it and again we are can run

39
00:18:55,182 --> 00:19:00,033
hadoopfs - ls to see the files in hdfs 

40
00:19:00,033 --> 00:19:06,364
we can see the original file words txt and the copy that was made words2 txt 

41
00:19:08,723 --> 00:19:14,680
let copy words2 txt from hdfs to the local filesystem 

42
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:22,909
we can do this by running hadoop fs - copytolocal words2 txt 

43
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:31,210
after i run this command i can call ls to see the contents of the local file system 

44
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:38,455
so now we have the new file words2 txt which we have just copied from hdfs 

45
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,980
the last step in this lecture is to delete a file in hdfs 

46
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,881
we can delete words2 txt by running hadoop fs 

47
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:54,404
but is rn words2 txt 

48
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,930
as you can see it printed that it deleted the file 

49
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,806
we can also run hadoop fs - ls to verify that the file is deleted 

50
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:12,872
you can see that there only the original words txt and words2 txt was deleted 

1
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,260
getting started 

2
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,310
why do we worry about foundations 

3
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:31,079
starting next week you will start diving into the details of the hadoop

4
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:33,650
framework for big data 

5
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,460
before you start taking a little bit of time to understand some core

6
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,580
concepts will help you to digest the information on hadoop better and faster 

7
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,670
imagine yourself attending a chemistry lab 

8
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,700
before you start hearing about the tubes and mixtures you really need

9
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,650
to understand the chemistry or theory of the practical concepts in the lab 

10
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,650
similarly learning these concepts now will help

11
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,880
you with your understanding of the practical concepts in the hadoop lectures 

12
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,290
in addition we want to prepare you to understand the tools beyond hadoop 

13
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:18,410
any big data system that you find will be built on these core concepts 

14
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,200
so these foundations will help you beyond this course 

15
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,460
now let get started
