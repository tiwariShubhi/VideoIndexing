1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:06,650
big data generated by organizations structured but often siloed 

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,930
the last type of big data we will discuss is big data generated by organizations 

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,740
this type of data is the closest to what most businesses currently have 

4
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,550
but it considered a bit out of fashion or

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,180
traditional compared to other types of big data 

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,760
however it is at least as important as other types of big data 

7
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:51,350
so how do organizations produce data 

8
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,940
the answer to how an organization generates data

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,260
is very unique to the organization and context 

10
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,540
each organization has distinct operation practices and

11
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,860
business models which result in a variety of data generation platforms 

12
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,697
for example the type and source of data that a bank gets is very different from

13
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,650
what a hardware equipment manufacturer gets 

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,808
some common types of organizational big data come from commercial transactions 

15
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:29,033
credit cards government institutions e - commerce banking or

16
00:01:29,033 --> 00:01:35,070
stock records medical records sensors transactions clicks and so on 

17
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,930
almost every event can be potentially stored 

18
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,320
organizations store this data for current and

19
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,040
future use as well as for analysis of the past 

20
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,970
let say you are an organization that collects sales transactions 

21
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,500
you can use this data for pattern recognition to detect correlated products 

22
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,990
to estimate demand for products likely to go up in sales and

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,780
capture fraudulent activity 

24
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:14,560
moreover when you know your sales record and can correlate it

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,370
with your marketing records you can find which campaigns really made an impact 

26
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,340
you are already becoming a data savvy organization 

27
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,180
now think of bringing your sales data together with other

28
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,680
external open public data such as major world events in the news 

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,420
you can ask was it savvy marketing or

30
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,310
a consequence of external events that triggered your sales 

31
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,037
using proper analytics 

32
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:50,800
you can now build inventories to match your predicted growth and demand 

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,060
in addition organizations build and apply processes to record and

34
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,310
monitor business events of interest such as registering a customer 

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,116
manufacturing a product or taking an order 

36
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:10,930
these processes collect highly structured data

37
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,460
that include transactions reference tables and

38
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,810
relationships as well as the metadata that sets its context 

39
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,580
usually structured data is stored in relational database management systems 

40
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,805
however we call any data that is in the form of

41
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:36,708
a record located in a fixed field or file structured data 

42
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:40,300
this definition also includes spreadsheets 

43
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,490
as i have mentioned before traditionally this type of

44
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,070
highly structured data is the vast majority of what it managed and

45
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,420
processed in both operational and business intelligence systems 

46
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,410
let look at the sales transaction data in our previous example 

47
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,575
if you look at the data in the relational table on the right 

48
00:04:05,575 --> 00:04:09,687
as the name structured suggests 

49
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:14,649
the table is organized to store data using

50
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:18,493
a structure defined by a model 

51
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:24,450
each column is tagged to tell us what data that column intends to store 

52
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,950
this is what we call a data model 

53
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,680
a data model defines each of these columns and

54
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,290
fields in the table and defines relationships between them 

55
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,960
if you look at the product id column you will see that it includes only

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,940
identifiers that can potentially be linked to another table defining these products 

57
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,990
the ability to define such relationships easily make structured data 

58
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,220
or in this case relational databases highly adopted by many organizations 

59
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,330
there are commonly used languages like sql 

60
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,600
the structured query language to extract data of interest from such tables 

61
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,800
this is referred to as querying the data 

62
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,060
however it could even be a challenge to integrate such structured data 

63
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,460
this image shows us a continuum of technologies to model 

64
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,880
collect and query unstructured data coming from software and

65
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,180
hardware components within an organization 

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,150
in the past such challenges led to information being stored

67
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,050
in what we call silos even within an organization 

68
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,700
many organizations have traditionally captured data at the department level 

69
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:56,950
without proper infrastructure and policy to share and integrate this data 

70
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,550
this has hindered the growth of scalable pattern recognition

71
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,510
to the benefits of the entire organization 

72
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,700
because no one system has access to all data that the organization owns 

73
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,080
each data set is compartmentalized 

74
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,320
if such silos are left untouched organizations risk having outdated 

75
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,320
unsynchronized and even invisible data sets 

76
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,260
organizations are realizing the detrimental outcomes of this rigid

77
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,820
structure 

78
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,270
and changing policies and infrastructure to enable integrated processing of

79
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,025
all data to the entire organization benefit 

80
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:44,090
cloud - based solutions are seen as agile and

81
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,550
low capital intensive solutions in this area 

82
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,309
as a summary while highly structured organizational data is very useful and

83
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,671
trustworthy and thus a valuable source of information 

84
00:06:57,671 --> 00:07:01,860
organizations must pay special attention to breaking up

85
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,243
the silos of information to make full use of its potential 

1
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,542
the key integrating diverse data 

2
00:07:19,178 --> 00:07:22,267
whatever your big data application is and

3
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:27,527
the types of big data you are using the real value will come from integrating

4
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:32,056
different types of data sources and analyzing them at scale 

5
00:07:32,056 --> 00:07:34,947
so how do we start getting this value 

6
00:07:34,947 --> 00:07:36,706
sometimes all it takes 

7
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:41,620
is looking at the data you already collect in a different way 

8
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,060
and it can mean a big difference in your return on investment 

9
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,970
this new story from june 2015 mentions that carnival cruises

10
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,760
is using structured and unstructured data from a variety of sources 

11
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,200
carnival turns it into profit

12
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,640
using price optimization techniques on the integrated data 

13
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,460
for you to achieve such a success story 

14
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,030
you will need to include data integration into your big data practice 

15
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,950
however there are some unique challenges when attempting to integrate these

16
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,120
diverse data sources and scaling the solutions 

17
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,220
course two on on the specialization we will teach you more about these issues 

18
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,010
but let take a moment to define why effect of data integration is useful 

19
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,040
data integration means bringing together data from diverse sources and

20
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,170
turning them into coherent and more useful information 

21
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,390
we also call this knowledge 

22
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:53,970
the main objective here is taming or more technically managing data and

23
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,520
turning it into something you can make use of programmatically 

24
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,460
a data integration process involves many parts 

25
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,250
it starts with discovering accessing and monitoring data and

26
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:15,340
continues with modeling and transforming data from a variety of sources 

27
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,160
but why do we need data integration in the first place 

28
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,900
let start by focusing on differences between big data sets

29
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,140
coming from different sources 

30
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,640
you might have flat file formatted data relational database data 

31
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,470
data encoded in xml or json both common for internet generated data 

32
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:41,170
these different formats and models are useful

33
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,690
because they are designed to express different data in unique ways 

34
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,560
in a way different data formats and

35
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,100
models make big data more useful and more challenging all at the same time 

36
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,700
when you integrate data in different formats you make the final

37
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,030
product richer in the number of features you describe the data with 

38
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:09,300
for example by integrating environmental sensor and

39
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,300
camera data with geographical information system data such as in

40
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,178
my wildfire prediction application i can use the spacial data capabilities

41
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:25,970
with non - spacial data to more accurately run fire simulations 

42
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,920
in the past although we were able to see the images of the fire

43
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,630
from mountain top cameras just like this image we were still

44
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,880
not able to tell what the exact location of the fire is automatically 

45
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,000
now when a fire is detected from a mountain top camera 

46
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,640
viewsheds are used to estimate the location of the fire 

47
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,760
this location information can be fed into the fire simulator

48
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,070
as early as it detected to predict the size and

49
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,090
location of the fire in the next hour more accurately and faster 

50
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,920
similarly i can use real time data with eye curve data sets and

51
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,940
use them all together 

52
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,520
additionally by bringing the data together and

53
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,100
providing programmable access to it i am now making each data set more accessible 

54
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,020
moreover integration of diverse datasets significantly

55
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,220
reduces the overall data complexity in my data - driven product 

56
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,610
the data becomes more available for use and unified as a system of its own 

57
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,010
one advantage of such an integration is not often mentioned 

58
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,830
such a streamlined and integrated data system

59
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:59,550
can increase the collaboration between different parts of your data systems 

60
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,430
each part can now clearly see

61
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,000
how their data is integrated into the overall system 

62
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,860
including the user scenarios and the security and privacy processes around it 

63
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:22,320
overall by integrating diverse data streams you add value to your big data and

64
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,320
improve your business even before you start analyzing it 

65
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,783
next we will focus on the dimensions of the scalability and

66
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:35,937
discuss how we can start tackling some of these challenges 

1
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,380
what launched the big data era 

2
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,092
in this video you will learn about two new opportunities that have

3
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:47,088
contributed to the launch of the big data era 

4
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:07,070
opportunities are often a signal of changing times 

5
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,100
in 2013 an influential report by a company called mckinsey claimed that

6
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,900
the area of data science will be the number one catalyst for economic growth 

7
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,320
mckinsey identified one of our new

8
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,366
opportunities that contributed to the launch of the big data era 

9
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:34,190
a growing torrent of data 

10
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:40,150
this refers to the idea that data seems to be coming continuously and at a fast rate 

11
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:46,330
think about this today you can buy a hard drive to store

12
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,624
all the music in the world for only 600 

13
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:59,600
that an amazing storage capability over any previous forms of music storage 

14
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,286
in 2010 there were 5 billion mobile phones in use 

15
00:14:04,286 --> 00:14:08,018
you can be sure that there are more today and

16
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:12,476
as i am sure you will understand these phones and

17
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:17,244
the apps we install on them are a big source of big data 

18
00:14:17,244 --> 00:14:22,342
which all the time every day contributes to our core 

19
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:25,444
and facebook which recently just set

20
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:30,144
a record of having one billion people login in a single day 

21
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:35,320
has more that 30 billion pieces of content shared every month 

22
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,620
well that number from 2013 

23
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,310
so i am sure that it much higher than that now 

24
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,950
does it make you think how many facebook share you made last month 

25
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,105
all this leads to projections of serious growth 

26
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:59,860
40 in global data per year and 5 in global it spending 

27
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,080
this much data has sure pushed the data science field

28
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,420
to start remaining itself and the business world of today 

29
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:13,970
but there something else contributing to the catalyzing power of data science 

30
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,820
it is called cloud computing 

31
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,600
we call this on demand computing 

32
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,480
cloud computing is one of the ways in which computing

33
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,220
has now become something that we ca do anytime and anywhere 

34
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,170
you may be surprised to know that some of your favorite

35
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,900
apps are from businesses being run from coffee shops 

36
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,420
this new ability combined with our torrent of data 

37
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,220
gives us the opportunity to perform novel dynamic and scalable data analysis 

38
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,824
to tell us new things about our world and ourself 

39
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:55,037
to summarize a new torrent of big data combined with computing capability

40
00:15:55,037 --> 00:16:00,968
anytime anywhere has been at the core of the launch of the big data era 

1
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,360
asking the right questions 

2
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:23,810
the first step in any process is to define what it is you are trying to tackle 

3
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,975
what is the problem that needs to be addressed or

4
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:30,240
the opportunity that needs to be ascertained 

5
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,223
without this you wo not have a clear goal in mind or

6
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,153
know when you have solved your problem 

7
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:42,833
an example question is how can sales figures and

8
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:48,072
call center logs be combined to evaluate a new product 

9
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:53,534
or in a manufacturing process how can data from multiple

10
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:59,573
sensors in an instrument be used to detect instrument failure 

11
00:16:59,573 --> 00:17:02,745
how can we understand our customers and

12
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:07,273
market better to achieve effective target marketing 

13
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:11,320
next you need to assess the situation with respect to the problem or

14
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,730
the opportunity you have defined 

15
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:20,011
this is a step where you need to exercise caution analyzing risks 

16
00:17:20,011 --> 00:17:23,609
costs benefits contingencies 

17
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:28,650
regulations resources and requirements of the situation 

18
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,910
what are the requirements of the problem 

19
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,850
what are the assumptions and constraints 

20
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:35,450
what resources are available 

21
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,614
this is in terms of both personnel and capital 

22
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:43,685
such as computer systems instruments etc 

23
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:47,425
what are the main costs associated with this project 

24
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,335
what are the potential benefits 

25
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,625
what risks are there in pursuing the project 

26
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:57,125
what are the contingencies to potential risks and so on 

27
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:02,570
answers to these questions will help you get a better overview of the situation 

28
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,700
and better understanding of what the project involves 

29
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,172
then you need to define your goals and objectives 

30
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:13,813
based on the answers to these questions 

31
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:17,850
defining success criteria is also very important 

32
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,770
what do you hope to achieve by the end of this project 

33
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,368
having clear goals and and

34
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:28,280
success criteria will help you to assess the project throughout its life cycle 

35
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,780
once you know the problem you want to address and understand the constraints and

36
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,990
goals then you can formulate the plan to come up with the answer 

37
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,330
that is the solution to your business problem 

38
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,920
as a summary defining the questions you are looking to find answers for

39
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,250
is a huge factor contributing to the success of a data science project 

40
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:56,830
by following the explained set of steps you can formulate better questions

41
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,500
to solve using analytical skills and link them to business value 

1
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,788
building a big data strategy 

2
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:30,760
before we focus on big data strategy let look at what strategy means 

3
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:34,090
although it is associated with a military term 

4
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,490
a dictionary search on strategy shows the meaning as a plan of action or

5
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,820
policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim 

6
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,990
this definition calls out the four major parts that need to be in any strategy 

7
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:59,110
namely aim policy plan and action 

8
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,620
now we are talking about a big data strategy 

9
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,770
so what do these four terms mean for us 

10
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:11,382
when building our big data strategy we look at what we have 

11
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:16,793
what high level goals we want to achieve what we need to do to get there 

12
00:20:16,793 --> 00:20:21,878
and what are the policies around data from the beginning to the end 

13
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:30,210
a big data strategy starts with big objectives 

14
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:34,939
notice that i did not say it starts with collecting data

15
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:40,171
because in this activity we are really trying to identify what

16
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:45,118
data is useful and why by focusing on what data to collect 

17
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,410
every organization or team is unique 

18
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:52,120
different projects have different objectives 

19
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,960
hence it important to first define what your team goals are 

20
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,570
have you ever had the scenario where you see the temperature on the weather report

21
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,350
and someone else highlights the humidity instead 

22
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,820
to find problems relevant to solve and

23
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,290
data related to it it might be useful to start with your objectives 

24
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,500
once you define these objectives or

25
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,030
more generally speaking questions to turn big data into advantage for your business 

26
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:26,450
you can look at what you have and analyze the gaps and actions to get there 

27
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,192
it is important to focus on both short term and

28
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:34,108
long term objectives in this activity 

29
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:38,791
these objectives should also be linked to big data analytics with business

30
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:39,720
objectives 

31
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:44,620
to make the best use of big data each company needs to evaluate how

32
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,220
data science or big data analytics would add value to their business objectives 

33
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,730
once you have established that analytics can help your business 

34
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,550
you need to create a culture to embrace it 

35
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,820
the first and foremost ingredient for

36
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,790
a successful data science program is organizational buy - in 

37
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,810
a big data strategy must have commitment and

38
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,010
sponsorship from the company leadership 

39
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:17,930
goals for using big data analytics should be developed with all stakeholders and

40
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:21,640
clearly communicated to everyone in the organization 

41
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,740
so that its value is understood and appreciated by all 

42
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,790
the next step is to build your data science team 

43
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,930
a diverse team with data scientists information technologists 

44
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:43,520
application developers and business owners is necessary to be effective 

45
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,830
as well as the mentality that everyone works together as partners with

46
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:48,950
common goals 

47
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,970
remember one for all 

48
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,960
no one is a customer or service provider of another 

49
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,360
rather everyone works together and delivers as a team 

50
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,930
since big data is a team game and multi - disciplinary 

51
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,180
a big part of a big data strategy is constant training

52
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,400
of team members on new big data tools and analytics 

53
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,050
as well as business practices and objectives 

54
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:23,095
this becomes even more critical if your business depends on deep expertise

55
00:23:23,095 --> 00:23:28,381
on one or more subject areas with subject matter experts working on problems 

56
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:29,838
utilizing big data 

57
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:38,138
such businesses might have subject matter experts who can be trained to add big

58
00:23:38,138 --> 00:23:43,730
data skills and provide more value added support than a newcomer would have 

59
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:48,024
similarly any project member would be trained to understand what

60
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:51,564
the business objectives and products are and how he or

61
00:23:51,564 --> 00:23:56,478
she can utilize big data to improve those objectives using his or her skills 

62
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:05,186
many organizations might benefit by having a small data science team whose main job

63
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:11,000
is do data experiments and test new ideas before they get deployed at full scale 

64
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,200
they might come up with a new idea themselves

65
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,990
based on the analysis they perform 

66
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,220
they take more research level role 

67
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,010
however their findings can drastically shape your business strategy

68
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:28,540
almost on a daily basis 

69
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,620
the impact of such teams becomes evident over time

70
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,950
as other parts of your organization starts to see the results of their finding and

71
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,790
analysis affecting their strategies 

72
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,550
they become strategic partners of all verticals in your business 

73
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,820
once you see that something works 

74
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,210
you can start collecting more data to see similar results at organizational scale 

75
00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,330
since data is key to any big data initiative it is essential

76
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,870
that data across the organization is easily accessed and integrated 

77
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,700
data silos as you know are like a death knell on effective analytics 

78
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,470
so barriers to data access must be removed 

79
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,430
opening up the silos must be encouraged and supported from the organization 

80
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:27,020
leaders in order to promote a data sharing mindset for the company 

81
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,900
another aspect of defining your big data strategy

82
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,700
is defining the policies around big data 

83
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,190
although it has an amazing amount of potential for your business 

84
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:45,540
using big data should also raise some concerns in long term planning for data 

85
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,270
although this is a very complex issue 

86
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,230
here are some questions you should think of addressing around policy 

87
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,350
what are the privacy concerns 

88
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:59,770
who should have access to or control data 

89
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:05,190
what is the lifetime of data which is sometimes defined as volatility 

90
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,290
anatomy of big data
