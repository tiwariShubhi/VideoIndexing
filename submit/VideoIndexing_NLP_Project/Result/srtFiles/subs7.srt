
1
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:06.640
The Sixth V, Value.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.970
In this module,

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.160
we described the five ways which are
considered to be dimensions of big data.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.947
Each way presented a challenging
dimension of big data namely,

5
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:25.500
size, complexity, speed,
quality, and connectedness.

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
Although we can list some other rays base
on the context, we prefer to list these

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.490
five s fundamental dimensions that this
big data specialization helps you work on.

8
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.940
However, at the heart of
the big data challenge

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
is turning all of the other dimensions
into truly useful business value.

10
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.640
The idea behind processing all
this big data in the first place

11
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
is to bring value to the problem at hand.

12
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.230
In week two we will explore how
to take the first steps into

13
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.270
starting to generate
value out of big data.

14
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.465
Now that we saw all the ways, let's focus
on an example of a big data challenge.

15
00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:16.940
Let's imagine now that you're part
of a company called Eglence Inc.

16
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.992
One of the products of Eglence Inc
is a highly popular mobile game

17
00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:25.506
called Catch the Pink Flamingo.

18
00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:30.046
It's a multi-user game where
the users have to catch special types

19
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:34.188
of pink flamingos that randomly
pop up on the world map on their

20
00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:38.670
screens based on the mission
that gets updated randomly.

21
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.120
The game is played by millions of
people online throughout the world.

22
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.110
One of the goals of the game is to form
a network of players to collectively

23
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.470
cover the world map with pink flamingo
sightings and compete other groups.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670
Users can pick their groups
based on player stats.

25
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.530
The game's website sends free
cool stuff to registered users.

26
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.483
Registration requires users to enter
demographic information such gender,

27
00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:12.542
year of birth, city, highest education,
and things like that.

28
00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:17.675
However, most of the users enter
inaccurate information about themselves,

29
00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:20.140
just like most of us do.

30
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.980
To help improve the game,
the game collects realtime usage activity

31
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.740
data from each player and
feeds them to it's data servers.

32
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.290
The players of this game are
enthusiastically active on social media,

33
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.480
and have strong
associations with the game.

34
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.424
A popular Twitter hashtag for
this game is, CatchThePinkFlamingo,

35
00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:48.780
which gets more than 200,000
mentions worldwide per day.

36
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.695
There are strong communities of
users who meet via social media and

37
00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:55.984
get together to play the game.

38
00:02:55.984 --> 00:03:02.960
Now, imagine yourself as the big data
solutions architect for Fun Games Inc.

39
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.640
There are definitely examples of all three
types of data sources in this example.

40
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.510
The mobile app generates data for
the analysis of user activity.

41
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.407
Twitter conversations of players form
a rich source of unstructured data from

42
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:19.005
people.

43
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.191
And the customer and

44
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.250
game records are examples of data
that this organization collects.

45
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.010
This is a challenging big data example

46
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.680
where all characteristics of
big data are represented.

47
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.240
There are high volumes of player, game and

48
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.560
Twitter data,
which also speaks to the variety of data.

49
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.465
The data streams from the mobile app,
website, and

50
00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:48.979
social media in real-time, which can
be defined as high velocity data.

51
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.203
The quality of demographic data
users enter is not clear, and

52
00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:58.334
there are networks of players which
are related to the balance of big data.

1
00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.918
Cloud Computing: An Important
Big Data Enabler.

2
00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:25.586
In our first lecture in this course,
we mentioned the cloud as one of

3
00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:29.450
the two influences of
the launch of the big data era.

4
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.050
We called it on-demand computing, and

5
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.390
we said that it enables us to
compute any time any anywhere.

6
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.110
Simply, whenever we demand it.

7
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.540
In this video,

8
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.260
we will see how we deploy the cloud to
our benefit in our big data applications.

9
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.990
The main idea behind cloud computing

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.340
is to transform computing
infrastructure into a commodity.

11
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.220
So application developers can focus on
solving application-specific challenges

12
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.880
instead of trying to build
infrastructure to run on.

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.760
So how does this happen?

14
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.840
We can simply define
a cloud computing service,

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.390
as a rental service for computing.

16
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.700
You rent what you want,
and return upon usage.

17
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.650
Think about this, you wouldn't buy, or

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.950
even build, a truck every time you
have to move a piece of furniture.

19
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.880
You would simply rent.

20
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.750
Why build a computing
cluster when you can rent?

21
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.930
Especially if you are not
using it all the time.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.900
Similarly, you can rent a car or
a bike when you are on vacation.

23
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.035
So you can bike anytime, anywhere.

24
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.970
Let's dig into this question.

25
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.240
What factors do you consider when you're
developing a solution for your yourself or

26
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.800
your client?

27
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880
Should you build a hardware and
software resources yourself?

28
00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.090
Or should you rent these
resources from the cloud?

29
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.390
Let's look at in-house hardware and
software resource building first.

30
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.975
If you choose to develop in-house
capabilities, you have to hire people and

31
00:02:12.975 --> 00:02:15.630
buy hardware that suits your requirements.

32
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.750
These includes, but not limited to,
buying networking hardware,

33
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.040
storage disks, upgrading hardware
when it becomes obsolete, and so on.

34
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.360
Not to forget, the real estate
cost of keeping the hardware.

35
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.190
How do you estimate the size
of your hardware needs?

36
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.910
Do you make a five year estimate,
or ten year?

37
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.110
In today's fast changing world,

38
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.620
it is becoming harder to
estimate future demands.

39
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.220
Getting the software that fits
your needs is equally challenging.

40
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.700
Most software installations
require a lot of tweaking and

41
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.030
manual intervention that
require a lot of skills.

42
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.025
You will need your engineers to do this.

43
00:03:02.025 --> 00:03:05.300
Compatibility issues bring
problems that are hard to foresee.

44
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.750
Most software is updated on a daily basis.

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.210
You must ensure you're updated.

46
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.870
This insures you avoid security risks and
get the best.

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:25.770
Over all, building your own data center or
computing power house can be expensive.

48
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.200
And it can be time consuming,
maintaining it is a task by itself.

49
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.760
This requires high initial
capital investments and

50
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.380
efficient operation of several
departments in your business,

51
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.540
which you might not have if
you are a startup company.

52
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.800
Most people forget to include
the cost of disposing old hardware.

53
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.788
Now lets see what the cloud can do for us.

54
00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:55.660
Cloud's benefits are similar to what you
would get from a rental car company.

55
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.720
You pay for what you use,
which means a low capital investment.

56
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.680
You don't need to go to the dealership,
do a negotiation, get a bank loan,

57
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.420
get insurance.

58
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.680
That means quick implementation
of your projects.

59
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.350
Just like you don't need to buy
a car if you only need a car for

60
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.200
a limited use, deploying your application
on a server that is geographically

61
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.200
closer to your client can give you
fast service and happy customers.

62
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.430
For startup and small business,
it can be challenging to do so.

63
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.620
Cloud lets you do this with a click.

64
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.950
You can be sitting at a coffeeshop or your
home and starting your Internet business,

65
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.700
without a huge capital investment,
thanks to the cloud.

66
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.230
And you don't need to have a five or
ten year resource estimation plan.

67
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.527
Adapt to your requirements faster if
your business is growing faster than you

68
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:56.130
thought.

69
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.330
Cloud lets you forget about
the resource management problems and

70
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.310
lets you focus on your business's products
or domain expertise with minimal cost.

71
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.500
Just as you can rent a truck or
a convertible at a rental car company,

72
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.520
you can build your own
custom machine on cloud.

73
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.430
With a custom machine,
we mean a commodity cluster

74
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.940
made out of the right type of
computing nodes for your application.

75
00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.930
You pick not only a CPU or a GPU, but

76
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.420
pick from a whole menu of compute,
memory and storage choices.

77
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.590
It's a buffet on the cloud.

78
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.900
Design machines to suit your application
requirements, data size and analytics.

79
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.740
Get what you want, and
pay for what you use.

80
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.380
Compare this with buying and

81
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.980
maintaining all combinations of
hardware that you possibly would use.

82
00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.860
That is so costly and
not possible at all times.

83
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.710
Thanks to all these advantages, there
are many cloud server providers today.

84
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:03.990
And the numbers are growing.

85
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.820
Here we list some of the players
in the cloud computing market.

86
00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.940
Take a moment to look at them.

87
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.990
You will probably recognize
some big names and

88
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.730
some others you have not
even heard of before.

89
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.670
As a summary, cloud does the heavy
lifting, so your team can extract

90
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.300
value from data with getting bogged
down in the infrastructure details.

91
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.680
Cloud provides convenient and

92
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.485
viable solutions for scaling your
prototype to a full fledged application.

93
00:06:38.485 --> 00:06:43.400
You can leverage the experts
to handle security,

94
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.450
robustness, and
let them handle the technical issues.

95
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.560
Your team can work on
utilizing your strengths

96
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.320
to solve your domain specific problem.

1
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.528
Cloud Service Models: Exploration
of Choices.

2
00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:24.709
There are many levels of services that
you can get from cloud providers.

3
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.880
Any cloud computing discussion will
involve terms like application

4
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
as a service, platform as a service,
and infrastructure as a service.

5
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.660
All of these refer to business
models around using the cloud

6
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
with different levels of engagement and
servicing similar to rental agreements.

7
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.470
IaaS, infrastructure as a service, can be
defined as a bare minimum rental service.

8
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.630
This is like renting a truck from
a company that you can assume has hardware

9
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.978
and you do the packing of your furniture,
and drive to your new house.

10
00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:15.430
You as the user of the service install and
maintain an operating system,

11
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.400
and other applications in
the infrastructure as a service model.

12
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.180
The Amazon EC2 cloud is a good example for
this model.

13
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.940
PaaS, platform as a service,

14
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.840
is the model where a user is provided
with an entire computing platform.

15
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
This could include the operating system
and programming languages that you need.

16
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.440
It could extend to include the database
of your choice, or even a web server.

17
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
You can develop, and

18
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.150
run your own application software,
on top of these layers.

19
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.510
The Google App engine and Microsoft Azure
are two examples of this model.

20
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.770
SaaS, the software as a service model,
is the model

21
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.090
in which the cloud service provider takes
the responsibilities for the hardware and

22
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.710
software environment such as the operating
system and the application software.

23
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.720
This means you can work on using
the application to solve your problem.

24
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.848
Dropbox is a very popular
software as a service platform.

25
00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:39.205
Ultimately, the decision of which service
you want to explore is a function of

26
00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.460
several variables.

27
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.760
It depends on the skill level of your
team to handle computing environment,

28
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080
development and maintenance.

29
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.010
It also depends on how you
might need to use the service.

30
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.990
You need to pick the right
service model that

31
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.520
best fits you in terms of long term goals.

32
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.610
Finally, when you're deploying a cloud
service you also have to understand

33
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.480
all the security risks, since your
data resides on third party service.

34
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.026
Security is a very important
aspect in today's world of growing

35
00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:18.207
digitization of information.

36
00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:21.990
You must make your client's
data safety a top priority,

37
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.859
and hence this should be an important
criteria in your decision.

38
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.870
All the security risks
must be understood and

39
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.000
evaluated as your data resides
on third party servers.

40
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.370
We are seeing other forms
of services being added

41
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.080
to the family of cloud services.

42
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.710
The logic of infrastructure, platform, and

43
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.550
Software as a Service is
getting extended further.

44
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.580
XaaS is an umbrella term that signifies

45
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.980
even finer-grain control over computing
resources that you want to rent.

46
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.520
For example, storage as a service,
communication as a service,

47
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.410
marketing as a service, and so on.

48
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.370
As a summary, infrastructure as a service,
platform as a service, and application

49
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.800
as a service are three main class service
models that are being used with success.

50
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.788
Picking one will depend on the number
of variables which are company's goals.

51
00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.840
These three models have
inspired many similar models

52
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.880
to emerge around cloud computing.

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.331
In this lecture we'll be learning about
the basic file manipulation commands for

2
00:00:04.331 --> 00:00:05.953
the Hadoop File System or HDFS.

3
00:00:05.953 --> 00:00:09.440
We'll first start by downloading
a text file of words.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.040
We'll use this text file to copy to and
from the local file system in HDFS and

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.730
later on we'll use it
to run word count on.

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.960
After we download the text file,
we'll open a terminal shell and

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.220
copy the text file from
the local file system to HDFS.

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.870
Next, we'll copy the file within HDFS and

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.880
also see how to copy file from
HDFS to the local file system.

10
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.223
Finally, we'll see how to
delete a file in HDFS.

11
00:00:38.223 --> 00:00:39.410
Let's start.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.390
We're going to download text
file to copy into HDFS.

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.610
It doesn't matter what the contents of
the text file is, so we'll download

14
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.380
the complete works of Shakespeare
since it contains interesting text.

15
00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:56.840
First, click on the icon here
to launch a web browser.

16
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.780
Now we'll search Google for
the complete works of Shakespeare.

17
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.880
I'm going to be using
this first link here.

18
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.500
And we'll provide this link
in the reading section.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.080
So this is the complete
works of Shakespeare and

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.700
we'll save it to a text file in the local
file system by clicking on the icon here,

21
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.790
the Open Menu and selecting save page.

22
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.105
So we'll call it words.txt.

23
00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:52.090
And the Save in folder, it's going to
save it into the Downloads directory.

24
00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:02.800
Once that completes, we'll open a terminal
window by clicking on the icon here.

25
00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:13.480
So if we go into the downloads
Ddrectory by typing a cd Downloads and

26
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.320
running ls, we can see that words.txt
was successfully downloaded.

27
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.100
Moving on, let's copy words.txt from the
local file system to the HDFS file system.

28
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.711
The command to do this is hadoop
fs- copyFromLocal words.txt.

29
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.330
When I run this,
it'll copy it from the local directory and

30
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.595
local file system to HDFS.

31
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.681
We can see that the file was
copied by running hadoop fs -ls.

32
00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:57.630
You can see that the file
was successfully copied.

33
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.673
Next, we can copy this file
to another file within HDFS.

34
00:03:05.673 --> 00:03:14.170
We can do this by running hadoop
fs -cp words.txt words2.txt.

35
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.500
The first words.txt is the file
that already exists in HDFS.

36
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.760
The second words 2.txt

37
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.230
is the new file that we're going to
create when we run this command.

38
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.182
Let's run it, and again we're can run

39
00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:38.033
hadoopfs-ls to see the files in HDFS.

40
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:44.364
We can see the original file words.txt,
and the copy that was made, words2.txt.

41
00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:52.680
Let's copy words2.txt from
HDFS to the local filesystem.

42
00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.909
We can do this by running hadoop
fs -copyToLocal words2.txt.

43
00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:09.210
After I run this command, I can call ls to
see the contents of the local file system.

44
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.455
So now we have the new file words2.txt
which we've just copied from HDFS.

45
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.980
The last step in this lecture
is to delete a file in HDFS.

46
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.881
We can delete words2.txt
by running hadoop fs,

47
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:32.404
but is rn words2.txt.

48
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.930
As you can see,
it printed that it deleted the file.

49
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.806
We can also run hadoop fs- ls,
to verify that the file is deleted.

50
00:04:45.246 --> 00:04:50.872
You can see that there's only the original
words.txt, and words2.txt was deleted.

1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.260
Getting started.

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.310
Why do we worry about foundations?

3
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:19.079
Starting next week you'll start
diving into the details of the Hadoop

4
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.650
framework for big data.

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.460
Before you start, taking a little
bit of time to understand some core

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.580
concepts will help you to digest the
information on Hadoop better and faster.

7
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
Imagine yourself attending
a chemistry lab.

8
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.700
Before you start hearing about
the tubes and mixtures, you really need

9
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.650
to understand the chemistry or theory
of the practical concepts in the lab.

10
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.650
Similarly, learning these
concepts now will help

11
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.880
you with your understanding of the
practical concepts in the Hadoop lectures.

12
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.290
In addition, we want to prepare you to
understand the tools beyond Hadoop.

13
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.410
Any big data system that you find
will be built on these core concepts.

14
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.200
So these foundations will
help you beyond this course.

15
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.460
Now, let's get started.
