00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.576
[SOUND] The Splunk platform for
operational intelligence is

2
00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:10.493
a revolutionary suite of products that
is unlocking unprecedented value for

3
00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:13.779
thousands of customers around the world.

4
00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.970
Why Splunk?

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.420
It all starts with machine data.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.970
Machine data is the big data generated by

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.710
all the technologies that
power our businesses.

8
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.320
From the applications, servers, websites,
and network devices in the data center and

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.300
the cloud, to the mobile device
in the palm of your hand.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.460
Thermostats, train sensors, electric cars,
and the Internet of things.

11
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.412
Machine data is everywhere.

12
00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:41.710
It's fast-growing and complex.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.550
It's also incredibly valuable, why?

14
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.630
Because it contains a definitive
record of all activity and behavior.

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.380
Splunk software collects and
indexes this data at massive scale,

16
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.340
from wherever it's generated,
regardless of format or source.

17
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.290
Users can quickly and
easily monitor, search, analyze, and

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.680
report on their data, all in real time.

19
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.640
Machine data is different.

20
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.450
It can't be processed and
analyzed using traditional methods.

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.540
Splunk software does not rely on brittle
schemas and inflexible databases.

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.660
Splunk is easy to deploy, easy to use, and

23
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.290
easy to scale, whether on premises or
in a public, private, or hybrid cloud.

24
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.960
Splunk is also available
as a cloud service.

25
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.942
And for big data environments that
used Hadoop for cheap app storage,

26
00:01:31.942 --> 00:01:34.522
we have Hunk, Splunk analytics for Hadoop.

27
00:01:34.522 --> 00:01:36.950
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.843
Our customers from around
the world illustrate why so

29
00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:42.070
many organizations use Splunk.

30
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.710
Intuit has standardized on Splunk,
delivering operational visibility for

31
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.060
their leading online products, including
QuickBooks, Quicken, and TurboTax.

32
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.770
Intuit considers Splunk one of
their cornerstone technologies

33
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.950
that is helping them innovate and
deliver better service to their customers.

34
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.210
Cisco, one of the world's
largest technology providers,

35
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.940
empowers their global security
team with Splunk enterprise

36
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.220
to gain a centralized view into
end user and system activities.

37
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.000
Splunk has dramatically helped
improve their incident detection and

38
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.690
response rate.

39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.650
Splunk was key to Domino's Pizza's
success during the Super Bowl,

40
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.020
by monitoring database uptime and
order response.

41
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.710
Armed with new levels of
customer understanding,

42
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.490
Domino's was able to strengthen their
online business, in addition to saving

43
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.960
hundreds of thousands of dollars replacing
legacy technologies with Splunk.

44
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.350
We are thrilled to hear Domino's
call Splunk their secret sauce.

45
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.200
Another great Splunk story includes
cars and the Internet of things.

46
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.813
Working together with the Ford Motor
Company and Ford's OpenXC platform,

47
00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:52.816
Splunk delivered connected car dashboards
to examine driving behavior and

48
00:02:52.816 --> 00:02:54.079
vehicle performance.

49
00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:58.529
UK-based Tesco is one of
the world's largest retailers,

50
00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:04.650
with nearly 1 million customers and
a half billion online orders per week.

51
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.480
Customer satisfaction
is a critical metric.

52
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.580
Tesco deployed Splunk to gain a unified
view across their websites, transactions,

53
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.410
and business, gaining valuable digital
intelligence about their customers.

54
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.820
Splunk was founded to pursue a disruptive
vision to make machine data accessible,

55
00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.490
usable, and valuable to everyone.
