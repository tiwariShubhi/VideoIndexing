[SOUND] Hello, this is Chris Busheers,

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.881
part of the Splunk education team.

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.530
In this video, I'll show you how
install Splunk onto a Window's server.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.869
First we need to get the software
from the splunk.com download page.

5
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.710
We will need to select that
the platform is 32 or 64-bit.

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.605
If you aren't sure if your system is 32 or

7
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.200
64-bit, you can check
your system properties.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.750
As you can see, this server is 64-bit,
so we can install that version.

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.720
If we saw a system type of 32-bit,
we would download the 32-bit version.

10
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.020
We run the installer by
double clicking on it.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.920
There is button to view the license
agreement, and a check box to accept it.

12
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.800
At this point we can either install
Splunk with the defaults, or

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.160
customize our installation.

14
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.379
Let's click on the customize options
to see what settings can be selected.

15
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.860
The first option is to change
the installation location of Splunk.

16
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.940
We are fine with this location,
so we click Next.

17
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.100
Now we must choose what account type
to install Splunk as, Local System or

18
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.830
Domain Account.

19
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.420
A Local System account will allow
Splunk to access all data on, or

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.550
forwarded, to this machine.

21
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.140
A Domain Account will allow
you to collect logs and

22
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.070
metrics from remote machines as
well as local and forwarded data.

23
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.010
You are required to provide a Domain
Account with the proper domain rights

24
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.730
to use this type.

25
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.530
Local System works well for
us, so we click Next.

26
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.012
We can select to have a shortcut to Splunk
added, and click Install to continue.

27
00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:48.319
[MUSIC]

28
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.750
Once installed, we can select to have
Splunk launch, and click Finish.

29
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.720
This Splunk web interface
opens in our default browser.

30
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.130
We enter the default user name of admin,
and a password of change made.

31
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.400
A dialog box appears asking
us to change our password.

32
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.310
It is always best practice to do this.

33
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.820
Once logged in, we are taken to
the Splunk launcher homepage.

34
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.780
And that's all it takes to get
Splunk installed on Windows.

35
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.895
Now dig in, and start exploring.

36
00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:21.000
