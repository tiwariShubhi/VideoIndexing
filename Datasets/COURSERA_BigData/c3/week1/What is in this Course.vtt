00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.240
Welcome to Big Data Integration and
Processing.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.190
 Welcome to course three of
the big data specialization.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.710
I'm Amarnath Gupta.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.650
 And I'm Ilkay Altintas.

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.590
We are really excited to
work with you in this course

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.820
to develop your understanding and skills
in big data integration and processing.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.180
By now you might have just
finished our first two courses and

8
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.870
learned the basics of big data
modelling and management.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.480
If you haven't, it's not required.

10
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.560
But for those that less background
in the data modelling and

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.680
data management areas you
might find it valuable.

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.030
 We understand that you may not have
any background on data management.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.382
We are going to introduce Query languages,
we'll first look at SQL in some detail,

14
00:00:47.382 --> 00:00:51.740
and then move to Query languages for
MongoDB which is a semi structured

15
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.260
data management system, and Aerospike,
which is a key value store.

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.200
 We will also introduce concepts
related to processing of big data as

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.890
big data pipelines.

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.160
We talk about data structures and
transformations related to batch and

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.230
stream processing as steps in a pipeline.

20
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.100
Providing us a way to talk
about big data processing

21
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.180
without getting into the details
of the underlying technologies.

22
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.710
Once we have reviewed the concepts and
related systems, we will switch gears

23
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.370
to hands on exercises with Spark,
one of the most popular big data engines.

24
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.060
We will show you examples of patch and
stream processing using Spark.

25
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.410
 As you know for
many data science applications

26
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.140
one has to use many different databases
and analyze the integrated data.

27
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.160
In fact, data integration is one leading
cause leading to the bigness of data.

28
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.780
We'll give you a rapid exposure to
information integration systems

29
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.530
through use cases and point out the big
data aspects one should pay attention to.

30
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.620
 We are also excited to show you
examples of data processing using Splunk.

31
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.510
Our goal here is to provide you
with simple hands on exercises

32
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.550
that require no programming, but

33
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.660
show you how one can use interfaces like
Splunk to manage and process big data.

34
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.820
We wish you a fun time learning and

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.080
hope to hear from you in the discussions
forums and learner stories as usual.

36
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.880
 Well, happy learning and think big data
