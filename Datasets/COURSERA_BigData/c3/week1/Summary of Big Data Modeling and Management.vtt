00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome back.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.705
In this video, we will provide you
a quick summary of the main points from

3
00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:12.303
our last course on big data modeling and
management.

4
00:00:12.303 --> 00:00:16.882
If you had just completed our second
course and do not need a refresher,

5
00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.261
you may now skip to the next lecture.

6
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:24.311
After this video, you will be able
to recall why big data modeling and

7
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:29.536
management is essential in preparing
to gain insights from your data,

8
00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:32.693
summarize different kids of data models.

9
00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:38.351
Describe streaming data and the different challenges
it presents, and explain the differences

10
00:00:38.351 --> 00:00:43.403
between a database management system and
a big data management system.

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.140
In the second course, we described
a data model as a specification

12
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.194
that precisely characterizes
the structure of the data,

13
00:00:55.194 --> 00:01:00.260
the operations on the data, and
the constraints that may apply on data.

14
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.070
For example, a data model may state that

15
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.030
a data is structured like
a two-dimensional array or a matrix.

16
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.050
For this structure,
one may have a data access operation,

17
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.720
which given an index of the array,
we use the cell of the array to refer to.

18
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.820
A data model may also specify
constraints on the data.

19
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.720
For example, while a total
data set may have many arrays,

20
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.640
the name of each array must be unique and

21
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.420
the values of a specific array
must always be greater than zero.

22
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.335
Database management systems handle
low level data management operations,

23
00:01:48.335 --> 00:01:51.980
help organization of the data
using a data model, and

24
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.147
provide an open programmable
access to data.

25
00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:01.346
We covered a number of data models.

26
00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:04.911
We showed four models that were
discussed in more details.

27
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.810
The relational data to date
is the most used data model.

28
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.189
Here, data is structured like tables
which are formally called relations.

29
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.840
The relational data model has been
implemented in traditional database

30
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.120
systems.

31
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.240
But they are being refreshly implemented
in modern data systems over Hadoop and

32
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.400
Spark and
are getting deployed on cloud platforms.

33
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.930
The second category of data gaining
popularity is semi-structured data,

34
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.840
which includes documents like HTML pages,
XML data and

35
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.960
JSON data that are used by
many Internet applications.

36
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.201
This data can have one element nested or

37
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:55.674
embedded within another data element and
hence can often be modeled as a tree.

38
00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.480
The third category of data
models is called graph data.

39
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.700
A graph is a network where
nodes represent entities and

40
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
edges represent relationships
between pairs of such entities.

41
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.675
For example, in a social network,
nodes may represent users and

42
00:03:19.675 --> 00:03:23.160
edges may represent their friendship.

43
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.990
The operations performed on graph data
includes traversing the network so

44
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.000
that one can find friend of
a friend of a friend if needed.

45
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.890
In contrast to the previous three models,
that there is a structure to the data,

46
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.280
the text data is much more unstructured
because an entire data item

47
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.780
like a new article can
be just a text string.

48
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.540
However, text is the primary form of data

49
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.120
in information retrieval systems or
search engines like Google.

50
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.290
We also discussed streaming data,
or data with velocity, as a special

51
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.580
class of data that continually come
to the system at some data rate.

52
00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:17.308
Examples can be found in data coming
from road sensors that measure traffic

53
00:04:17.308 --> 00:04:21.636
patterns or stock price data from
the stock exchange that may come

54
00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.111
in volumes from stock
exchanges all over the world.

55
00:04:27.563 --> 00:04:35.090
Streaming data is special because a stream
is technically an infinite data source.

56
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.050
And therefore,
we keep filling up memory and

57
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.390
storage and will eventually go
beyond the capacity of any system.

58
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.720
Streaming data, therefore, needs
a different kind of management system.

59
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.135
For this reason,
streaming data is processed in memory,

60
00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:57.841
in chunks which are also called windows.

61
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:01.226
Often only the necessary
part of the data stream or

62
00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:05.186
the results of queries against
the data stream is stored.

63
00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:13.180
A typical type of query against streaming
data are alerts or notifications.

64
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.933
The system notices an event like multiple
stock price changing within a short time.

65
00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:24.160
Streaming data is also used for
prediction.

66
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:31.287
For instance, based on wind direction and
temperature data streams,

67
00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:34.768
one can predict how a wildfire
is going to spread.

68
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.522
In the last course, we also covered
a number of data systems that we called

69
00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:44.590
big data management systems.

70
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.890
These systems use
different data models and

71
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:55.030
have different capabilities, but
are characterized by some common features.

72
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.430
They are also designed from the start for
parallel and distributed processing.

73
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.100
Most of them implement data partition
parallelism, which, if you can recall,

74
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.890
refers to the process of segmenting
the data into multiple machines so

75
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:16.839
data retrieval and manipulations can be
performed in parallel on these machines.

76
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.360
Many of these systems allow a large
number of users who constantly update and

77
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.510
query the system.

78
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:32.190
Some of the systems do not maintain
transaction consistency with every update.

79
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.224
That means,

80
00:06:34.224 --> 00:06:39.437
not all the machines may have all
the updates guaranteed at every moment.

81
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:46.460
However, most of them provide
a guarantee of eventual consistency,

82
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.780
which means all the machines will
get all updates sooner or later.

83
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.920
Therefore, providing better accuracy and
time.

84
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.740
The third common characteristic
of big data management systems is

85
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.750
that they are often built on top of
a Hadoop-like platform that provides

86
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.040
automatic replication and
a map-reduce style processing ability.

87
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:16.440
Some of the data operations performed
within these systems make use of these

88
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.829
lower level capabilities.

89
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.520
After this refresher on data modeling and

90
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.650
management, let's start big data
integration and processing.
