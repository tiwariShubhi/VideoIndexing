00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.340
Let's talk about what it means to
build a classification model and

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.990
how building a model differs
from applying a model.

3
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.290
After this video,

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.170
you will be able to discuss what
building a classification model means.

5
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.511
Explain the difference between
building and applying a model.

6
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:20.910
And summarize why the parameters
of a model needs to be adjusted.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.150
A machine learning model
is a mathematical model.

8
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.560
In the general sense, this means that
the model has parameters and uses

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.630
equations to determine the relationship
between its inputs and outputs.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.730
The parameters are used by the model to
modify the inputs to generate the outputs.

11
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.930
The model adjusts its parameters
in order to correct or

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770
refine this input, output relationship.

13
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.630
Here's an example of a simple model.

14
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.150
This mathematical model represents a line.

15
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.554
y is the output, x is the input,
m determines the slope of the line and

16
00:00:58.554 --> 00:01:05.080
b determines the y-intercept or
where the line crosses the y-axis.

17
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.720
m and b are the model's parameters.

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.722
Given a specific value for

19
00:01:09.722 --> 00:01:14.368
x, the model uses as parameters
along with x to determine y.

20
00:01:14.368 --> 00:01:19.168
By adjusting the values for
the parameters m and b,

21
00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:24.760
the model can adjust how the input
x matched to the output y.

22
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.262
Here we see how the output y changes for

23
00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:33.844
the same value of input x,
when parameter b changes.

24
00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:39.480
Recall that b is the y-intercept, or
where the line crosses the y-axis.

25
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.048
The value of b is +1 for
the red line and -1 for the blue line.

26
00:01:48.048 --> 00:01:51.996
For the input x=1, the value of y is 3 for

27
00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:56.175
the red line,
as indicated by the red arrow.

28
00:01:56.175 --> 00:02:02.024
For the blue line, when the parameter
b changes from +1 to -1,

29
00:02:02.024 --> 00:02:07.670
for x=1, the value of y is 1,
as indicated by the blue arrow.

30
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.710
So we see that with just a simple
change in one model parameter,

31
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.074
the input to output mapping changes.

32
00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:19.495
A machine learning model
works in a similar way.

33
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:22.285
It maps input values to output values.

34
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:25.640
And it adjusts the parameters
in order to correct or

35
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.145
refine this input-output mapping.

36
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.665
The parameters of a machine
learning model are adjusted or

37
00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:36.185
estimated from the data
using a learning algorithm.

38
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.240
This, in essence,
is what is involved in building a model.

39
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.869
This process is referred to by many terms,
such as model building,

40
00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:51.326
model creation,
model training and model fitting.

41
00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:52.803
In building a model,

42
00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:57.736
we want to adjust the parameters in
order to reduce the model's error.

43
00:02:57.736 --> 00:03:02.424
In the case of supervised tasks,
such as classification, this means getting

44
00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:07.340
the model's outputs to match the targets
or desired outputs as much as possible.

45
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.600
Since the classification task is
to predict the correct category or

46
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.650
class, given the input variables,

47
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.150
you can think of the classification
problem visually as carving out the input

48
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.910
space as regions corresponding
to the different class labels.

49
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.160
In this diagram for example,
the classification model needs to form

50
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.350
the boundaries to define the regions
separating red triangles

51
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.580
from blue diamonds, from green circles,
from yellow squares.

52
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.180
In this example, if a sample falls within
the region in the upper right corner,

53
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.160
it will be classified as a blue diamond.

54
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.215
Classification decisions are based on
these regions, and the regions are defined

55
00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:57.316
by the boundaries, as indicated by
the dashed lines in the diagram.

56
00:03:57.316 --> 00:04:00.349
So these boundaries are referred
to as decision boundaries.

57
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.720
Building a classification then means using
the data to adjust the model's parameters

58
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.680
in order to form decision boundaries
to separate the target classes.

59
00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:15.770
Note that the term classifier is often
used to mean classification model.

60
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.650
In general,
building a classification model,

61
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.190
as well as other machine learning models,
involves two phases.

62
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.515
The first is the training phase,
in which the model is constructed and

63
00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:34.190
its parameters adjusted using as
what referred to as training data.

64
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.020
Training data is the data set
used to train or create a model.

65
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.750
The second is the testing phase.

66
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.984
This is where the learned
model is applied to new data.

67
00:04:45.984 --> 00:04:48.250
That is,
data not used in training the model.

68
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.570
Here's another way to
look at the two phases.

69
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.130
In a training phase, the learning
algorithm uses the training data

70
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.070
to adjust the model's
parameters to minimize errors.

71
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.700
At the end of the training phase,
you get the trained model.

72
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.270
In the testing phase,
the trained model is applied to test data.

73
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:16.220
Test data is separate from training data
and is previously unseen by the model.

74
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.810
The model is then evaluated on
how it performs on the test data.

75
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.607
The goal in building a classifier
model is to have the model

76
00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.696
perform well on training,
as well as test data.

77
00:05:27.696 --> 00:05:30.611
We will discuss in more detail
the use of training and

78
00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:35.470
test data sets in the next module,
when we discuss model evaluation.

79
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.330
To adjust a model's parameters,
we need to apply a learning algorithm.

80
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.460
We will discuss the specific algorithms
to build a classification model in

81
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.510
the next few lectures.
