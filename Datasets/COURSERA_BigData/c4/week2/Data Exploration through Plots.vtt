00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.060
Visualizing your data is a very
effective way to explore your data.

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.780
We'll look at different ways to
visualize your data in this lecture.

3
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.950
After this video,

4
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.150
you will be able to discuss how plots
can be useful in exploring data,

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.669
describe how you would use a scatter plot,
and summarize what a boxplot shows.

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.390
Visualizing data,
that is looking at data graphically,

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.800
is a great way to explore your data set.

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.505
Data visualization is a nice complement
to using summary statistics for

9
00:00:30.505 --> 00:00:31.422
exploring data.

10
00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:35.358
We will cover several ways to
visualize your data in this lecture.

11
00:00:35.358 --> 00:00:40.080
There are several types of plots that
you can use to visualize your data.

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.350
We will go over histogram, line plot,
scatter plot, bar plot, and box plot.

13
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.550
These are the most commonly used plots,
but there are many others as well.

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.930
A histogram is used to display
the distribution of a variable.

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.250
The range of values for the variable
is divided into the number of bins, and

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.610
the number of values that fall
into each bin is counted.

17
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.660
Which determines the height of each bin.

18
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.600
A histogram can reveal many things
about a variable in your data, for

19
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.200
example, you can usually determine
the central tendency of a variable,

20
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.060
that is where the majority
of the values lie.

21
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.989
You can also see the most frequent
value of values for that variable.

22
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.940
A histogram also shows whether the values
for that variable are skewed and

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.920
whether the skewness is to
the left towards smaller values or

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.810
to the right towards larger values.

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.340
You can also pick outliers in
the histogram as shown on the bottom plot.

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.460
A line plot shows how data
values change over time.

27
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.910
The values of a variable or
variables are shown on the Y axis and

28
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.780
the X axis shows the motion of time.

29
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.810
The resulting line displays
the data values over time.

30
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.780
A line plot can show
patterns in your variables.

31
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.840
For example, a cyclical pattern
can be detected as in this plot,

32
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.720
where the values start high,
then decrease and go back up again.

33
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.060
Trends can also be detected as
shown in the upper-right plot

34
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.550
where the values fluctuate but
show a general upward trend over time.

35
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.030
It is also easy to compare how multiple
variables change over time on a single

36
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.930
line plot as displayed in
the center bottom plot.

37
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.360
A scatter plot is a great way to visualize
the relationship between two variables.

38
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.830
One variable is on the x axis.

39
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.530
The other variable is on
the y axis Each sample is

40
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.010
a product using the values of the 2
variables aspects and Y coordinates.

41
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.590
The resulting plot shows how one variable
changes as the other is changed.

42
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.220
A scatter plot can be used to display
the correlation between 2 variables.

43
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.090
For example, 2 variables such as
the high temperature of the day, and

44
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.240
the low temperature of the day,

45
00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.920
can have a positive correlation
as shown in this plot.

46
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.200
A positive correlation means that as
the value of one variable increases,

47
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.205
the value of the other variable
also increases by a similar amount.

48
00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:13.745
The upper right scatter plot shows
a negative correlation between two

49
00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:15.015
variables.

50
00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:18.285
This means that as the value
of one variable increases,

51
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:22.730
there is a corresponding decrease in
the other variable, two variables

52
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.440
can also have a non-linear correlation
as shown in the lower left plot.

53
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.040
This means that a change
in one variable will not

54
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.550
always correspond to the same
change in the other variable.

55
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.010
This is indicated by the curve in
the scatter plot as opposed to something

56
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.640
closer to a straight line for
linear correlation.

57
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.890
There can also be no correlation
between two variables.

58
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.910
In this case, you will see something
like randomly placed dots as

59
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.730
displayed in the lower right plot,
indicating no

60
00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.250
relationship between how the two variables
change with respect to each other.

61
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.980
A bar plot is used to show
the distribution of categorical variables.

62
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.980
Recall that a histogram is also used to
look at the distribution of the values

63
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.450
of the variable.

64
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.860
The difference is that in general,
a histogram is used for

65
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.990
numeric variables whereas a bar plot
is used for categorical variables.

66
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.850
In a bar chart, the different categories
of a categorical variable is shown along

67
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.870
the x-axis, and the count of instances for
each category is displayed on the y-axis.

68
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.670
This is an effective way to
compare the different categories.

69
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.700
For example, the most frequent
category can be easily determined.

70
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.790
A bar plot is also a great way to
compare two categorical variables.

71
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.630
For example, this plot compares
two categorical variables.

72
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.270
One in blue and the other in orange,
each with three different categories.

73
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.638
Here you can see that for
the first category,

74
00:04:47.638 --> 00:04:49.757
the blue variable has the higher count,

75
00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:53.949
while the orange variable has a higher
count for the second and third category.

76
00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.642
This type of Bar Plot is
called a Grouped Bar Chart.

77
00:04:57.642 --> 00:05:00.480
And the different variables
of products side by side.

78
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.580
A different kind of comparison can be
performed using a Stacked Bar chart

79
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.040
as seen in a lower right quad.

80
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.460
Here, the accounts for the two variables
are stacked on top of each other for

81
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.160
each category.

82
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.700
With this bar chart, you can
determine that the combined count for

83
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.830
the first category is about equal to
the combine count for the second category,

84
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.000
while the compliant count for
the third category is much larger.

85
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.140
A box plot is another plot that shows
the distribution of a numeric variable,

86
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.510
it shows the distribution in a different
format than the histogram, however.

87
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.990
This is how a box plot displays
the distribution of values for

88
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.530
a variable, the gray portion
in the figure is the box part.

89
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.110
The lower and upper boundaries of
the box represent the 25th and

90
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.830
75th percentiles respectively.

91
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.480
This means that the box represents
the middle 50% of the data,

92
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.430
the median is the 50th percentile,
meaning that 50% of

93
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.560
the data is greater than its value and
50% of the data is less than this value.

94
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.540
The top and bottom lines are the Whiskers
and represent the 10th and

95
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.890
90th percentiles respectively.

96
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.210
So, 80% of the data are in the region
indicated by the upper extreme and

97
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.710
lower extreme.

98
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.790
Any data values outside of
this region are outliers and

99
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.080
are indicated as single
point on the box plot.

100
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.600
Note that there are different
variations of the box plot,

101
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.520
with the whiskers representing
different types of extreme values.

102
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.700
Box plots provide a compact way to
show how variables are distributed, so

103
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.660
they are often used to compare variables.

104
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.920
The box plot on the left for

105
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.540
example compares the base salary for
two different roles.

106
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.720
This plot can quickly provide information
regarding the median value, the range and

107
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.950
the spread of the two different variables.

108
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.200
We can quickly see that
the median salary for

109
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.160
the marketing role is higher
than the research role.

110
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.210
We can also see that the variation or
spread of the values for

111
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.240
marketing is greater than for research,
due to the larger area of the purple box.

112
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.380
A box plot can also show you if
the distribution of the data values is

113
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.740
symmetrical, positively skewed or
negatively skewed.

114
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.480
Here we see that a box plot can
also be displayed on its side.

115
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.890
A symmetric distribution is
indicated if the line in the box

116
00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.090
which specifies the median,
is in the center of the box.

117
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.430
A negative skew is indicated
when the median is to the right

118
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.030
of the center of the box.

119
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.470
This means that there are more
values that are less than the median

120
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.010
than there are values
greater than the median.

121
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.310
Similarly, a positive skew is indicated
when the median is to the left

122
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.270
of the center of the box.

123
00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:47.370
To summarize,
data visualization provides a quick and

124
00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.910
intuitive way to examine your data.

125
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.680
Data visualization should be
used in conjunction with summary

126
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.420
statistics that we discussed in
the last lecture to explore data.

127
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.210
The different types of plots that we have
covered in this lecture will also be very

128
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.960
helpful in communicating your results
throughout your machine learning project.
