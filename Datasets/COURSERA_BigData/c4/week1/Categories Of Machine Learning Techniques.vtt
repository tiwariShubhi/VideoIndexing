00:00:02.012 --> 00:00:05.776
Now that we know what machine learning
is and have seen some examples of it,

2
00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:09.010
let's talk about how we
do machine learning.

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.015
In this lecture we will get an overview of
the main categories of machine learning

4
00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:13.625
techniques.

5
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:18.315
After this video you will be able to

6
00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:21.805
describe the main categories of
machine learning techniques and

7
00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:25.469
summarize how supervised learning
differs from unsupervised learning.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.260
There are different categories of
machine learning techniques for

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.150
different types of problems.

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.240
The main categories are listed here.

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.630
They are classification,
regression, cluster analysis, and

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.450
association analysis.

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.000
We will cover each one in
detail in the following slides.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.830
In classification, the goal is to
predict the category of the input data.

15
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.840
An example of this is predicting the
weather as being sunny, rainy, windy, or

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.080
cloudy.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.260
The input data in this case would be
sensor data specifying the temperature,

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.840
relative humidity, atmospheric pressure,
wind speed, wind direction, etc.

19
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.502
The target or what you're trying to
predict would be the different weather

20
00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:14.670
categories, sunny, windy,
rainy, and cloudy.

21
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.580
Another example is to classify
a tumor as either benign or malignant.

22
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.460
In this case,
the classification is referred to as

23
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.040
binary classification since
there are only two categories.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.400
But you can have many categories as well.

25
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.170
As the weather prediction
problem shown here.

26
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.080
Another example is to identify hand
written digits as being in one of ten

27
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.950
categories, zero to nine.

28
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.280
Some more examples of classification
are classifying a tumor from a medical

29
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.710
image as being benign or malignant.

30
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.430
Predicting whether it
will rain the next day.

31
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.410
Determining if a loan application is
high-risk, medium-risk or low-risk.

32
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.860
Identifying the sentiment of a tweet or

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.990
review as being positive,
negative, or neutral.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.870
When your model has to predict
a numeric value instead of a category,

35
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.380
then the task becomes
a regression problem.

36
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.920
An example of regression is to
predict the price of a stock.

37
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.320
The stock price is a numeric value,
not a category.

38
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.700
So this is a regression task
instead of a classification task.

39
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.480
If you were to predict whether
the stock price will rise or

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.620
fall, then that would be
a classification problem.

41
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.340
But if you're predicting
the actual price of the stock,

42
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.620
then that is a regression problem.

43
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.340
That is the main difference between
classification and regression.

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.250
In classification,
you're predicting a category and

45
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.520
in regression,
you're predicting a numeric value.

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.000
Some other examples of regression
are estimating the demand of a product

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.570
based on time or season of the year.

48
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.130
Predicting a score on a test,

49
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.210
determining the likelihood of
how effective a drug will be for

50
00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.270
a particular patient, predicting
the amount of rain for a region.

51
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.550
In cluster analysis,

52
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.275
the goal is to organize similar
items in your data set into groups.

53
00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:10.120
A very common application of
cluster analysis is referred to as

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.160
customer segmentation.

55
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.227
This means that you're separating your
customer base into different groups or

56
00:03:16.227 --> 00:03:18.054
segments based on customer types.

57
00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:22.833
For example it would be very beneficial
to segment your customers into seniors,

58
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.230
adults and teenagers.

59
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.544
These groups have different likes and
dislikes and

60
00:03:27.544 --> 00:03:29.383
have different purchasing behaviors.

61
00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.569
By segmenting your customers to different
groups you can more effectively provide

62
00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.652
marketing adds targeted for
each groups particular interests.

63
00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:40.750
Note that cluster analysis is
also referred to as clustering.

64
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.810
Some other examples of cluster
analysis are, identifying areas of

65
00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.840
similar topography, such as desert region,
grassy areas, mountains etc.

66
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.610
Categorizing different types of
tissues from medical images.

67
00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.080
Determining different groups of weather
patterns, such as snowy, dry, monsoon.

68
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.810
And discovering hot spots for different
types of crime from police reports.

69
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.770
The goal in association analysis is
to come up with a set of rules to

70
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.230
capture associations between items or
events.

71
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.520
The rules are used to determine when
items or events occur together.

72
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.500
A common application of association
analysis is known as market

73
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.300
basket analysis.

74
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.020
Which is used to understand
customer purchasing behavior.

75
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.000
For example, association analysis can
reveal that banking customers who have

76
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.330
CDs, or Certificates of Deposits,
also tend to be interested in

77
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.970
other investment vehicles such
as money market accounts.

78
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.840
This information can be used for
cross selling.

79
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.020
If you advertise money market accounts to
your customers with CDs they are likely to

80
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.390
open such an account.

81
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.700
According to data mining folklore
a supermarket chain used association

82
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.410
analysis to discover a connection between
two seemingly unrelated products.

83
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.130
They discovered that many
customers who go to the store

84
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.150
late on Sunday night to buy
diapers also tend to buy beer.

85
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.470
This information was then
used to place beer and

86
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.620
diapers close together and
they saw a jump in sales of both items.

87
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.630
This is the famous diaper,
beer connection.

88
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.600
Some other applications of association
analysis are recommending similar

89
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.180
items based on the purchasing behavior or
browsing histories of customers.

90
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.720
Finding items that are often purchased
together, such as garden hose and

91
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.080
potting soil, and

92
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.910
offer sales on these related items at the
same time to drive sales of both items.

93
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.970
Identifying web pages that
are often accessed together so

94
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.070
that you can more efficiently offer up
these related web pages at the same time.

95
00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:49.890
We have now looked at the different
categories of machine learning techniques.

96
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.240
They are classification,
regression, cluster analysis, and

97
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.280
association analysis.

98
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.753
We have also seen some
examples of each category

99
00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:04.764
There is also another categorization
of machine learning techniques, and

100
00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:07.520
that is supervised versus
unsupervised approaches.

101
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.900
In supervised approaches the target,

102
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.830
which is what the model is predicting,
is provided.

103
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.750
This is referred to as having labeled
data because the target is labeled for

104
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.457
every sample that you
have in your data set.

105
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.520
Referring back to our example of
predicting a weather category of sunny,

106
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.940
windy, rainy or cloudy,

107
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.550
every sample in the data set is labeled
as being one of these four categories.

108
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.910
So the data is labeled and predicting the
weather categories is a supervised task.

109
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.740
In general, classification and
regression are supervised approaches.

110
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.200
In unsupervised approaches
on the other hand,

111
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.440
the target that the model is
predicting is unknown or unavailable.

112
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.320
This means that you have unlabeled data.

113
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.130
Going back to our cluster analysis
example of segmenting customers into

114
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.400
different groups.

115
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.180
The samples in your data are not
labeled with the correct group.

116
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.250
Instead, the segmentation is performed
using a clustering technique to group

117
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.660
items based on characteristics
that they have in common.

118
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.560
Thus, the data is unlabeled and

119
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.630
the task of grouping customers into
different segments is an unsupervised one.

120
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.606
In general, cluster analysis and

121
00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:21.751
association analysis
are unsupervised approaches.

122
00:07:23.962 --> 00:07:24.534
In summary,

123
00:07:24.534 --> 00:07:29.000
in this lecture we looked at the different
categories of machine learning techniques.

124
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.210
We discussed classification, regression,
cluster analysis and association analysis.

125
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.370
We also defined what supervised and

126
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:39.590
unsupervised approaches are,
in machine learning.
