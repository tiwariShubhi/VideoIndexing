00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.660
If you recall, we have previously
discussed that the main categories of

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.170
machine learning tasks are classification,
regression,

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.560
cluster analysis, and
association analysis.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.100
We have discussed
classification in detail.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.190
Now let's look at the other categories,
starting with regression.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
After this video you will be able
to define what regression is,

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.870
explain the difference between
regression and classification, and

8
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.630
name some applications of regression.

9
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.410
Before we talk about regression,
let's review classification.

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.630
In a classification problem the input
data is presented to the machine learning

11
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.450
model, and the task is to predict the
target corresponding to the input data.

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.960
The target is a categorical variable.

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.132
So the classification task is to
predict the category or label of

14
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.450
the target, given the input data.

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.870
The classification example shown
here is one we have seen before.

16
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.950
The input variables are measurements
such as temperature, relative humidity,

17
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.790
atmospheric pressure,
wind speed, wind direction, etc.

18
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.500
The task for

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.590
the model is to predict the weather
category associated with the input data.

20
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.730
The possible values for

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.180
the weather category is sunny,
windy, rainy, or cloudy.

22
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.265
Since we're predicting the category,
this is a classification task.

23
00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:31.080
With that context in mind,
let's now discuss regression.

24
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.220
When the model has to predict
a numeric value instead of a category,

25
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.410
then the task becomes
a regression problem.

26
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.170
An example of regression is to
predict the price of a stock.

27
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.415
The stock price is a numeric value,
not a category.

28
00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:49.455
So this is a regression task
instead of a classification task.

29
00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:53.755
Note that if you were to predict not
the actual price of the stock, but whether

30
00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:58.505
the stock price will go up or go down,
then that would be a classification task.

31
00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:02.085
That is the main difference between
classification and regression.

32
00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:05.120
In classification,
you're predicting a category, and

33
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.270
in regression you're
predicting a numeric value.

34
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.810
Here are some examples where
regression can be used.

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.610
Forecast the high temperature for the next
day, estimate the average housing price

36
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.640
for a particular region, determine the
demand for a new product, a new book for

37
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.980
example, based on similar existing
products, predict the power usage for

38
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.160
a particular power grid.

39
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.780
This is what the data
set might look like for

40
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.190
the regression task of predicting
tomorrow's high temperature.

41
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.340
The input variables could
be the high temperature for

42
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.940
today, the low temperature for
today, and the month.

43
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.270
And the target is the high temperature for
tomorrow.

44
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.220
The model has to predict this
target value for each sample.

45
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.250
Recall that in a supervised
task the target is provided.

46
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.070
Well, for an unsupervised task the target
is not available or not known.

47
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.540
Since the target label is provided for
each sample here,

48
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.370
the regression task is a supervised one,
similar to classification.

49
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.580
As with classification building a
regression model also involve two phases.

50
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.330
A training phase in which
the model is built, and

51
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.410
a testing phase in which
the model is applied to new data.

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.550
The model is built using training data and
evaluated on test data.

53
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.011
Similar to classification, the goal in
building a regression model is also to

54
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:31.340
have a model perform well on training
data, as well as generalize to new data.

55
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.190
The use of three different datasets
that we have previously discussed

56
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.470
also apply to regression.

57
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.650
Recall that the three
datasets are used as follows.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.130
The training dataset is used to train the
model, that is to adjust the parameters of

59
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.408
the model to learn the input
to output mapping.

60
00:03:48.408 --> 00:03:53.380
The validation dataset is used to
determine when training should stop

61
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.700
in order to avoid over fitting.

62
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.320
And the test dataset is used to evaluate
the performance of the model on new data.

63
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.900
In summary, in regression the model
needs to predict the numeric value

64
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.970
corresponding to the input data.

65
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.160
Since a target is provided for each
sample, regression is a supervised task.

66
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.990
The target is always a numerical
variable in regression.

67
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.042
In the next lecture,

68
00:04:18.042 --> 00:04:21.323
we will discuss a specific algorithm
to build a regression model.
