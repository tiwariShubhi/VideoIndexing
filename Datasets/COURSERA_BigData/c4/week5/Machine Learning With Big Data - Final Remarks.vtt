00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.540
We studied the machine learning process,
applied techniques to explore and

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.910
prepare data, discussed the different
categories of machine learning tasks,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.200
looked at metrics and
methods for evaluating a model,

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.020
learned how to use scalable machine
learning algorithms for big data problems,

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.469
and worked with two widely used tools to
construct the machine learning models.

6
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.040
I hope that the lectures, along with
the hands-on activities, have given you

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.680
a sound and practical introduction to
machine learning tools and techniques.

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.010
I also hope that the course piqued
your interest in the exiting and

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.960
rapidly developing field of
machine learning for big data.

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.630
Keep in mind that the best
way to learn machine learning

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.600
is to do machine learning.

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.470
So I encourage you to go out and find
a problem or data set that interest you.

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.800
Apply the techniques you've learned in
this course to it and start analyzing.

14
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.110
Thank you for your time and effort on
this course, happy machine learning.
