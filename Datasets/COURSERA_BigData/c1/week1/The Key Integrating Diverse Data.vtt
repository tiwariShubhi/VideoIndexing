00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.542
The key, integrating diverse data.

2
00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:16.267
Whatever your big data application is, and

3
00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:21.527
the types of big data you are using
the real value will come from integrating

4
00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:26.056
different types of data sources,
and analyzing them at scale.

5
00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:28.947
So how do we start getting this value?

6
00:00:28.947 --> 00:00:30.706
Sometimes, all it takes,

7
00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:35.620
is looking at the data you already
collect in a different way.

8
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.060
And it can mean a big difference
in your return on investment.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.970
This new story from June 2015
mentions that Carnival Cruises

10
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.760
is using structured and unstructured
data from a variety of sources.

11
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.200
Carnival turns it into profit

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.640
using price optimization
techniques on the integrated data.

13
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.460
For you to achieve such a success story,

14
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.030
you will need to include data
integration into your big data practice.

15
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.950
However, there are some unique challenges
when attempting to integrate these

16
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.120
diverse data sources and
scaling the solutions.

17
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.220
Course Two on on the specialization,
we'll teach you more about these issues.

18
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.010
But let's take a moment to define why
effect of data integration is useful?

19
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.040
Data integration means bringing
together data from diverse sources and

20
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.170
turning them into coherent and
more useful information.

21
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.390
We also call this knowledge.

22
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.970
The main objective here is taming or
more technically managing data and

23
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.520
turning it into something you can
make use of programmatically.

24
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.460
A data integration process
involves many parts.

25
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.250
It starts with discovering,
accessing, and monitoring data and

26
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.340
continues with modeling and transforming
data from a variety of sources.

27
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.160
But why do we need data
integration in the first place?

28
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.900
Let's start by focusing on
differences between big data sets

29
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.140
coming from different sources.

30
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.640
You might have flat file formatted data,
relational database data,

31
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.470
data encoded in XML or JSON,
both common for internet generated data.

32
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.170
These different formats and
models are useful

33
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.690
because they are designed to express
different data in unique ways.

34
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.560
In a way, different data formats and

35
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.100
models make big data more useful and
more challenging all at the same time.

36
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.700
When you integrate data in different
formats, you make the final

37
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.030
product richer in the number of
features you describe the data with.

38
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.300
For example,
by integrating environmental sensor and

39
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.300
camera data with geographical
information system data, such as in

40
00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.178
my wildfire prediction application,
I can use the spacial data capabilities

41
00:03:14.178 --> 00:03:19.970
with non-spacial data to more
accurately run fire simulations.

42
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.920
In the past, although we were able
to see the images of the fire

43
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.630
from mountain top cameras,
just like this image, we were still

44
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.880
not able to tell what the exact
location of the fire is automatically.

45
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.000
Now, when a fire is detected
from a mountain top camera,

46
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.640
viewsheds are used to estimate
the location of the fire.

47
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.760
This location information can
be fed into the fire simulator

48
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.070
as early as it's detected
to predict the size and

49
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.090
location of the fire in the next
hour more accurately and faster.

50
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.920
Similarly, I can use real time
data with eye curve data sets, and

51
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.940
use them all together.

52
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.520
Additionally, by bringing
the data together, and

53
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.100
providing programmable access to it, I'm
now making each data set more accessible.

54
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.020
Moreover, integration of
diverse datasets significantly

55
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.220
reduces the overall data complexity
in my data-driven product.

56
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.610
The data becomes more available for
use and unified as a system of its own.

57
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.010
One advantage of such an integration
is not often mentioned.

58
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.830
Such a streamlined and
integrated data system

59
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.550
can increase the collaboration between
different parts of your data systems.

60
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.430
Each part can now clearly see

61
00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.000
how their data is integrated
into the overall system.

62
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.860
Including the user scenarios and the
security and privacy processes around it.

63
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:16.320
Overall by integrating diverse data
streams you add value to your big data and

64
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.320
improve your business even
before you start analyzing it.

65
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.783
Next, we will focus on the dimensions
of the scalability and

66
00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:29.937
discuss how we can start tackling
some of these challenges.
