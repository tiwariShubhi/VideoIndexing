00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.540
In this short video weâ€™ll
talk about how Meltwater

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.240
helped Danone using sentiment analysis.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.600
Meltwater is a company
that helps other companies

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.100
analyze what people are saying about
them and manage their online reputation.

5
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.980
One of the case studies on their
website is about Danone baby nutrition.

6
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.358
Meltwater helped Danone to monitor
the opinions through social media for

7
00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:31.873
one of their marketing campaigns.

8
00:00:31.873 --> 00:00:35.204
They were able to measure what
was impactful and what was not,

9
00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:36.690
through such monitoring.

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.610
Meltwater also helped Danone manage
a potential reputation issue.

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.380
When a crisis occurred
related to horse DNA

12
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.320
being in some meat products across Europe.

13
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.830
While Danone was confident that they
didn't have an issue with their products,

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.730
having the information a couple of
hours before news hit the UK press.

15
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.690
Allowed them to check and

16
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.580
reassure their customers that their
products were safe to consume.

17
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.040
You can imagine millions of mothers
having been reassured and happy for

18
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.180
Danone's efforts on this.

19
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.375
This is an excellent story about how
big data helped manage public opinion.

20
00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:21.136
And I'm sure Meltwater was able to help
them to measure the opinion impact through

21
00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:22.448
social media as well.
