1
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.963
Organization-Generated Data.

2
00:00:02.963 --> 00:00:09.580
Benefits come from combining
with other data types.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.380
How are some organizations
benefiting from big data?

4
00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:31.844
Let's look at real world examples to
see the advantages these organizations

5
00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:32.800
are getting out of big data.

6
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.120
One of these companies is UPS.

7
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.650
UPS delivers 16 million shipments per day.

8
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.360
They get around 40 million
tracking requests.

9
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.900
That's huge.

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.431
An estimate of how much data UPS has
on its operations is 16 petabytes.

11
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.580
Can you guess how much money UPS can
save by reducing each driver's route

12
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.620
by just one mile?

13
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:09.113
If they can reduce distance traveled
by each truck by even one mile,

14
00:01:09.113 --> 00:01:13.830
UPS can save a whopping $50 million U.S.
per year.

15
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.010
This is where big data steps in.

16
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.610
Utilizing complex optimization
over large datasets

17
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.250
can lead to route optimizations that were
previously not visible to the company.

18
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.900
Big data, together with smart processing,

19
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.720
enables UPS to manage thousands
of route optimizations.

20
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.310
Let's travel from package
delivery to the retail domain.

21
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.870
An organization from
the retail shopping domain

22
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.760
that heavily utilizes big data is Walmart.

23
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:58.220
Walmart is a big organization that gets
250 million customers in 10,000 stores.

24
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.570
Did you know they collect 2.5
petabytes of data per hour?

25
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.699
They collect data on Twitter tweets,
local events, local weather,

26
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:19.640
in-store purchases, online clicks and

27
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.530
many other sales, customer and
product related data.

28
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.080
They use this data to find patterns
such as which products are frequently

29
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.878
purchased together, and what is the best
new product to introduce in their stores,

30
00:02:36.878 --> 00:02:41.530
to predict demand at
the particular location,

31
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.898
and to customize customer recommendations.

32
00:02:47.898 --> 00:02:50.430
Overall, by leveraging big data and

33
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.390
analytics, Walmart has maintained
its position as a top retailer.

34
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.130
UPS and Walmart examples were just two out
of a number of companies using big data.

35
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.760
Big data is producing results for
companies in all sectors.

36
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.370
Studies forecast spending on
big data technologies to go up

37
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.630
drastically in the next five years.

38
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:25.280
A study by Bane and Company
suggests that early adopters of big

39
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.650
data analytics have gained a significant
lead over the rest of the corporate world.

40
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.430
For graphics referenced here,

41
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.700
we see that companies that use
analytics are twice as likely

42
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.160
to be in the top quartile of financial
performance within their industries.

43
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.368
Five times as likely to make decisions
much faster than market peers.

44
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.180
Three times as likely to
execute decisions as intended.

45
00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.880
And twice as likely to use data very
frequently when making decisions.

46
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.610
This points to the growth and
demand of people and

47
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.450
technology centered around or
specializing in big data applications.

48
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.870
As a summary, organizations are gaining
significant benefit from integrating

49
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.920
big data practices into their culture and
breaking their silos.

50
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.080
Some major benefits to organizations are
operational efficiency, improved marketing

51
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.630
outcomes, higher profits, and
improved customer satisfaction.
