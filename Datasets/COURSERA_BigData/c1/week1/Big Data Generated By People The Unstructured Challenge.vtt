00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.485
Big Data Generated By People,
The Unstructured Challenge.

2
00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:26.471
People are generating massive amounts of
data every day through their activities on

3
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:31.405
various social media networking sites
like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

4
00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:36.655
Or online photo sharing sites like
Instagram, Flickr, or Picasa.

5
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.620
And video sharing websites like YouTube.

6
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.100
In addition an enormous amount of
information gets generated via

7
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.250
blogging and commenting,
internet searches, more via text messages,

8
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.460
email, and through personal documents.

9
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.711
Most of this data is text-heavy and
unstructured,

10
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:08.780
that is non-conforming to
a well-defined data model.

11
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.690
We can also consider this
data to be content with

12
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.630
occasionally some
description attached to it.

13
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.360
This much activity Leads
to a huge growth in data.

14
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.980
Did you know that in a single day,
Facebook users produce

15
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.550
more data than combined US
academic research libraries?

16
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.130
Let's look at some similar
daily data volume numbers

17
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.460
from some of the biggest online platforms.

18
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.790
It is amazing that some of these
numbers are in the petabyte range for

19
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.700
daily activity.

20
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.930
A petabyte is a thousand terabytes.

21
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.360
The sheer size of mostly unstructured
data generated by humans

22
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.950
brings a lot of challenges.

23
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.250
Unstructured data refers to data that does
not conform to a predefined data model.

24
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.380
So no relation model and no SQL.

25
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.190
It is mostly anything that we
don't store in a traditional

26
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.640
Relational database management system.

27
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.480
Consider a sales receipt that
you get from a grocery store.

28
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.790
It has a section for a date, a section for

29
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.690
store name, and
a section for total amount.

30
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.310
This is an example of structure.

31
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.550
Humans generate a lot of
unstructured data in form of text.

32
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.960
There's no given format to that.

33
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.180
Look at all the documents that you
have written with your hand so far.

34
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.550
Collectively, it is a bank of unstructured
data you have personally generated.

35
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.160
In fact, 80 to 90% of all data in

36
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.980
the world is unstructured and
this number is rapidly growing.

37
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.531
Examples of unstructured data generated
by people includes texts, images,

38
00:03:09.531 --> 00:03:16.190
videos, audio,
internet searches, and emails.

39
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.580
In addition to it's rapid growth
major challenges of unstructured data

40
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.768
include multiple data formats,
like webpages, images, PDFs,

41
00:03:26.768 --> 00:03:34.170
power point, XML, and other formats that
were mainly built for human consumption.

42
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:41.030
Think of it, although I can sort my
email with date, sender and subject.

43
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.690
It would be really difficult
to write a program,

44
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.430
to categorize all my email messages
based on their content and

45
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.460
organize them for me accordingly another
challenge of human generated data

46
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:01.560
is the volume and fast generation of data,
which is what we call velocity.

47
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.504
Just take a moment to study this info
graphic, and observe what happens in one

48
00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:12.728
minute on the internet, and
consider how much to contribute to it.

49
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:22.586
Moreover, confirmation of unstructured
data is often time consuming and costly.

50
00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:28.130
The costs and
time of the process of acquiring, storing,

51
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.110
cleaning, retrieving, and processing
unstructured data can add up to quite and

52
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.220
investment before we can start
reaping value from this process.

53
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.790
It can be pretty hard
to find the tools and

54
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.810
people to implement such a process and
reap value in the end.

55
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.570
As a summary,
although there is an enormous amount of

56
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.780
data generated by people,
most of this data is unstructured.

57
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.230
The challenges of working with
unstructured data should not

58
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.170
be taken lightly.

59
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:07.310
Next, we'll look at how businesses are
tackling these challenges to gain insight.

60
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.770
And thus, value out of working
with people generated data.
