Cloud Service Models: Exploration
of Choices.

2
00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:24.709
There are many levels of services that
you can get from cloud providers.

3
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.880
Any cloud computing discussion will
involve terms like application

4
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
as a service, platform as a service,
and infrastructure as a service.

5
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.660
All of these refer to business
models around using the cloud

6
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.460
with different levels of engagement and
servicing similar to rental agreements.

7
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.470
IaaS, infrastructure as a service, can be
defined as a bare minimum rental service.

8
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.630
This is like renting a truck from
a company that you can assume has hardware

9
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.978
and you do the packing of your furniture,
and drive to your new house.

10
00:01:11.118 --> 00:01:15.430
You as the user of the service install and
maintain an operating system,

11
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.400
and other applications in
the infrastructure as a service model.

12
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.180
The Amazon EC2 cloud is a good example for
this model.

13
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.940
PaaS, platform as a service,

14
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.840
is the model where a user is provided
with an entire computing platform.

15
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.130
This could include the operating system
and programming languages that you need.

16
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.440
It could extend to include the database
of your choice, or even a web server.

17
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.920
You can develop, and

18
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.150
run your own application software,
on top of these layers.

19
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.510
The Google App engine and Microsoft Azure
are two examples of this model.

20
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.770
SaaS, the software as a service model,
is the model

21
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.090
in which the cloud service provider takes
the responsibilities for the hardware and

22
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.710
software environment such as the operating
system and the application software.

23
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.720
This means you can work on using
the application to solve your problem.

24
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.848
Dropbox is a very popular
software as a service platform.

25
00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:39.205
Ultimately, the decision of which service
you want to explore is a function of

26
00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:40.460
several variables.

27
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.760
It depends on the skill level of your
team to handle computing environment,

28
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.080
development and maintenance.

29
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.010
It also depends on how you
might need to use the service.

30
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.990
You need to pick the right
service model that

31
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.520
best fits you in terms of long term goals.

32
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.610
Finally, when you're deploying a cloud
service you also have to understand

33
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.480
all the security risks, since your
data resides on third party service.

34
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.026
Security is a very important
aspect in today's world of growing

35
00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:18.207
digitization of information.

36
00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:21.990
You must make your client's
data safety a top priority,

37
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.859
and hence this should be an important
criteria in your decision.

38
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.870
All the security risks
must be understood and

39
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.000
evaluated as your data resides
on third party servers.

40
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.370
We are seeing other forms
of services being added

41
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.080
to the family of cloud services.

42
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.710
The logic of infrastructure, platform, and

43
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.550
Software as a Service is
getting extended further.

44
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.580
XaaS is an umbrella term that signifies

45
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.980
even finer-grain control over computing
resources that you want to rent.

46
00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.520
For example, storage as a service,
communication as a service,

47
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.410
marketing as a service, and so on.

48
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:14.370
As a summary, infrastructure as a service,
platform as a service, and application

49
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.800
as a service are three main class service
models that are being used with success.

50
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:25.788
Picking one will depend on the number
of variables which are company's goals.

51
00:04:25.788 --> 00:04:28.840
These three models have
inspired many similar models

52
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.880
to emerge around cloud computing.
