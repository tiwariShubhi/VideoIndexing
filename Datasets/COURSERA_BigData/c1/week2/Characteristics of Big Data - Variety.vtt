1
00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.620
Now we'll talk about a form of
scalability called variety.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.500
In this case, scale does not
refer to the largeness of data.

3
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.398
It refers to increased diversity.

4
00:00:21.985 --> 00:00:24.450
Here is an important mantra
you need to think about.

5
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.530
When we, as data scientists, think of
data variety, we think of the additional

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.450
complexity that results from more kinds
of data that we need to store, process,

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.010
and combine.

8
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.970
Now, many years ago when I
started studying data management,

9
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.030
we always thought of data as tables.

10
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.060
These tables could be in spreadsheets or
databases or just files, but somehow

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.290
they will be modeled and manipulated
as rows and columns of of tables.

12
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.620
Now, tables are still really important and
dominant, however today a much wider

13
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.800
variety of data are collected, stored, and
analyzed to solve real world problems.

14
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.610
Image data, text data, network data,
geographic maps, computer

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.390
generated simulations are only a few of
the types of data we encounter everyday.

16
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.010
The heterogeneity of data can be
characterized along several dimensions.

17
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.990
We mentioned four such axes here.

18
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.630
Structural variety refers
to the difference in

19
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.870
the representation of the data.

20
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.600
For example, an EKG signal is very
different from a newspaper article.

21
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.630
A satellite image of wildfires from
NASA is very different from tweets

22
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.110
sent out by people who
are seeing the fire spread.

23
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.100
Media variety refers to the medium
in which the data gets delivered.

24
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.150
The audio of a speech versus
the transcript of the speech

25
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.300
may represent the same information
in two different media.

26
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.872
Data objects like news video
may have multiple media.

27
00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:03.436
An image sequence, an audio,
and closed captioned text,

28
00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:05.730
all time synchronized to each other.

29
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.160
Semantic variety is best
described two examples.

30
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.480
We often use different units for
quantities we measure.

31
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.870
Sometimes we also use qualitative
versus quantitative measures.

32
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.230
For example, age can be a number or

33
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.440
we represent it by terms like infant,
juvenile, or adult.

34
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.030
Another kind of semantic
variety comes from different

35
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.450
assumptions of conditions on the data.

36
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.510
For example, if we conduct two income
surveys on two different groups of people,

37
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.970
we may not be able to compare or

38
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.020
combine them without knowing more
about the populations themselves.

39
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.620
The variation and
availability takes many forms.

40
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.510
For one, data can be available real time,

41
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.110
like sensor data, or it can be stored,
like patient records.

42
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.430
Similarly data can be
accessible continuously, for

43
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.630
example from a traffic cam.

44
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.490
Versus intermittently, for

45
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.750
example, only when the satellite
is over the region of interest.

46
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.650
This makes a difference between what
operations one can do with data,

47
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.020
especially if the volume
of the data is large.

48
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.700
We'll cover this in more
detail in course two

49
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.049
when we explore the different genres
of data and how we model them.

50
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.470
We should not think that
a single data object, or

51
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.880
a collection of similar data objects,
will be all uniform in themselves.

52
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.040
Emails, for example, is a hybrid entity.

53
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.110
Some of this information can be a table,
like shown here.

54
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.940
Now, the body of the email
usually has text in it.

55
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.360
However, some of the text may
have ornaments around them.

56
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.370
For example,

57
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.320
the part highlighted in yellow represents
something called a markup on text.

58
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.600
We'll get to markups later in the course.

59
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.500
Emails contain attachments.

60
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.920
These are files, or embedded images,

61
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.140
or other multimedia objects
that the mailer allows.

62
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.150
This screenshot from my Outlook
shows the image of a scanned image

63
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.470
of a handwritten note.

64
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.230
When you take a collection of
all emails from your mailbox, or

65
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.360
that from an organization,
you will see that senders and

66
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.490
receivers form a communication network.

67
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.917
In 2001, there was a famous scandal around
a company called Enron that engaged in

68
00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:32.390
fraudulent financial reporting practices.

69
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.450
Their email network, partly shown here,
has been studied by data scientist to find

70
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.330
usual and unusual patterns of connections
among the people in the organization.

71
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.080
An email collection can also
have it's own semantics.

72
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.340
For example, an email cannot refer to,
that means cannot copy or

73
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.640
forward, a previous email.

74
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.170
Finally, an email server
is a real-time data source.

75
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.160
But an email repository is not.

76
00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.610
Does email, and email collections,
demonstrate significant

77
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:10.270
internal variation in structure,
media, semantics, and availability?
