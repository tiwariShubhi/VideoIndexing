00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.590
In this video, we'll talk about a new
that is usually not covered much.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.510
It's called valence.

3
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.440
Simply put Valence
refers to Connectedness.

4
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.660
The more connected data is,
the higher it's valences.

5
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.000
The term valence comes from chemistry.

6
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.800
In chemistry, we talk about core electrons
and valence electrons of an atom.

7
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.810
Valence electrons are in the outer most
shell, have the highest energy level and

8
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.960
are responsible for
bonding with other atoms.

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.560
That higher valence results in greater
boding, that is greater connectedness.

10
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.670
This idea is carried over into our
definition of the term valence

11
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.180
in the context of big data.

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.750
Data items are often directly
connected to one another.

13
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.490
A city is connected to
the country it belongs to.

14
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.030
Two Facebook users are connected
because they are friends.

15
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.340
An employee is connected
to his work place.

16
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.470
Data could also be indirectly connected.

17
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.150
Two scientists are connected,
because they are both physicists.

18
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.520
For a data collection valence measures
the ratio of actually connected data items

19
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.390
to the possible number of connections
that could occur within the collection.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.100
The most important aspect of valence

21
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.870
is that the data connectivity
increases over time.

22
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.620
The series of network graphs comes from
a social experiment where scientists

23
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.230
attending a conference were asked to meet
other scientists they did not know before.

24
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.830
After several rounds of meetings,

25
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.840
they found new connections
shown by their red edges.

26
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.500
Increase in valence can lead to emergent
group behavior in people networks,

27
00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.310
like creation of new groups and coalitions
that have shared values and goals.

28
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.770
A high valence data set is denser.

29
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.670
This makes many regular,
analytic critiques very inefficient.

30
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.350
More complex analytical methods
must be adopted to account for

31
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.490
the increasing density.

32
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.760
More interesting challenges arise due
to the dynamic behavior of the data.

33
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.170
Now there is a need to model and

34
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.480
predict how valence of a connected data
set may change with time and volume.

35
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.660
The dynamic behavior also leads to
the problem of event detection,

36
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.510
such as bursts in the local
cohesion in parts of the data.

37
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.760
And emergent behavior
in the whole data set,

38
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.570
such as increased
polarization in a community.
