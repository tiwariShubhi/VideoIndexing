00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.004
Step 3: Analyzing Data.

2
00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:15.650
Now that you have your
data nicely prepared,

3
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.140
the next step is to analyze the data.

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.620
Data analysis involves building
a model from your data,

5
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.350
which is called input data.

6
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.370
The input data is used by the analysis
technique to build a model.

7
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.340
What your model generates
is the output data.

8
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.140
There are different types of problems, and

9
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.890
so there are different types
of analysis techniques.

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.424
The main categories of analysis techniques
are classification, regression,

11
00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:56.330
clustering, association analysis,
and graph analysis.

12
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.520
We will describe each one.

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.650
In classification, the goal is to
predict the category of the input data.

14
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:10.102
An example of this is predicting
the weather as being sunny,

15
00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:13.850
rainy, windy, or cloudy in this case.

16
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.820
Another example is to classify
a tumor as either benign or malignant.

17
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.270
In this case, the classification is
referred to as binary classification,

18
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.830
since there are only two categories.

19
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.660
But you can have many categories as well,

20
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.530
as the weather prediction problem
shown here having four categories.

21
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.780
Another example is to identify
handwritten digits as

22
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.860
being in one of the ten
categories from zero to nine.

23
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.310
When your model has to predict
a numeric value instead of a category,

24
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.080
then the task becomes
a regression problem.

25
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.210
An example of regression is to
predict the price of a stock.

26
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.250
The stock price is a numeric value,
not a category.

27
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.560
So this is a regression task
instead of a classification task.

28
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.020
Other examples of regression
are estimating the weekly sales of a new

29
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.740
product and
predicting the score on a test.

30
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.910
In clustering, the goal is to
organize similar items into groups.

31
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.390
An example is grouping a company's
customer base into distinct segments for

32
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.360
more effective targeted marketing
like seniors, adults and

33
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.420
teenagers, as we see here.

34
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.050
Another such example is identifying
areas of similar topography,

35
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.420
like mountains, deserts,
plains for land use application.

36
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.300
Yet another example is determining
different groups of weather patterns,

37
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.150
like rainy, cold or snowy.

38
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.740
The goal in association analysis
is to come up with a set

39
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.330
of rules to capture associations
within items or events.

40
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.935
The rules are used to determine when
items or events occur together.

41
00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:12.300
A common application of association
analysis is known as market

42
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.710
basket analysis, which is used to
understand customer purchasing behavior.

43
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.660
For example, association analysis
can reveal that banking customers

44
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.040
who have certificate of deposit accounts,
surety CDs, also

45
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.790
tend to be interested in other investment
vehicles, such as money market accounts.

46
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.000
This information can be used for
cross-selling.

47
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.140
If you advertise money market
accounts to your customers with CDs,

48
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.100
they're likely to open such an account.

49
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.150
According to data mining folklore,
a supermarket chain used association

50
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.990
analysis to discover a connection between
two seemingly unrelated products.

51
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.940
They discovered that many customers who go
to the supermarket late on Sunday night

52
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.330
to buy diapers also tend to buy beer,
who are likely to be fathers.

53
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.590
This information was then
used to place beer and

54
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.720
diapers close together and
they saw a jump in sales of both items.

55
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.760
This is the famous diaper beer connection.

56
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.090
When your data can be transformed into
a graph representation with nodes and

57
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.330
links, then you want to use graph
analytics to analyze your data.

58
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.220
This kind of data comes about when
you have a lot of entities and

59
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.150
connections between those entities,
like social networks.

60
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.111
Some examples where graph analytics can
be useful are exploring the spread of

61
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:39.780
a disease or epidemic by analyzing
hospitals' and doctors' records.

62
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.849
Identification of security threats
by monitoring social media,

63
00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.483
email and text data.

64
00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:51.015
And optimization of mobile
communications network traffic.

65
00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:56.110
And optimization of mobile
telecommunications network traffic,

66
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.690
to ensure call quality and
reduce dropped calls.

67
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.850
Modeling starts with selecting,
one of the techniques we listed

68
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.680
as the appropriate analysis technique,
depending on the type of problem you have.

69
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.690
Then you construct the model
using the data you've prepared.

70
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.210
To validate the model,
you apply it to new data samples.

71
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.960
This is to evaluate how well the model

72
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.540
does on data that was
used to construct it.

73
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.870
The common practice is to divide
the prepared data into a set of data for

74
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.170
constructing the model and
reserving some of the data for

75
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.330
evaluating the model after
it has been constructed.

76
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.740
You can also use new data prepared the
same way as with the data that was used to

77
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.060
construct model.

78
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.950
Evaluating the model depends on the type
of analysis techniques you used.

79
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.595
Let's briefly look at how
to evaluate each technique.

80
00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:52.595
For classification and regression,
you will have the correct output for

81
00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:54.655
each sample in your input data.

82
00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:56.945
Comparing the correct output and

83
00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.880
the output predicted by the model,
provides a way to evaluate the model.

84
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.150
For clustering,
the groups resulting from clustering

85
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.850
should be examined to see if they
make sense for your application.

86
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.250
For example, do the customer
segments reflect your customer base?

87
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.310
Are they helpful for
use in your targeted marketing campaigns?

88
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.170
For association analysis and

89
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:24.940
graph analysis, some investigation will be
needed to see if the results are correct.

90
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.920
For example, network traffic delays

91
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:33.220
need to be investigated to see what your
model predicts is actually happening.

92
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.830
And whether the sources of the delays
are where they are predicted

93
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.050
to be in the real system.

94
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.450
After you have evaluated your model to get
a sense of its performance on your data,

95
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.510
you will be able to
determine the next steps.

96
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.000
Some questions to consider are,
should the analysis be

97
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.340
performed with more data in order
to get a better model performance?

98
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.760
Would using different data types help?

99
00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.990
For example, in your clustering results,

100
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.070
is it difficult to distinguish
customers from distinct regions?

101
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.050
Would adding zip code
to your input data help

102
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.150
to generate finer grained
customer segments?

103
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.060
Do the analysis results suggest
a more detailed look at

104
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.900
some aspect of the problem?

105
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:19.690
For example, predicting sunny
weather gives very good results,

106
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.390
but rainy weather
predictions are just so-so.

107
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.840
This means that you should take a closer
look at your examples for rainy weather.

108
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.520
Perhaps you just need more
samples of rainy weather, or

109
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.845
perhaps there are some
anomalies in those samples.

110
00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:40.380
Or maybe there are some missing data
that needs to be included in order

111
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.440
to completely capture rainy weather.

112
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:47.037
The ideal situation would be that your
model platforms very well with respect to

113
00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:49.620
the success criteria that were determined

114
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:53.380
when you defined the problem at
the beginning of the project.

115
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.920
In that case, you're ready to
move on to communicating and

116
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.870
acting on the results that you
obtained from your analysis.

117
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.670
As a summary, data analysis involves
selecting the appropriate technique for

118
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.940
your problem, building the model,
then evaluating the results.

119
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.516
As there are different types of problems,

120
00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:16.678
there are also different
types of analysis techniques.
