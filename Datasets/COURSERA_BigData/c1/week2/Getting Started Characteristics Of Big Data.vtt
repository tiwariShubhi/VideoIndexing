00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.310
Getting started,
characteristics of big data.

2
00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:25.786
By now you have seen that big data is a
blanket term that is used to refer to any

3
00:00:25.786 --> 00:00:30.140
collection of data so large and
complex that it exceeds the processing

4
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.530
capability of conventional data
management systems and techniques.

5
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.040
The applications of big data are endless.

6
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.000
Every part of business and society
are changing in front our eyes due to that

7
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.870
fact that we now have so much more
data and the ability for analyzing.

8
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.120
But how can we characterize big data?

9
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.630
You can say, I know it when i see it.

10
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.440
But there are easier ways to do it.

11
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.030
Big data is commonly characterized
using a number of V's.

12
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.720
The first three are volume,
velocity, and variety.

13
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.580
Volume refers to the vast amounts of
data that is generated every second,

14
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.470
mInutes, hour, and
day in our digitized world.

15
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.480
Variety refers to the ever increasing
different forms that data can come in

16
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.090
such as text, images,
voice, and geospatial data.

17
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.440
Velocity refers to the speed at
which data is being generated and

18
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.980
the pace at which data moves
from one point to the next.

19
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.510
Volume, variety, and

20
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.430
velocity are the three main dimensions
that characterize big data.

21
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.790
And describe its challenges.

22
00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.410
We have huge amounts of data
in different formats, and

23
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.160
varying quality which must
be processed quickly.

24
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.470
More Vs have been introduced
to the big data community

25
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.070
as we discover new challenges and
ways to define big data.

26
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.830
Veracity and
valence are two of these additional V's we

27
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.720
will pay special attention to as
a part of this specialization.

28
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.360
Veracity refers to the biases,
noise, and abnormality in data.

29
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.680
Or, better yet, It refers to the often
unmeasurable uncertainties and

30
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.540
truthfulness and trustworthiness of data.

31
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.150
Valence refers to the connectedness
of big data in the form of graphs,

32
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.180
just like atoms.

33
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.180
Moreover, we must be sure to
never forget our sixth V, value.

34
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.890
How do big data benefit you and
your organization?

35
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.640
Without a clear strategy and

36
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.700
an objective with the value
they are getting from big data.

37
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.800
It is easy to imagine that organizations
will be sidetracked by all these

38
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.630
challenges of big data, and not be
able to turn them into opportunities.

39
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.993
Now let's start looking into the first
five of these V's in detail.
