00:00:02.992 --> 00:00:05.893
Step 2-A: Exploring Data

2
00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:23.194
After you've put together the data
that you need for your application,

3
00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:27.460
you might be tempted to immediately
build models to analyze the data.

4
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.830
Resist this temptation.

5
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.370
The first step after getting
your data is to explore it.

6
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.340
Exploring data is a part of
the two-step data preparation process.

7
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.560
You want to do some
preliminary investigation

8
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.080
in order to gain a better understanding of
the specific characteristics of your data.

9
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.620
In this step, you'll be looking for

10
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.350
things like correlations,
general trends, and outliers.

11
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.700
Without this step, you will not be
able to use the data effectively.

12
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.520
Correlation graphs can be used
to explore the dependencies

13
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.630
between different variables in the data.

14
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.910
Graphing the general trends of
variables will show you if there is

15
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.120
a consistent direction in which the values
of these variables are moving towards,

16
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.320
like sales prices going up or down.

17
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.320
In statistics, an outlier is a data point
that's distant from other data points.

18
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.256
Plotting outliers will
help you double check for

19
00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:39.698
errors in the data due to measurements.

20
00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:45.390
In some cases, outliers that are not
errors might make you find a rare event.

21
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.860
Additionally, summary statistics provide
numerical values to describe your data.

22
00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.195
Summary statistics are quantities
that capture various characteristics

23
00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:04.540
of a set of values with a single number or
a small set of numbers.

24
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.674
Some basic summary statistics
that you should compute for

25
00:02:10.674 --> 00:02:15.490
your data set are mean, median,
range, and standard deviation.

26
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.510
Mean and median are measures of
the location of a set of values.

27
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.590
Mode is the value that occurs
most frequently in your data set.

28
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.220
And range and standard deviation
are measures of spread in your data.

29
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.810
Looking at these measures will give you
an idea of the nature of your data.

30
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.340
They can tell you if there's
something wrong with your data.

31
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.957
For example, if the range of the values
for age in your data includes

32
00:02:48.957 --> 00:02:52.926
negative numbers, or
a number much greater than 100,

33
00:02:52.926 --> 00:02:57.708
there's something suspicious in
the data that needs to be examined.

34
00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.900
Visualization techniques also
provide a quick and effective, and

35
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.830
overall a very useful way to look at
data in this preliminary analysis step.

36
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.250
A heat map, such as the one shown here,

37
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.530
can quickly give you the idea
of where the hotspots are.

38
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.020
Many other different types
of graphs can be used.

39
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.320
Histograms show that
the distribution of the data and

40
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.520
can show skewness or unusual dispersion.

41
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.168
Boxplots are another type of plot for
showing data distribution.

42
00:03:38.448 --> 00:03:44.410
Line graphs are useful for seeing how
values in your data change over time.

43
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.140
Spikes in the data are also easy to spot.

44
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.070
Scatter plots can show you
correlation between two variables.

45
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.900
Overall, there are many types
of graph to visualize data.

46
00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:02.030
They are very useful in helping
you understand the data you have.

47
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.720
In summary, what you get by
exploring your data is a better

48
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.510
understanding of the complexity of
the data you have to work with.

49
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.418
This, in turn,
will guide the rest of your process.
