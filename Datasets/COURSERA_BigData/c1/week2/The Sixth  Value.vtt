00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:06.640
The Sixth V, Value.

2
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.970
In this module,

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.160
we described the five ways which are
considered to be dimensions of big data.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.947
Each way presented a challenging
dimension of big data namely,

5
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:25.500
size, complexity, speed,
quality, and connectedness.

6
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.850
Although we can list some other rays base
on the context, we prefer to list these

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.490
five s fundamental dimensions that this
big data specialization helps you work on.

8
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.940
However, at the heart of
the big data challenge

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
is turning all of the other dimensions
into truly useful business value.

10
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.640
The idea behind processing all
this big data in the first place

11
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
is to bring value to the problem at hand.

12
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.230
In week two we will explore how
to take the first steps into

13
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.270
starting to generate
value out of big data.

14
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.465
Now that we saw all the ways, let's focus
on an example of a big data challenge.

15
00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:16.940
Let's imagine now that you're part
of a company called Eglence Inc.

16
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.992
One of the products of Eglence Inc
is a highly popular mobile game

17
00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:25.506
called Catch the Pink Flamingo.

18
00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:30.046
It's a multi-user game where
the users have to catch special types

19
00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:34.188
of pink flamingos that randomly
pop up on the world map on their

20
00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:38.670
screens based on the mission
that gets updated randomly.

21
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.120
The game is played by millions of
people online throughout the world.

22
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.110
One of the goals of the game is to form
a network of players to collectively

23
00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.470
cover the world map with pink flamingo
sightings and compete other groups.

24
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.670
Users can pick their groups
based on player stats.

25
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.530
The game's website sends free
cool stuff to registered users.

26
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.483
Registration requires users to enter
demographic information such gender,

27
00:02:07.483 --> 00:02:12.542
year of birth, city, highest education,
and things like that.

28
00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:17.675
However, most of the users enter
inaccurate information about themselves,

29
00:02:17.675 --> 00:02:20.140
just like most of us do.

30
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.980
To help improve the game,
the game collects realtime usage activity

31
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.740
data from each player and
feeds them to it's data servers.

32
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.290
The players of this game are
enthusiastically active on social media,

33
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.480
and have strong
associations with the game.

34
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.424
A popular Twitter hashtag for
this game is, CatchThePinkFlamingo,

35
00:02:43.424 --> 00:02:48.780
which gets more than 200,000
mentions worldwide per day.

36
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.695
There are strong communities of
users who meet via social media and

37
00:02:53.695 --> 00:02:55.984
get together to play the game.

38
00:02:55.984 --> 00:03:02.960
Now, imagine yourself as the big data
solutions architect for Fun Games Inc.

39
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.640
There are definitely examples of all three
types of data sources in this example.

40
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.510
The mobile app generates data for
the analysis of user activity.

41
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.407
Twitter conversations of players form
a rich source of unstructured data from

42
00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:19.005
people.

43
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:20.191
And the customer and

44
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:24.250
game records are examples of data
that this organization collects.

45
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.010
This is a challenging big data example

46
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.680
where all characteristics of
big data are represented.

47
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.240
There are high volumes of player, game and

48
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.560
Twitter data,
which also speaks to the variety of data.

49
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.465
The data streams from the mobile app,
website, and

50
00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:48.979
social media in real-time, which can
be defined as high velocity data.

51
00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.203
The quality of demographic data
users enter is not clear, and

52
00:03:53.203 --> 00:03:58.334
there are networks of players which
are related to the balance of big data.
