1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.910
Next, we'll count the number of
vertices and edges, define a min and

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.140
max function for Spark's reduce method,
computer the min and max degrees,

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.390
and compute the histogram data
of the degree of connectedness.

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.320
In this hands on,
we will cover the degree distribution of

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.810
the metros graph from
the first hands on exercise.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.110
This will help you practice finding
the degrees of connectedness in a graph.

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.310
These numbers will be used for

8
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.780
plotting the visualizations in
the next hands on exercises.

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.650
The degree of a vertex is
the number of edges or

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.810
connections the vertex has to
other vertices in the graph.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.460
In directed graphs,
each vertex has an in degree,

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.555
the number of edges
directed to the vertex.

13
00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:52.797
In and out degree, the number of
edges directed away from the vertex.

14
00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:55.580
The metros graph is an example
of a directed graph.

15
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.650
Each metropolis vertex has one
outgoing edge to a country vertex.

16
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.460
Each country vertex has one or more
incoming edges from metropolis vertices.

17
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.725
This will be a quiz question.

18
00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:20.976
Starting again where we left off from
the previous hands-on exercise, first,

19
00:01:20.976 --> 00:01:23.280
ensure your Cloudera VM is started, and

20
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.430
that you downloaded the dataset
examples of analytics.

21
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.110
The link is in the content for this week.

22
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.662
Use the numEdges attribute to print
the number of edges in metrosGraph.

23
00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.385
As you can see the result is 65,

24
00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:42.360
which matches the number of
lines in metro_country.csv.

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.178
Now use the numVertices
attribute to print the number

26
00:01:46.178 --> 00:01:48.258
of vertices in metrosGraph.

27
00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:53.344
As you can see the result is 93,
which matches the number of

28
00:01:53.344 --> 00:01:59.655
lines in metro.csv65 plus the number
of lines in country.csv, 28.

29
00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:11.061
Define the max and the min reduce
operation to compute the highest and

30
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:12.586
lowest degree vertex.

31
00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:20.725
Let us find the vertex with
the most outgoing edges or

32
00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:25.848
the vertex with the largest
out degree by passing the max

33
00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:32.065
function to a reduced operation on
the out degrees of metrosGraph.

34
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.310
The result in this case is vertex
ID five with one outgoing edge.

35
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.680
The result could have been any metropolis
because every metropolis in this graph

36
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.600
has one outgoing edge to its country.

37
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.890
Let us find the vertex with
the most incoming edges, or

38
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.620
the vertex with the largest inDegree.

39
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
This is done the same way
as the previous example,

40
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.170
except you'll run the reduce operation
on the inDegrees of metrosGraph.

41
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.350
The result is VertexId 108
with 14 incoming edges.

42
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.640
Apply a filter to the metrosGraph
vertices to find out which vertex is 108.

43
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.280
The answer is the United States.

44
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.860
This means that the United States has
14 metropolises in the metros.csvfile.

45
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.500
We can also compute how many vertices have
one out going edge by applying a filter of

46
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.530
one to the outgoing degrees and
counting the results.

47
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.160
The result is 65 because there are 65
metropolises with one outgoing degree.

48
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.520
None of the countries have
any outgoing degrees.

49
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.850
Let us ignore whether or
not the edge is in or out, and

50
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.850
just find which vertex has the most edges.

51
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.460
Again, we will run the reduce
operation with the max function.

52
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.310
But this time we will run it on
metrosGraph's degrees attribute.

53
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.960
The result is 108 again
with 14 connections.

54
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.239
This means that the United States is
the most connected vertex in metrosGraph.

55
00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:11.910
Finally, let us calculate
the histogram data of the degrees for

56
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.750
the countries in metrosGraph.

57
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.010
First, create a map that
only includes countries.

58
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.640
So create a filter to only include
the vertices with the vertex ID that is

59
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.815
greater than or equal to 100.

60
00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:27.888
Then you will group the map
by the size of the degree and

61
00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:30.430
sort the map from lowest
to highest degree.

62
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.620
The output shows six pairs in an array.

63
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.020
The first number is the number of edges,
and

64
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.810
the second number is the number of
vertices that have that number of edges.

65
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.462
In other words, the result of
the query shows that there are 18

66
00:04:48.462 --> 00:04:53.461
countries with 1 metropolis,
4 countries with 2 metropolises,

67
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:58.805
2 countries with 3 metropolises,
2 countries with 5 metropolises,

68
00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:04.260
1 country with 9 metropolises, and
1 country with 14 metropolises.
