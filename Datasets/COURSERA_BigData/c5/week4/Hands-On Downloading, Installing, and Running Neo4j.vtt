00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.690
Hello everyone and welcome to a series of
lessons on graph analytics with Neo4j.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.520
In this first tutorial we are going to go
briefly through the process of downloading

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.420
and installing Neo4j, and
then we'll go ahead and run Neo4j and

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
provide a brief review of
the Neo4j graphical interface.

5
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.713
So, let's get started.

6
00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:30.480
To download Neo4j,
you'll want to browse to neo4j.com, and

7
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.660
once you're at that URL,
you should see a webpage similar to this.

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.030
Neo4j typically will detect which
operating system you're running, but

9
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.340
if you want to download
other versions of Neo4j,

10
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.990
click this link in the upper
right-hand corner to download Neo4j.

11
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.030
We're going to use the community edition,
so we'll click this link right here.

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.950
But if you'd like to
explore other releases,

13
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.360
you can click the link down here.

14
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.760
When we click
the Download Community Edition link,

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.260
Neo4j should automatically
begin the download.

16
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.220
There are versions of Neo4j for
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.300
Neo4j is developed with the Java
programming language, so

18
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.240
you'll want to be sure you have the
minimum system requirements to run Neo4j.

19
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.220
We'll provide a link to those system
requirements in the resources of

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.750
this video.

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.000
This example is with
the Mac OS X operating system.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.829
And we've downloaded the .dmg file and
we can click to open that.

23
00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:35.037
And as is the case with the Mac
applications to install is very

24
00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:36.890
straightforward.

25
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.590
We'll just click and drag this icon
into the Applications folder and

26
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.210
that should automatically install.

27
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.820
Once the application is installed,

28
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.260
we should see it listed in
the Applications folder.

29
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.149
So let's go ahead and run Neo4j.

30
00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:58.078
To run Neo4j, you'll just double-click
on the application's icon.

31
00:01:58.078 --> 00:02:02.770
Neo4j is browser-based, so
it launches a web server, and

32
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.050
it launches a URL specific to Neo4j.

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.520
So to activate that server
we'll click the Start button.

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.940
If it's your first time using Neo4j
then you probably won't have any graph

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.890
databases available to open,
so Neo4j makes it easy for

36
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.650
you by providing a default
graph database of movie data.

37
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.534
To run Neo4j, you click this link and
that should launch your default browser.

38
00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:37.510
Installation on Windows should be
just as straightforward as OS X.

39
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.380
You'll click the same
Download Neo4j button and

40
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.900
when the download page opens,
you'll click Download Community Edition.

41
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.390
Neo4j should recognize you're running
Windows and should download an executable.

42
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.340
Once that downloads we can run it and
we'll step through the same steps

43
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.150
which are typical for
a Windows operating system.

44
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.491
Now I already have Neo4j
installed in my Windows system so

45
00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:05.161
I will be updating my
existing installation.

46
00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:12.210
And Neo4j downloads a Java jar file.

47
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.600
Once the application's installed
it will open the dialog box and

48
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.730
we can start up our web server.

49
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.200
And the same URL is available and
when we click that, our default

50
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.427
browser should be launched and we should
see the same interface we see In OS X.

51
00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:32.810
You should be able to subsequently
run neo4j by accessing the executable

52
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.890
in the Windows Start menu.

53
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.279
So let's take a look at
the neo4j interface.

54
00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:45.150
As I mentioned previously,
neo4j is a browser-based application.

55
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.135
So once the application launches it
should open your default browser and

56
00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:52.110
in my case, I'm using the Chrome browser.

57
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.250
And you should see a URL like
this in the address bar.

58
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.740
Most browsers provide a full-screen
viewing mode, so I'm going to go ahead and

59
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.560
activate that, in this case,
what Chrome calls presentation mode.

60
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.020
The interface for
neo4j consists of three main areas.

61
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.600
There's the command line along the top
where you can issue commands and you can

62
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.030
paste content into the command line and
execute multiple lines at one time.

63
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.330
You can specify these commands
to be one of your favorites.

64
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.600
You can clear the command box.

65
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.738
And you can run, or execute,
the commands with the Play button.

66
00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:33.640
On the left-hand side is an expandable and
collapsible panel that provides

67
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.830
supplementary information about the
database you're currently working with.

68
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.550
There's an option to list your favorites,
and

69
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.020
Neo4j provides an initial
default listing of favorites.

70
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.890
And there's supplementary information and
links to references and

71
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.920
examples and tutorials and so on.

72
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.990
You can also modify the configuration
of your Neo4j installation for

73
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.570
your particular user.

74
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.383
And there's additional information
about the application.

75
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:04.631
The third area is the main panel in
the middle where the results of all of

76
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:07.760
the commands that you
execute are displayed.

77
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.220
In fact, this panel itself has been
generated by issuing a command,

78
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.770
which is displayed in
the very top of the panel.

79
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.180
The command is ;play start.

80
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.160
In fact, if I type that command into my
command line I should be able to generate

81
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.088
a duplicate of that panel,
and sure enough, there it is.

82
00:05:26.088 --> 00:05:32.310
The upper right-hand corner of these
panels I can pin the panel to my webpage,

83
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.590
and I can do this with as
many panels as I want and

84
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.820
the window will simply allow
me to scroll up and down.

85
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.520
I can view this particular
panel full screen.

86
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.430
Or it can cancel or close it,
which is what I'm going to do.

87
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.530
Now you can see neo4j makes it very
easy to learn all about graph analytics.

88
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.460
So let's go ahead and get started
with learning how to create and

89
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.220
modify our first graph network.
