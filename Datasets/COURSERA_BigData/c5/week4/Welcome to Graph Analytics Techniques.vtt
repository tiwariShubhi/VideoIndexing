Hello everyone and welcome to this week's
module on graph analytics with Neo4j

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.460
using the Cypher query language.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.950
I'm Jeff Sale and I'll be your
instructor for this series of lessons.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.360
I've been an instructional designer at
the San Diego Supercomputer Center for

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.090
more than ten years, but I've also had
a passion for scientific visualization and

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.940
visual analytics in one form or
another for over two decades.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.010
And I'm very excited about this
opportunity to introduce you to this

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.590
free and very powerful graph
analytics tool called Neo4j.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.990
First we realized that many of you
may not have the systems capable of

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.190
pushing the boundaries of
Neo4j's performance limits.

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.620
Plus the fact that many of you are fitting
this course into your already busy

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.680
schedules means we'll be working with data
sets, which will load into Neo4j and can

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.690
be analyze in a reasonable length of time,
on the order of minutes not hours or days.

14
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.020
However you can be sure that Neo4j
is capable of processing and

15
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
analyzing extremely complex graph networks
consisting of millions of nodes and

16
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.360
relationships.

17
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.650
This module consists of a series of
hands-on demonstrations with Neo4j,

18
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.780
which begin with examples of
some basic cypher queries

19
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.590
that soon progress to some of
the more advanced cypher queries.

20
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.440
We'll begin by using a relatively simple
graph representing a road network, but

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.260
we'll also use much larger and
more complex data sets,

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.280
including sociological data on
global terrorist groups and

23
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.340
genetics data on associations and
interactions between genes.

24
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.910
These data sets are in fact sub
sets of much larger data sets and

25
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.290
we're making both of the sub sets and
complete data sets available for download.

26
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.250
Once you become comfortable working
with the smaller data sets,

27
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760
we encourage you to explore
the larger sets on your own.

28
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.020
Finally you'll notice that each
video is accompanied by a text file

29
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.560
containing all of the code used
in the video demonstrations.

30
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.680
These files include dozens of sample
scripts, written in cypher, designed to

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.250
make it easy for you to learn, not only
basic cypher cards, but also queries which

32
00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.858
focus on more advanced methods such
pathenoids and connectivity analytics.

33
00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.690
When you're finished with this module
you'll be able to write cypher scripts to

34
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.900
import and
analyze your own data using Neo4j.

35
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.682
So thank you for
enrolling in this course and let's get

36
00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:17.991
started doing some real graph analytics
with Neo4j and the Cypher query language.
