00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.220
In the first example
of graph analytics for

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.340
big data, we'll consider
the social media called Twitter.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.320
And graphs representing tweets.

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.600
What types of objects and
relationships does a tweet have?

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.240
Well, in fact, tweets consist
of many of the same elements and

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.890
relationships as the Facebook posts.

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.380
Tweets have users, they contain text,

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.780
tweets can point to one another or
to URL's, they have hashtags, they can

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.720
include reference to various other types
of media, but what about relationships?

10
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.120
Well much like Facebook, relationships and

11
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.660
tweets are more reflective of
what the users do with tweets.

12
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.360
For example, people create tweets,
they respond to tweets,

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.030
they mention other users, and so forth.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.850
Let's look at these
relationships in detail.

15
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.600
In this graph, all of the light
blue notes are tweets, and

16
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.090
all of the purple notes are users.

17
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.930
When a specific user
creates a specific tweet,

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.240
an entity is created in
the graph as a result.

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.580
We'll come back to this graph
in the next few slides.

20
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.980
So what we want to do with it?

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.820
Well to be very specific,

22
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.480
this graph was created from tweets
of a bunch of online gamers.

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.220
In this case, we were monitoring
the tweets of all people

24
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.112
who played particular online video game.

25
00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:34.415
Typically, gamers are very
excited about their video games.

26
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.295
They're exited about their characters
of the video games and they want to

27
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:41.695
discuss the video games they're excited
about, when new versions are released.

28
00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:46.195
So what are the data
science questions here?

29
00:01:46.195 --> 00:01:50.420
People who look at these things, such as
behavioral psychologists, want to know.

30
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.420
If you are a war game user or
if you play any other violent game, where

31
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.830
there is a lot of fighting online, do
these people also show violent behavior?

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.110
Maybe they do, maybe they don't.

33
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.430
They also want to know whether as a result
of looking at somebody's tweets and

34
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.610
following them over time they can tell if
the person is addicted to the game or not.

35
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.190
So why use graphs for that?

36
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.850
One of the things you could
do is what we showed here,

37
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.210
from the graphs you can extract
certain elements like conversations.

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.320
If you look at it, you will see all of
them have somebody posting something.

39
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.100
Somebody responding to the post, and the
first person responding to the response.

40
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.390
They are retweeting, and
they are responding, and so forth.

41
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.478
You would see a conversation chain
going on which can be short or long,

42
00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.940
like you see, and
other people would join in.

43
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.140
We don't know if it's violent or not, but

44
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.909
at least there is a lively
conversation going on about something.

45
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.870
Using graphs, we could find some
meaningful parts of a graph

46
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.600
that we can further analyze using
techniques like text analytics.

47
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.870
Another kind of thing people
would like to identify,

48
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.170
is which players are interacting
with which other players?

49
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.580
Who are these people?

50
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.550
Do they form a close community?

51
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.470
Can anybody join in?

52
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.060
Are there groups, what are the groups?

53
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.870
If you find a group,
who are the most influential users?

54
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.740
Who are the people that everybody
refers to, listens to and so on?

55
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.989
Graph analytics is used to answer all
these questions about a conversation

56
00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.467
that's going on live in
social media stream.

57
00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:37.681
Let's look at our next example.
