1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.600
Our third use case is about
the human information network.

2
00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.870
That means a personal information network.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.680
The graphic you see there
is my LinkedIn network.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.060
Everybody who is on my LinkedIn is a node.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.500
And if they know each other,
there's an edge between them.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.880
You can possibly see some groups or
clusters there.

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.240
One analytical question
we'll explore in module two

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.440
is how to discover these
groups automatically.

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.310
Now of course with LinkedIn we only
have professional information.

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.130
But it is prudent to ask whether

11
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.340
one can integrate the professional network
with other forms of personal information.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.440
This would be other social media data like
my friendship network from Facebook or

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.230
Google, or it could be information
like my Outlook email network.

14
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.060
One can add even more information and
put that interpersonal relationships.

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.490
For example, Professor Norman who is
on my contact list is my director.

16
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.860
And if we add my calendar to this,

17
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.980
one can find events that I'll be attending
and people that I will be meeting.

18
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.431
Taking it even further, for

19
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:19.949
special applications you might
actually include financial and

20
00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:24.956
business transactions, or
performance in activities,

21
00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:29.671
or fitness information, or
the location from my GPS.

22
00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:36.360
Now, if you add all of these questions, we
should ask what we do with these things?

23
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.920
Let's see.

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.910
One use of this kind of
information is matching.

25
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.960
For example, matching people with jobs
is not just a matter of screening

26
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.840
series based on job descriptions or
evaluating their job experience.

27
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.890
To recruit for high level positions,
like the board of directors of a company,

28
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.210
you need to evaluate the network of the
candidate to determine their relationships

29
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.850
with important organizations,
groups, and individuals.

30
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.900
For some tasks like choosing a surgeon,

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.230
you might also want inspect
their social media ratings.

32
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.830
In other classic applications,
we might want to look for

33
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.630
people who can influence a human network.

34
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.960
Suppose, we are in an election
campaign team, and

35
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.620
need our message to get to as many
people as possible in a city.

36
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.800
We can not go door to door ourselves,
we need to go to some people, and

37
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.360
these people will reach
others on our behalf.

38
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.150
Graph analytic techniques may help
identify the fewest number of people

39
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.610
who will have maximal reach into most
of the potential voters in the city.

40
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.250
A third category of application
is threat detection.

41
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.076
This network is created
by groups who study news.

42
00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:59.390
For example,
they collect information about all

43
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.670
the militant groups in different countries
and all the reported acts of terrorism.

44
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.460
This creates a network as you can see.

45
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.266
We show only a part of the network.

46
00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:14.203
In this graph view,
the green notes are groups and

47
00:03:14.203 --> 00:03:17.406
the pink notes are deemed individuals.

48
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.920
It should be clear that some
of these individuals and

49
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.050
groups are more closely
associated than others.

50
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.057
Discovering and tracking these groups,
their current activities,

51
00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:33.685
together with an analysis of details of
the events they're associated with might

52
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:36.904
help analysts to get deeper
insight into the networks and

53
00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:39.604
perhaps anticipate their
future activities.
