00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.620
So, in this optional module, we'll look
at the two key player problems again.

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.178
The goal of the first problem is
to identify a small set of nodes,

3
00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:15.120
whose removal will create
maximum disruption.

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.540
Now, in this case, a traditional
centrality algorithm may not work,

5
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.310
because the optimization goal
is to break up the network.

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.810
So we need a quantitive
measure of the breakage.

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.980
If dij is the distance between nodes i and

8
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.920
j, then 1 over dij is
the closeness of these two nodes.

9
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.980
If we add the closeness of all nodes and
normalize it by the number of node pairs,

10
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.150
we'll get a measure of
cohesiveness as a fraction.

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.070
So, 1 minus this value is
a measure of fragmentation.

12
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.880
Our goal is to maximize
this fragmentation metric.

13
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.599
In the model terrorist network shown here,
removing the red nodes A,

14
00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:11.530
B, and C will break up the network
into seven components,

15
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.669
with F reaching a value of 0.59.

16
00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:20.026
The second key player problem, is trying
to find a group of S influencers,

17
00:01:20.026 --> 00:01:24.120
which can reach a maximum
number of nodes within K steps.

18
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.850
The number of unique nodes reachable from
a starting node is called the reach,

19
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.510
of the starting node.

20
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.420
For this we need to adapt the concept
of reach to limit it to k steps.

21
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.570
We also need to adapt it to measure
the distance of an arbitrary node

22
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.891
from a group of nodes
between our influences.

23
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.120
The distance from one node to a group
of nodes can be defined as a maximum,

24
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.100
or average, or minimum distance,
of the node from the members of the group.

25
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.530
Often, the minimum
distance is a good choice.

26
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.400
So the distance, we could reach,

27
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.280
can then be through of, as the proportion
of all nodes reached by the group,

28
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.810
where the nodes are weighted
by the distance from the set.

29
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.630
And only nodes at distance
1 are given full rate.

30
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.270
Hence, a distance we could reach
that use a maximum value of 1,

31
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.730
where every outside node is adjacent to at
least one member of the set of influences.

32
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.340
In the network shown,
just three nodes, A, C, and D,

33
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.340
are sufficient to reach every other
member within just four steps.

34
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.150
Now this concludes this module, where we
looked at several analytic techniques and

35
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.090
measures to extract different
kinds of insights from a network.
