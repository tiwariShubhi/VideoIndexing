00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:02.670
Welcome.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.200
In this module,
we'll talk about data models.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.770
If you completed the introductory
course of this specialization,

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.940
you might recall our
video on data variety.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.840
One way to characterize data variety

6
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.290
is to identify the different models of
data that are used in any application.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.480
So what is a data model?

8
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.980
And why do we care about data
models in the context of big data?

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.010
In this lesson, we'll introduce you to
three components of a data model and

10
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.380
what they tell us about the data.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.620
So after this lesson, you'll be able
to distinguish between structured and

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.270
unstructured data.

13
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.880
Describe four basic data operations namely
selection, projection, union, and join.

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.120
And enumerate different types of data
constraints like type, value and

15
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.240
structural constraints.

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.760
You'll also be able to explain why
constraints are useful to specify

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.320
the semantics of data.

18
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.980
Now, regardless of whether the data is big
or small, one needs to know or determine

19
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.100
the characteristics of data before one can
manipulate or analyze them meaningfully.

20
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.320
Let's use a simple example,
suppose you have data is

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.330
a file of records with fields called first
name, last name and date of birth of

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.840
the employees in the company that this
file consists of records with fields,

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.290
and not for instance plain text,
gives us more insight

24
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.770
into the organization of the data in the
file and hence is part of the data model.

25
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.810
This aspect is called Structure.

26
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.930
Similarly, the consideration
that we can perform

27
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.980
data arithmetic with
the date of birth field, and

28
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.340
not with the first name field, is also
part of our understanding of data model.

29
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.620
These are called Operations.

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.300
Finally, we may know that in
this company no one's age

31
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.950
that is today's date minus the date
of birth, can't be less than 18.

32
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.000
So it gives us a way to detect records
with blatantly erroneous dates of birth.

33
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.940
In the following three videos,

34
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.790
we'll look at these three aspects
of data models more carefully.
