00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.950
In the big data world, we often hear the
term structured data, that is, data having

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.490
a structure which is quite different
from the so-called unstructured data.

3
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.500
But what is a structure?

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.040
Let's consider file 1.

5
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
It's a typical CSV file that has
three lines with different content.

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.260
But the file content is uniform
in the sense that each line,

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.400
call it a record,
has exactly three fields,

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.360
which we sometimes call data properties or
attributes.

9
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.420
Further, the first two of these fields
are strings and the third one is a date.

10
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.770
We can add more records, that's
lines with the same pattern of data,

11
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.210
to the file in the same fashion.

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.430
The content will grow, but the pattern of
data organization will remain identical.

13
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.600
This repeatable pattern of data
organization makes the file structured.

14
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.870
Now let's look at file 2,
which is four records of five fields each,

15
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.680
except that the third record seems
to be missing the last entry.

16
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.660
Is this file structured?

17
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.383
We argue that it is, because the missing
value makes the third record incomplete,

18
00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:20.310
but it does not break the structure or
the pattern of the data organization.

19
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.088
Let's looks at these
two files side by side.

20
00:01:23.088 --> 00:01:29.320
Clearly file 2 has more fields, and hence
is sort of wider than the first file.

21
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.980
Would you say that they
have the same structure?

22
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.990
Well, on the face of it they don't.

23
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.740
But if you think more broadly,

24
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.260
you would notice that they
are both collection of k fields.

25
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.770
The size of the collection,
respectively three and four, differs.

26
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.320
And k is 3 in the first case and
5 in the second.

27
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.330
But we can think of 3 and 5 as parameters.

28
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.280
In that case, we will say that these
files have been generated by a similar

29
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.160
organizational structure, and
hence they have the same data model.

30
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.190
Now in contrast, consider this file.

31
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.480
Just looking at it, it's impossible to
figure out how the data is organized and

32
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.420
how to identify subparts of the data.

33
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.850
We would call this data unstructured.

34
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.605
Often, compressed data like JPEG images,
MP3 audio files,

35
00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:26.450
MPEG3 video files, encrypted data,
are usually unstructured.

36
00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.098
In module two, we'll elaborate on data
models that are not fully structured or

37
00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:33.900
are structured differently.
