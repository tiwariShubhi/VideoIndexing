00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.740
Okay we in essence store
the data efficiently.

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.670
But is it any good?

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.970
Are there ways of knowing if the data is
potentially error free and useful for

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.770
the intended purpose?

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.500
This is the issue of data quality.

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.300
There are many reasons
why any data application,

7
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.470
especially larger applications need
to be mindful of data quality.

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.650
Here are three reasons, of course
there are more that we do not mention.

9
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.480
The first reason emphasizes that
the ultimate use of big data

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.040
is its ability to give
us actionable insight.

11
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.030
Poor quality data leads to poor
analysis and hence to poor decisions.

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.820
The second related data in regulated
industries in areas like clinical

13
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.710
trials for pharmaceutical companies or
financial data like from banks.

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.440
Errors in data in these industries
can regulate regulations leading to

15
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.290
legal complications.

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.230
The third factor is different
than the first two.

17
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.620
It says if your big data should
be used by other people or

18
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.290
a third party software
it's very important for

19
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.059
the data to give good quality to
gain trust as a leader provider.

20
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.270
A class of big data applications
is scientific, where large,

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.180
integrated collections of data
are created by human experts to

22
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.570
understand scientific questions.

23
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.960
Ensuring accuracy of data will lead
to correct human engagement and

24
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.220
interaction with the data system.

25
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.170
Gartner, the well known
technology research and

26
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.720
advising company created a 2015
industry report on big data qualities.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.240
In this report,
they identify the approaches to meeting

28
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.210
the data quality requirements
in the industry.

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.690
This methods include the adherence
to standards where applicable.

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.150
It also refers to the need to
create the rules in the data system

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.870
that can be use to check if the data
passes a set of correct this qualities.

32
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.950
Like is even employed above 18.

33
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.490
It also includes methods to clean
the data if it's found to have errors or

34
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.260
inconsistencies.

35
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.772
Further the data quality management should
include a well define work flow on how

36
00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:19.690
low quality data could be corrected to
bring it back to a high level of quality.
