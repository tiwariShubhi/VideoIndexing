00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:06.100
At this point, you hopefully have a good
general idea of what big data means and

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.380
why big data is important.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.190
So now, we need to focus on what to do

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.090
when we have an application
that uses big data.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.780
In this video, we focus on
the problem of managing big data.

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.970
So at the end of the video,

7
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.390
you should be able to describe what data
management means in general, and then

8
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.180
specifically recognize the issues that are
involved in the management of big data.

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.620
First, let's see what data
management means in general.

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.120
Instead of giving you
definitions of data management,

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.760
let's think of some questions
that must be asked and

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.880
answered well if you're to manage
a reasonable amount of data.

13
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.350
Now, we can not possibly cover
all questions one should ask for

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.020
a data-centric application, but here are
some important ones, which range from how

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.290
we get the data, to how we work with it,
to how we secure it from malicious users.

16
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.386
We'll visit these issues one at a time.
