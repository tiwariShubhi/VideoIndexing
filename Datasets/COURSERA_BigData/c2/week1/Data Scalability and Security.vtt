00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.770
There are many ways of
looking at scalability.

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.600
And we'll consider them as
we go forward in the course.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.870
One way is to consider scaling up and
scaling out.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.300
Simply put,
it is a decision between making a machine

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.264
that makes a server more powerful
versus adding more machines.

6
00:00:23.264 --> 00:00:27.240
The first choice will
involve adding more memory,

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.020
replacing processes with
process of more course and

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.060
adding more processes within a system with
a very fast internet connection speed.

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.520
The second choice will involve adding more
machines to a relatively slower network.

10
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.290
Now, there are no absolutes here.

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.490
In many cases, we'll choose the former
to get more performance for

12
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.740
large leader systems.

13
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.760
The general trend in the big data world,

14
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.590
however, is to target
the scale out option.

15
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.950
Most big data management systems today

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.140
are designed to operate over
a cluster up machines and

17
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.490
have the ability to adjust as more
machines are added and when machines fail.

18
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.060
Cluster management and management
of data operations over a cluster

19
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.930
is an important component in today's
big data management systems.

20
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.990
Now we'll briefly touch upon
the complex issue of data security.

21
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.700
It is obvious that having more sensitive
data implies the need for more security.

22
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.650
If the data is within
the walls of an organization,

23
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.180
we'll still need a security plan.

24
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.700
However, if a big data system
is deployed in the cloud,

25
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.900
over multiple machines, security of
data becomes an even bigger challenge.

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.800
So now we need to ensure the security for
not only the machines,

27
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.880
but also the network which will be
heavily used during data transfer

28
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.610
across different phases
of data operations.

29
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.200
For example, if the data store and
the data analysis are performed over

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.760
different sets of servers that
every analysis operation gets to

31
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.630
an additional overhead of encrypting the
data as the data gets to the network and

32
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.030
decrypting when it gets
to the processing server.

33
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.880
This effectively increases
operational cost.

34
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.050
As of today, while there are many
security products, the methods for

35
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.290
ensuring security and achieving data
processing efficiency at the same time

36
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620
remains a research issue
in big data management.
