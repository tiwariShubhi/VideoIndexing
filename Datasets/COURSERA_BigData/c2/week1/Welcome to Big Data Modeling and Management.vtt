00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.780
Welcome to course two of
the big data specialization.

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.390
I'm Amarnath Gupta.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.270
>> And I'm Ilkay Altintas.

4
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.830
We are really excited to work
with you in this course,

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.820
to develop your understanding and skills
in big data modeling and management.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.470
You might have just finished our first
course, and see the potential and

7
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.570
challenges of big data.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.630
If you haven't it's not required but for

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.510
those with less background in
the area you might find it valuable.

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.070
>> Let's explain what we mean by
big data modeling and management.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.470
Suppose you have an application
where the data is big in a sense and

12
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.470
it has a large volume, or has high speed,
or comes with a lot of variations.

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.220
Even before you think of
how to handle the bigness,

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.450
you need to have a sense of
what the data looks like.

15
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.860
The goal of data modeling is to
formally explore the nature of data, so

16
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.870
that you can figure out what
kind of storage you need, and

17
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.470
what kind of processing you can do on it.

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.010
The goal of data management
is to figure out

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.840
what kind of infrastructure support
you would need for the data.

20
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.130
For example, does your environment need
to keep multiple replicas of the data?

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.454
Do you need to do statistical
computation with the data?

22
00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:23.120
Once these operational requirements,
you'll

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.110
be able to choose the right system that
will let you perform these operations.

24
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.200
>> We will also introduce
management of big data as it is

25
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.530
streaming from data sources and talk
about storage architectures for big data.

26
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.790
For example,
how can high velocity data get ingested,

27
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.360
managed, stored in order to enable
real time analytical capabilities.

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.560
Or what is the difference between
data at rest and data in motion?

29
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.230
And how can a data system enable both?

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.680
>> Once you've understood the basic
concepts of data modeling,

31
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.300
data management, and streaming data,
we will introduce you

32
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.120
to the characteristics of large volume
data and how to think about that.

33
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.080
Thus, we will transition from
classical database management systems,

34
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.730
that is DBMSs,
to big data management systems, or BDMSs.

35
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.000
We'll present brief overviews of
several big data management systems

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.430
available in the marketplace today.

37
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.310
We are so excited to show you examples
of archived and streaming big data sets.

38
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.500
Our goal is to provide you with simple
hands on exercises that require

39
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.290
no programming, but show you what
big data looks like, and why various

40
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.030
big data management systems are suitable
for specific kinds of big data.

41
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510
In the end you will be
able to design a simple

42
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.110
big data information system
using this knowledge.

43
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.280
We wish you a fun time learning and

44
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.540
hope to hear from you in the discussion
forums and learner stories.

45
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.529
>> Happy learning and think big data.
