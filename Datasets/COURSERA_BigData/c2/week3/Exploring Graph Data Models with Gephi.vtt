00:00:01.851 --> 00:00:05.973
In this hands-on activity,
we will be looking at graph data in Gephi.

2
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:10.510
First, we will import data into Gephi and
then examine the properties of the graph.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.160
Next, we will perform some statistical
operations on the graph data,

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.750
and then run some different
layout algorithms.

5
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.585
Let's begin.

6
00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:26.370
We're not running Gephi in the Cloudera
virtual machine, on the Coursera website,

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.450
there will be a reading with instructions
on how to download, install, and

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.050
run Gephi on your native hardware,
instead of in the virtual machine.

9
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.693
Once you have Gephi started,
let's import the data into Gephi.

10
00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:46.908
We'll go to File Import spreadsheet,
and in the CSV dialog,

11
00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:52.338
we'll click the button with dot, dot, dot.

12
00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:57.679
We'll choose diseasegraph.csv and
click open.

13
00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:06.420
Make sure that as table says
edges table Click next.

14
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.535
And make sure Create
missing nodes is checked.

15
00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:17.215
We'll click finish to import
the CSV file as a graph.

16
00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.630
Gephi now shows the graph
in the center pane.

17
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.930
The little black circles
are the nodes of the graph and

18
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.500
the lines between them are the edges.

19
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.707
In the top right we can see that
there are 777 nodes and 998 edges.

20
00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:36.380
Next let's perform some statistical
operations on this graph.

21
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.145
In the statistics pane we
can see average degree.

22
00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:44.980
Let's compute the average degree
of the graph by clicking on Run.

23
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.260
This says that the average
degree is 2.569.

24
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.693
Let's close this,
let's compute the connected

25
00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:02.583
components, we'll click on Run.

26
00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.400
We'll leave this as a directed,
since the graph is directed.

27
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.930
Click OK.
It says that there

28
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.940
are 5 weakly connected components,
and 761 strongly connected components.

29
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.400
Let's close this.

30
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.710
Next, let's run some different
layout algorithms over the graph.

31
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.760
The bottom left,
we'll go to choose layout.

32
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.019
We'll choose Force Atlas and click run.

33
00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:52.080
Click stop to stop the layout.

34
00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:58.200
We can see that Gephi has grouped
strongly connected components together

35
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.320
in different clusters.

36
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.920
We can also see that they're parts
of the graph that are not connected.

37
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.830
Let's run a different layout algorithm.

38
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.395
The combo box,
choose Fruchterman Reingold, click run.

39
00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:23.125
After it runs for a few seconds, click
stop, then click the magnifying glass,

40
00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.680
center on graph, to see the whole graph.

41
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.700
In this layout,
all the nodes appear to be equally spaced.

42
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.537
But we can also see
the nodes with many edges.
