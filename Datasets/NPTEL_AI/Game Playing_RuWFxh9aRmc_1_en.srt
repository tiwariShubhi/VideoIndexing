1
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:27,910
Today, we want to move on to a different topic,
which is, games.

2
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:37,259
Now game playing has
fascinated computer scientist ever since,

3
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,729
the beginning of computing time.

4
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:48,719
Von Newman
was the first person to talk about chess playing

5
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,750
programs, and we have discussed in the
introduction that Alex Bernstein wrote a program

6
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,478
in the early 50’s, and Samuel wrote a
program to play checkers, and so on and so

7
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,320
forth.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:14,329
Essentially why do we like games?

9
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:23,120
You can say games, we like, because they have
well defined rules.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,060
If you solve real
problems in the real world, if you want solve

11
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:32,159
computer vision and natural language
processing, or let us say, TSP, and things

12
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,280
like that; some of the problems, TSP is well
defined, but some of the other problems are

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,540
not so well defined, essentially; the real
world problem if you are trying to solve.

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:45,810
Whereas, games have clear cut rules; it tells
you these are the moves you can make and so

15
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,700
on.

16
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:58,379
Essentially easy to evaluate, it is very
easy to decide; the rules tell you when a

17
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,289
player wins when a player loses.

18
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,010
So, it is easy to judge.

19
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:07,120
Incidentally, the kinds of games we are talking
about, these are not

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,360
.the games which are popular amongst students
where, you are shooting somebody or

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
killing somebody.

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,349
We are talking of simpler games, which are
like chess and checkers,

23
00:02:18,348 --> 00:02:27,048
and so on and so forth, essentially, but the
fact is that games, because of these two

24
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:34,299
features; they were well defined and easy
to evaluate, or always the good medium for

25
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:37,719
evaluating your reasoning algorithms or search
algorithms.

26
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:41,348
Whatever is the technique
that you are using, I mean, not only for us,

27
00:02:41,348 --> 00:02:52,539
but even in the real world, you can imagine
that if you look at our country, you will

28
00:02:52,539 --> 00:03:00,989
find the politicians there children, are
politicians, that is their only merit.

29
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:06,560
A film star has children, who become film
stars, again, that seems be their only merit.

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,248
Whereas, if you look at world of sports, children
of sports men, do not necessarily, make

31
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:14,370
it begin the world of sports, essentially.

32
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,000
Look at Sunil Gavaskar, one of the greatest
batsman we had, his son Rohan Gavaskar, could

33
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,229
barely, make it to the Indian team,
essentially.

34
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:28,578
Whereas, is if he might be a politician, he
would have been some big shot by

35
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,579
now, essentially.

36
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,079
That is because games are easy to evaluate
that you do not have bias;

37
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,959
you do not have judgment.

38
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:38,189
Somebody saying, no, this is not good and
that is good; they

39
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:42,438
have no such things; either, you win or you
lose, essentially.

40
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,438
.

41
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:46,459
Now, game playing derives some game theory.

42
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:53,030
So, what is the name when associated

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,479
.with game theory?

44
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:04,518
Who is credited with inventing this field
of game theory?

45
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,010
Not Mash,
essentially.

46
00:04:06,009 --> 00:04:11,799
Von Newman is the person, we credit with inventing
game theory, and what

47
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,480
do we mean by game theory?

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:26,800
We mean rational choice in a multi agent scenario.

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:36,908
So,
essentially, game theory is the first place

50
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,589
that we have stepped out of a single agent
situation.

51
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:44,388
So far, the algorithm that we have looked
at, search or whatever else; there was

52
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,629
a single agent, trying to solve a problem,
and you are looking at what are the approaches

53
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:49,629
solve that problem.

54
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,789
In game theory, we first time, introduce more
than one player, and

55
00:04:54,788 --> 00:05:00,579
therefore, we have to consider the actions
of other players, essentially, and that has

56
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:03,568
to be
part of listening process that we do, essentially.

57
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,569
.

58
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:16,770
Now, I wonder if we have heard about this
game called Prisoner's Dilemma.

59
00:05:16,769 --> 00:05:24,269
So, let me
introduce this game to you in more familiar

60
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:25,689
setting.

61
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:46,319
Let us say, there are two players as
far as this game is concerned, and I am going

62
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,819
to write the pay offs here.

63
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:50,729
So, there are two
players.

64
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:54,709
Let us say, some hypothetical country, obviously,
not our country; there are two

65
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:03,159
students who have been caught cheating, and
the Dean has put them into separate rooms,

66
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:10,720
and they are being asked to confess, whether
they have helped each other, cheat or not.

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,640
The payoffs are like this.

68
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,439
Let us say, this is you, I mean, you meaning
not personally,

69
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,680
you, but the player for which, you are designing
this game.

70
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,209
Let us say, this is him
whatever, the other person, essentially.

71
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:35,448
You have two choices; you have to confess
or

72
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,620
.you have to deny, likewise, the other player
has two choices; you have to confess or you

73
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,439
have to deny.

74
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,180
When the game was originally defined, it was
defined in terms of two crooks, who were

75
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,379
locked up in two different rooms, and the
police were trying to interrogate them.

76
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,110
They
had to confess or deny, but the principal

77
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:58,129
is the same, essentially.

78
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,240
So, what is the payoff
here?

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,590
Let us say, these are your choices; confess
or deny.

80
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:17,689
So, if you confess and if the
other person confesses, let us say, you get

81
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:23,600
a E grade.

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,759
This is symmetric for both.

83
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:29,629
So, both
people will get E grades.

84
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:36,849
If both of you deny, then let us say, the
payoff is this; you both

85
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:43,569
get D grades, because nothing is proved and
something like that.

86
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,330
Now, if you confess,
and the opponent, if you want to call the

87
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:51,758
person, opponent; denies, and then let us
say,

88
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,990
you get a B grade, and the opponent gets an
F grade, likewise, if you deny, and the

89
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,720
opponent confesses, then you get an F, and
the opponent gets a B grade.

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,380
So, the top right
corner is your grade.

91
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:08,889
The bottom left corner is the other person’s
grade.

92
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,439
These are the
four possible situations; you confess, or

93
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:15,819
you denied, opponent confesses, or opponent
denied.

94
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:20,780
You can construct that game, three out of
this; two represent this choice.

95
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:24,718
Now,
remember that this is the game, which is played

96
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:30,490
where, you have to decide sitting alone
in the room, and you have been interrogated

97
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,490
by somebody.

98
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,509
You have to either, confess or
you have to deny.

99
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:35,279
You know the payoff matrix.

100
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,679
Both players know the payoff matrix.

101
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,569
What is the correct strategy to use here?

102
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,650
Game theory is concerned with questions like
this; that if you know the consequences of

103
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,529
your actions, in the context of other people’s
actions, what are the choices that you will

104
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:54,529
make.

105
00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:03,259
So, in this situation, you think it is good
to confess, or is it good to deny.

106
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:09,159
Rationally speaking, sorry, you have to speak
a bit

107
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:18,969
louder; deny is better; why is it?

108
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,389
See; let me explain this matrix, again.

109
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,539
The first, look at the first square here,
on the left

110
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,539
hand side.

111
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,149
It says that you are confessing, and the other
person is also confessing.

112
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,199
You do
not know what is the other person is doing,

113
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,950
but if the other person also confesses, then
you get an E, and other person gets an E.

114
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,960
This square says that if you deny, and the
other

115
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,730
person confesses, then you get an F; that
is your F, stands for fail, and the other

116
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:50,129
person
gets a B, essentially.

117
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:53,439
If you confess and he denies, then it is symmetrically,
opposite; you

118
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,600
get an B and gets an F.

119
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,580
If both of you deny, then you get a D each,
essentially what

120
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,660
should be your strategy?

121
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,000
..Confess.

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,580
How many people say confess, and how many
say, deny?

123
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,920
So, others, do not have an
opinion.

124
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,829
.If you confess, the other deny it should
be oppose it.

125
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,830
Sorry.

126
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,310
.If you confess and the other deny, it should
be oppose it.

127
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,799
If you confess and the
other deny, the other person should get a

128
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:34,370
B, because in this case, deny is paired in
both

129
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,850
the cases, irrespective of whatever he says.

130
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,850
Yes.

131
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,710
If you look at the other scenario, let us
say, two people have robbed a bank or something

132
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,710
like that.

133
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,970
I do not know which is the worst; the cheating
in a class, or robbing in a bank;

134
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,389
anyway, let us say, they have robbed the bank,
and then, the police is interrogating that

135
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:52,389
two people separately.

136
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:55,080
They say, if you confess, we will let you
off lightly, but the other

137
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,139
guy will get punishment.

138
00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,559
So, it is in that sense that you help them,
establish that there

139
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,599
was a crime, essentially.

140
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,690
So, it is in that sense.

141
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,330
That is why, if you confess and the other
person denies, you are let off with a B, but

142
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,590
other person gets an F, essentially.

143
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,290
Otherwise,
if you use deny, and the other person confesses,

144
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,199
it is the other way alone, essentially.

145
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,670
So,
many people said confess; why is confess,

146
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:26,669
good?

147
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:32,599
We should give a rational argument.

148
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,080
Game theory is about rational behavior that
what is logically, the correct thing to do,

149
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
essentially.

150
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,490
You want to maximize your grade in this case,
or in the case of those

151
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,629
robbers; they want to minimum their punishment,
but the problem are equivalent,

152
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:52,629
essentially.

153
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,100
.Irrespective of what the other guy does,
it is better for you to confess.

154
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,509
Yes, but either that, let us say, your answer
is correct, but I just do not want the answer;

155
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:01,509
I

156
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:02,509
.want an explanation.

157
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:11,700
.(( )), but if you confess, you will get a
B, and which is better than F.

158
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,960
If other
person is denying, you will get a better grade.

159
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,820
if other person is confessing also.

160
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,140
I will encourage you to draw a small tree
out of it.

161
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:35,649
So, for example, you confess, deny,
and then, the other person, confesses and

162
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:43,629
denies, or you can construct it like the other
person confesses and denies, and then, you

163
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,509
confess and deny.

164
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:52,689
You can construct the three
both ways and then, explore that, essentially.

165
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,380
.Either case, if you take the situation where,
whatever, regardless of what the

166
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:03,629
other person does, if you say corresponding
row; your choice is between confessing and

167
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,259
denying, because it is between E and F, and
in the other case, it is between B and D.

168
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:18,569
So,
it is always better to take the choice of

169
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,570
confessing.

170
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,570
Let us argue.

171
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,840
Let us just expand up on the argument and
say, let us say, if you confess

172
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
what will happen?

173
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,530
That means, you are looking at this row, essentially.

174
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:32,679
You are looking
at the first column.

175
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:39,199
If this person confesses, then you get an
E. If this person denies, then

176
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:50,650
you get a B, which is, this, so, looking at
this thing is, looking at these three structure;

177
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,009
first, you look at your decision and then,
you look at other two decisions and then,

178
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:55,009
and
see which one is better.

179
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:59,750
You will see that in this case, this is better.

180
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,350
In this case, this is
better and this is bad.

181
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:17,370
If you deny, if the other person confesses,
you get an F, and the

182
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:26,100
other person denies, you get a D. So, maybe,
this is actually, may be, let us look at the

183
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,379
other side of the argument.

184
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,000
If the other person confesses, what should
you do?

185
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,059
If the
other person confesses; so, you looking at

186
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,889
row, now; we are looking at this tree.

187
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:37,561
You can
argue this tree also, but let us look at this,

188
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:38,700
may be, this is simpler.

189
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,750
If the other person
confesses, you are looking at this row.

190
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,640
If you confess, you get an E. If you deny,
you will

191
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,939
get an F.

192
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:51,830
If the other person confesses, it is better
for you to confess, correct.

193
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,352
You are
looking only at the row.

194
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:59,079
If the other person denies, and if you confess,
you will get a B.

195
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
If you deny, you will get a D.

196
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,511
So, even in this case, it is better for you
to confess.

197
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,389
So, it is better for you to confess in
both cases, essentially.

198
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:09,679
If you look at, you constructed tree like
this where, you consider

199
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,789
.the other person’s choice as first, then
your choice, and then, you will see that your

200
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:16,029
choices; this is better, and this is better.

201
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,709
In this case, these two are better, and these
two

202
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,950
are the worst, essentially, but this way,
it is easy to evaluate.

203
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:29,640
Yes, the actual choice is to
confess, and assuming that the other person

204
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,090
is also rational; other person also confess.

205
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:38,730
So, your expected grade would be an E, essentially.

206
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:44,909
This E is called the Nash equilibrium
in this game, which means that if you divide

207
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:49,449
from this, rather the other person cannot
divide from it, without spoiling the game

208
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,450
from him, essentially.

209
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,759
Such an equilibrium is
called the Nash equilibrium, but is this the

210
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,549
best outcome?

211
00:15:55,549 --> 00:16:02,039
It is not the best outcome in
this particular matrix, because if both of

212
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,230
them are die hard people, I am not saying
that

213
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:11,009
students can be die hard criminals, but we
are talking about those robbers now.

214
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,909
If both of
them are die hard criminals, like you know,

215
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,490
for example, it is eulogolized in many films
essentially.

216
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,190
So, they are these two criminals, who were
really good guys, but you know, they will

217
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,230
never confess for anything.

218
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:26,680
Now, if you have two such people, and they
have trust in

219
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:30,679
each other in some sense; then, they will
both deny.

220
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:36,069
In this matrix, they will both end up
in this lower right hand corner, which is

221
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,080
the better situation than that situation.

222
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,900
So, this of
course, is called a Pareto Optimal, but it

223
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:45,019
is not a stable optimal with this problem
situation.

224
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:52,039
If I want to exchange these grades for these
two corners, this E, E and D, D;

225
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,169
then the Pareto Optimal coincide with the
Nash equilibrium, and then, it is really the

226
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,389
best
solution, essentially.

227
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,720
Why is it called the Nash equilibrium?

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,759
Because in some sense, if you confess, and
the opponent is forced to confess, if he does

229
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:16,029
not confess, he will go off, likewise, if
he confesses, then you are forced to confess,

230
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:17,029
essentially.

231
00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:21,129
Now, obviously, you cannot get into complicate
or you try to get into

232
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,910
complicated, kind of pleasing that I can figure
out that it is real.

233
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,240
So, this is the basic idea
of game theory, puts you in a situation like

234
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,240
this.

235
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:37,599
It is a basic mechanism for studying
economics, when people try to evaluate things

236
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,329
like, what should be the pricing
mechanism; you know, how much will you advertise

237
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:47,009
and things like that; people use
game theoretical concept to reason there,

238
00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:48,009
essentially.

239
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:52,640
So, rational choice, in the case of
multi agent scenario, essentially.

240
00:17:52,640 --> 00:18:00,290
So, you can think of Price Wars, for example,
as the

241
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:01,569
game between two players.

242
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:08,849
So, let us first characterize the games a
little bit.

243
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:11,039
The kind of
games that we are going to be interested in,

244
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,558
are much simpler in nature.

245
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,558
..

246
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:23,319
These are called Board games, and as the name
suggests, they are played on a board, like

247
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,859
chess, for example.

248
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:30,849
In particular, the games that will be interested
in, have this following

249
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:40,649
characteristic; they are two player games,
which means that there are only two players

250
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:48,110
in
this game, but there can be multi player games,

251
00:18:48,109 --> 00:19:05,099
may be, will give an example, Zero Sum.

252
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:18,659
So, we would be interested in games, which
satisfy these (( )); two player, zero sum,

253
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,580
alternate moves, deterministic games.

254
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:26,359
I might even say, discreet games, in the sense
that

255
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:29,990
you know things, like chess and so on, where,
you have to choose between the set of

256
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,349
discreet, set of choices, essentially.

257
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,240
So, two player basically, says that there
are two

258
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,529
players, but you can have multi player game,
essentially.

259
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:41,349
I was just talking about Price
Wars.

260
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:47,139
If you think of Price Wars as a two player
game, which means, let us say, Pepsi

261
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:52,800
and Coke are getting into a price war, about
to decreasing prices to get more market

262
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,799
share.

263
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,609
Then, you can think of it as a two player
game, and you can also think of it as a

264
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:05,759
negative sum game, which means that both the
players as going to lose out on the money

265
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,859
that they get, essentially.

266
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:17,179
So, a zero sum game is the game, in which,
the sum of the payoffs of different players

267
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
is
0.

268
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,970
So, chess for example, one person wins, and
the other person losses.

269
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,829
So, if 0 stands for
a draw, and minus 1 stands for a loss, and

270
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,789
plus 1 stands for a win, then the total sum
is

271
00:20:32,789 --> 00:20:33,789
.always 0, essentially.

272
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:34,789
One person’s gain is another person’s
loss.

273
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:42,440
So, these are the game
offers where, you have opponents, essentially,

274
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,220
but there can be games, when there is
negative sum.

275
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,720
So, for example, this game is a negative sum
game, essentially, assuming

276
00:20:50,720 --> 00:21:00,779
that E and D are negative things, which you
do not particularly, like.

277
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:04,720
The Price War game is a negative sum game,
because the revenue of both the companies

278
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,230
is going to suffer a loss, which is seen as
negative, essentially, but you can also have

279
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:11,700
positive sum games.

280
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,460
For example, cooperation between people, if
two people sit down

281
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,870
and study together for an exam, then both
of them gains from it, essentially.

282
00:21:20,869 --> 00:21:24,089
So, you can
have different degrees of games.

283
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:26,859
So, Price War, as I said, can be seen as a
two player

284
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:33,869
negative sum game, but if you include the
third person, which is the consumer, then

285
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:34,879
it
becomes the three player game.

286
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,559
Let us say, there is one figurative consumer
and then, it

287
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:43,930
becomes the zero sum game, because whatever
the company loses, the consumer gains,

288
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,420
in terms of price we are talking here, essentially.

289
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:56,670
I missed out one very important
characteristic; which is complete information.

290
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:04,500
In complete information games, each player
knows; what are the moves available to the

291
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,099
other players.

292
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:10,230
Essentially what are the choices available
to the other players, essentially.

293
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,339
So, obviously, the game that we have been
talking about, like chess and checkers and

294
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:22,289
Cross and Knots, or Go; all these game called
Othello in which, you are going to do an

295
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:23,289
assignment.

296
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:25,129
These are board games on which, you can see
the board.

297
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,800
Both sides can see
the board, and therefore, they are complete

298
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,269
information games, essentially, but there
are

299
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:33,650
many incomplete information games.

300
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,380
So, games, like car games, for example, games
like

301
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:46,040
Poker; are incomplete information game, but
there are also games, which are

302
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,460
deterministic versus nondeterministic.

303
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:55,740
For example, if you have to throw a dies in
a game, game like Backgammon or Ludo, or

304
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:01,890
something like that, and that is not a deterministic
game where, you cannot predict the

305
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,740
outcome of the move, essentially.

306
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:11,130
Backgammon, for example, is a two player,
0 sum,

307
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,110
alternate move, and stochastic, incomplete
information game.

308
00:23:16,109 --> 00:23:20,179
The moment the game
becomes stochastic, it becomes incomplete

309
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:27,460
information, because we do not know what
happens, when you roll a die or when the opponent

310
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,009
rolls a die, essentially.

311
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,260
Of course, in
the real world, many situations where, you

312
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,899
have to do rational decision making.

313
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
You are

314
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,960
.mostly operating in an incomplete information
world, essentially.

315
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,690
An extreme example is
two generals, who are fighting a war, essentially.

316
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:48,900
So, you do not really know what the
other’s army is doing; which side they were

317
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
moving.

318
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,860
Of course, we try to have spies on
the other side, and you try to have intelligence,

319
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:58,719
may be, you take satellite images and all
kinds of stuffs, but that is an effort to

320
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,630
move towards the complete information,
essentially.

321
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:09,340
But in practice, of course, you have to work
when the information is not complete,

322
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:10,339
essentially.

323
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:17,789
Alternate move games are essentially, the
simpler kind of games in which, I

324
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,720
make a move and then, you make a move, then,
I make a move and then, you make a

325
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,089
move, which are easier to model for us, essentially.

326
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:29,389
Now, the moment I talk of alternate
moves, you can see that we are moving away

327
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,170
from these kinds of games where, there is
only one decision to be made, and you make

328
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,170
one decision.

329
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,539
Here, typically, you have a
sequence of decisions; I make a decision,

330
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:45,940
then, you make a decision; then, I make a
decision, and things like that, essentially.

331
00:24:45,940 --> 00:25:09,000
So, such games can be represented by a game
tree.

332
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,220
A game tree is a layered tree.

333
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:26,210
So, let me draw one, and typically, because
we talking

334
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,900
about two person games, there are two kinds
of nodes; one for one player, and one, the

335
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,570
other kind for the other player.

336
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:34,569
.

337
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:35,569
.Typically, we draw them differently.

338
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:40,970
So, this is the route node, which the first
player has

339
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:49,779
to make a move, and let us say, this is one
move that this player makes, out of the many

340
00:25:49,779 --> 00:25:51,399
possible moves.

341
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,009
Then, the other player makes a move.

342
00:25:54,009 --> 00:25:58,619
Then, the first player makes a
move, again.

343
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:04,489
Then, the other player makes a move, and so
on.

344
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:13,039
So, this is the game, which
is a, it is the actual game played, says that

345
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,039
one player made this move, and second player
made this move, and the first player made

346
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:17,830
this move, and so on.

347
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,729
So, square is one player
and circle is another player, essentially.

348
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,910
Of course, there are many choices that they
all

349
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,910
have.

350
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:32,970
So, in practice it is a tree or something
like this.

351
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:42,519
So, such a tree is called a game
tree.

352
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:56,109
It is a layered tree where, each layer represents
the choice for one player.

353
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:07,889
This is
some tree, I have drawn randomly.

354
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:13,070
Traditionally, this player is called max,
and this

355
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:22,980
player is called min, and you can see that
the tree, basically, represents a sequence

356
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,349
of
choices for both players.

357
00:27:24,349 --> 00:27:26,740
We are assuming that max plays first.

358
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,509
So, max has chosen
within these three moves.

359
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:31,558
Then, depending on what max chooses, min has
to choose

360
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:33,680
within two moves, and so on, essentially.

361
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,970
Such a tree is called a game tree.

362
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:38,970
.

363
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,829
In a game tree, leaves are finished games.

364
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:52,189
So, leaves represent the end of that game,
and

365
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:59,610
it has got three kinds of labels.

366
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:13,949
So, a leaf may be labeled by one of these
three labels;

367
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:22,450
win, draw or loss; and this word is from max’s
perspective.

368
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,048
When you say win, it means
max has won the game, and if you say loss;

369
00:28:28,048 --> 00:28:31,779
that means, max has lost the game,

370
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:32,779
.essentially.

371
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:35,009
This is for max.

372
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:36,640
Anything that we do is for max, essentially.

373
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,970
So, labels are for
max and so on.

374
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:54,829
So, we can complex this to W, D and L, essentially.

375
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:55,829
.

376
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:56,829
Let us label this arbitrarily.

377
00:28:56,829 --> 00:28:57,829
Let us say this is L this is D.

378
00:28:57,829 --> 00:29:18,439
This is D and this is W. This is
L, W, D, D, L. Every leaf must be labeled.

379
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,361
Every leaf has a label.

380
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:26,810
So, basically, the game
tree represents all possible games that can

381
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:29,480
be played; given the rules of that game.

382
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,940
When
we draw the game tree, we do not talk about

383
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
rules.

384
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,940
We just say this, a game tree.

385
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,980
You can
imagine that if you want draw a game tree

386
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,370
for chess and white starts first; white has
a set

387
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:51,369
of moves that white can make, which is 8 plus
8, 16 pond moves plus 4 knight moves.

388
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:56,489
So, those of you, who know chess, at the top
level, white can make 20 moves,

389
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:57,490
essentially.

390
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,430
You could just draw the tree and say, forget
about the rules of the game,

391
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,430
essentially.

392
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:06,009
So, a game tree is basically, a representation
of the rules of the game.

393
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:09,940
Once we represent
the game in the form of a game tree with,

394
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,350
we can just reason with the game trees,
essentially.

395
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:31,329
Now, every game has an outcome, which will
be the outcome, if both players

396
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,509
are playing perfectly.

397
00:30:32,509 --> 00:30:35,390
We are always interested in rational choice,
remember.

398
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,150
We do not
want to play against an opponent, who can

399
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,600
make mistakes, and things like that.

400
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,429
We
assume the opponent is perfect, and our analysis

401
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,210
is based on that, essentially.

402
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,730
So, if both

403
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:52,910
.the players are perfect, then every game
and a game tree is a finite tree, because

404
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,250
it has all
these leaves, essentially; has on outcome,

405
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,569
which can be computed, essentially.

406
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:00,609
So, just
like, you can think this as a game tree with

407
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:05,159
only one node, essentially, and its outcome
will be determined by what choice you make,

408
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,160
essentially.

409
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,470
At the same time, this is
simultaneous; this is not alternative move,

410
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,470
essentially.

411
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,069
Both the players are making
moves simultaneously, whereas, the games you

412
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:21,269
talking about; first max makes a move;
then, min makes a move; then, max makes a

413
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:26,210
move, like chess, for example, and so on.

414
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:27,210
.

415
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,679
How do we listening?

416
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:41,110
The outcome is called the minimax value, is
equal to outcome of

417
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:44,329
perfect play, one more thing.

418
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:49,189
By perfect play, we mean that each player
is making the

419
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,169
correct choice, essentially.

420
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:57,310
Let me ask you, for example, you are familiar
with Knots and

421
00:31:57,309 --> 00:31:58,309
Crosses, right.

422
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:06,759
This game which children play, or Tic Tac
also, as it is called.

423
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:11,589
You put
one cross, somebody puts a knot and you put

424
00:32:11,589 --> 00:32:14,720
another cross, and so on and so forth, right;
you are familiar with this game.

425
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,160
So, let me ask you; what is the value of this
game?

426
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:24,210
What
is minimax value of this game?

427
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,548
It is wrong, right; which means that we everybody
knows

428
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:29,629
that if we played perfectly, then the game
is withdrawn.

429
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,350
So, how would you compute the
value, minimax value of the game?

430
00:32:34,349 --> 00:32:37,990
Is that we would have a backup rule, we should
back

431
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:43,599
up value from bottom to top, and the backup
rule will basically, look at the kind of node

432
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,990
that it is; I will not write the rule; I will
just state it here.

433
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,079
So, for min, it means that if you

434
00:32:50,079 --> 00:33:00,039
.can back up L, if another choice is L; then
back up L. If none other choice is L, then,

435
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,039
if
you have D; back up D. Otherwise, you back

436
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:09,609
up W. You have forced to back up W, in
some sense, because min; the desired outcome

437
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:17,339
for min is the leaf labeled L, because min
wants to win the game, which means that max

438
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:18,439
should lose the game.

439
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,160
Therefore, min is
trying to drive the game towards L. So, you

440
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,390
can see what is happening here.

441
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,860
The first
move is made by max.

442
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:27,689
So, let say max makes this move.

443
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:33,669
Then, it means, it up to min; so,
min will try to drive the game towards L.

444
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:36,770
For example, there are some Ls here, but if
min

445
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:40,389
drives the game here, unfortunately, I have
drawn both of them like this.

446
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,470
So, let us say,
this is L. If min drives the game here, you

447
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:48,150
can see, max can choose W, and end the game
there.

448
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,840
So, it is better for min to play this move.

449
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,099
If min plays this move, then max will not
choose that, of course, you know, and max

450
00:33:55,099 --> 00:33:59,139
will choose this, and at this stage, min can
win the game.

451
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,210
You can see that if min makes this move, then
min can win the game,

452
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,030
which means, max should not really, make this
move, essentially, because perfect win

453
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,570
will have been here, essentially.

454
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,970
So, this kind of analysis is simplified by
this back up

455
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:19,578
rule, which says that you back up from leaf
to the routes, and for min, you choose.

456
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,579
.

457
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:26,759
So, for min, the order of preference is this.

458
00:34:26,759 --> 00:34:32,278
For max, it is this.

459
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:38,028
It means, min will prefer L
to a D; if it can see L and D, it will take

460
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:44,548
L, whatever, it will always choose the right
most; max will choose the left most.

461
00:34:44,548 --> 00:34:49,298
So, as we will see, it helps to think of this
as a

462
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:56,190
.supply chain kind of a thing where, max is
supplying some values to min, and min will

463
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,190
choose.

464
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:02,269
Min’s choice is always, prefer the L and
then, D, and then, W. Likewise, min is

465
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:07,679
making offers to max, and max will choose,
and so on, and so forth.

466
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,978
Before I fill up the
tree, let me also say that we can represent

467
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:21,328
this by 1 or 0, or -1 as well; just a numerical
way of representing this outcome, which of

468
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:27,680
course, gives us a clue, as to why max is
called max, and min is called min; because

469
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,169
max is driving it towards 1, trying to
maximize the value of the game, and min is

470
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,809
trying to drive it towards 0, sorry, towards
minus 1, and trying to minimize the value

471
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,809
of game.

472
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:41,410
So, that is why the players are called
max and min.

473
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:45,159
In terms of numerical value, it is easier
to state the backup rules.

474
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:46,949
Max
chooses the maximum of the values, available

475
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,889
to it, and min chooses a minimum of the
values, available to it.

476
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:53,318
What do you mean by available to it?

477
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,650
That, at from the next layer,
what is being supplied to it, essentially.

478
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,528
So, let us fill up this tree.

479
00:35:58,528 --> 00:36:03,009
This is L; this is D; so,
min will choose L here.

480
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:04,009
.

481
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,759
This is D; this is W; min will choose a D
here.

482
00:36:07,759 --> 00:36:11,960
This is L; this is D; the max will choose
a

483
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
D here.

484
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,929
This is, both these are Ds; so, min does not
have a choice.

485
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:18,998
Here, it is L and so,
there is only one node.

486
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:24,250
This gets backed up; L. Max will choose W
here, and we analyze

487
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:29,608
this part of the tree, earlier, right; min
will choose L here; max does not have a choice;

488
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:37,190
so, max has to choose L here; min will choose
L here; here, max will choose W between

489
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:40,499
.W and L; min will choose D from this.

490
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:44,728
So, as a top level, you can see that max has
three

491
00:36:44,728 --> 00:36:45,728
choices.

492
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:49,259
One of them leads to a node, which will evaluate,
eventually, evaluate to a draw.

493
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:53,790
This move will eventually, lead to a loss,
and this move will eventually, lead to a draw.

494
00:36:53,789 --> 00:36:56,818
So, max can choose one of those other two
moves, essentially.

495
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,528
Rationally speaking, and
the minimax value of the game is therefore,

496
00:36:59,528 --> 00:37:00,528
D.

497
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:12,909
So, this is the game, which has a minimax
value of D, essentially.

498
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:22,960
In some sense, solving
a game amounts to trying to find the minimax

499
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
value of the game.

500
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,199
It is called minimax,
because at alternative layers, you are minimizing

501
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,358
and maximizing, essentially.

502
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,848
So, in
some sense, you are trying to distinct.

503
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:38,900
Another way to put it is that we are trying
to find a

504
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,809
strategy for max.

505
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:46,729
Obviously, at the first level, we have known
that max should make as

506
00:37:46,728 --> 00:37:52,768
this move or this move, but on what basis,
are you saying that; that basis can be formulas

507
00:37:52,768 --> 00:38:05,798
in the notion of the strategy, and a strategy;
we are talking about max at this movement,

508
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:18,300
but we can talk similarly, about min; is a
sub tree, which is constructed as follows,

509
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:29,568
that
one choice for max, and all choices for min.

510
00:38:29,568 --> 00:38:39,360
So, by strategy, we mean that max is
freezing max’s choices is and saying; this

511
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,509
is my strategy; this is how I am going to
play

512
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:42,989
this game, essentially.

513
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:48,929
It means that every plays in the game, max
says that this is the choice I will make.

514
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:51,778
So,
that is why, the strategy is the sub tree

515
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:55,579
that we construct by making one choice for
max,

516
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:56,729
and all choices for min.

517
00:38:56,728 --> 00:39:00,018
Why all choices for min, because it is max’s
strategy, and max

518
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,889
does not know what min will play, essentially.

519
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:07,509
So, max has to account for, or cater to all
of min choices.

520
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,530
So, the strategy must consider all of min's
choices.

521
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:17,780
So, we can draw a
strategy for max.

522
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,099
One strategy is, let us say this one.

523
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:27,680
Now, we have chosen this, but for
this, we must choose both; because all choices

524
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,679
for min.

525
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:39,318
Then, we can have this choice for max, and
let us say this choice for min.

526
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:44,960
So, this is, the
thick lines represent one strategy for max.

527
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:52,099
Of course, yes, max has occurs to many
different strategies, and you can say that

528
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:54,329
the task is to find the best strategy for
max,

529
00:39:54,329 --> 00:39:55,329
essentially.

530
00:39:55,329 --> 00:40:04,249
Let us draw another strategy for max, which
is on this left side of the tree.

531
00:40:04,248 --> 00:40:09,318
So, max could have chosen this move, and then,
of course, you have to choose both these

532
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,318
moves.

533
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,400
Then, max could have chosen, let us say this
move, which is the better move and

534
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,559
then, min would chosen.

535
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,539
So, that is how, we construct the strategy.

536
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:25,778
At max level, you

537
00:40:25,778 --> 00:40:29,710
.choose all, sorry, at max level, you choose
one choice for max.

538
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,579
At min level, you choose
all choices for max.

539
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,329
What the strategy gives you is the set of
leaves.

540
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:43,960
Every strategy 
has a

541
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,489
set of leaf nodes, which tell you about this.

542
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:51,050
This is what will happen, if max chooses this
strategy.

543
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:58,528
So, the question I want to ask you is, given
a strategy; how do we evaluate a

544
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,528
strategy?

545
00:40:59,528 --> 00:41:02,768
Let us work with this one; numerical representation.

546
00:41:02,768 --> 00:41:07,419
Let us say the leaves are labeled with 1,
0 and minus 1.

547
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:13,579
Given a strategy, S, and I talk
about the value of a strategy; how can I compute

548
00:41:13,579 --> 00:41:16,460
the value of a strategy?

549
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,929
.Worst possible one.

550
00:41:19,929 --> 00:41:25,548
Worst possible one and by that, you mean the
lowest value essentially.

551
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:33,519
So, if you look at this white strategy, in
this white strategy, the leaves have W, D,

552
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,768
D, L;
four nodes in the leaves.

553
00:41:37,768 --> 00:41:41,479
The worst of them is L or minus 1.

554
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,509
So, that is the value of this
strategy.

555
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:47,048
If max chooses this strategy, he will end
up losing the game.

556
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:49,409
If min is perfect,
because the choices that are left, are only

557
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,409
for min, essentially.

558
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:53,940
If min is a perfect player,
then if max chooses this strategy represented

559
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,200
by this tree, then max will end up losing
the

560
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:02,460
game, and the value of the strategy is the
lowest value of the leaf nodes, essentially.

561
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,429
If you look at this strategy, then you can
see that there are three leaf nodes here;

562
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:14,108
D, D,
and W. The worst of them is D, and therefore,

563
00:42:14,108 --> 00:42:23,088
the value of the strategy is D or 0, in this
case.

564
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:26,759
If you looking at minus 1, 0 and 1, value
of the strategy is 0.

565
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,859
Now, none of them is
a winning strategy.

566
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:35,228
A winning strategy would be a strategy, whose
value was 1,

567
00:42:35,228 --> 00:42:36,228
essentially.

568
00:42:36,228 --> 00:42:40,618
Ideally, of course, you want to find a winning
strategy for a player, or max,

569
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:45,729
in this case, because we are writing the program
for max, let say, and somebody else is

570
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:53,788
handling min, or if you cannot find a winning
strategy, then at least, you should blue one,

571
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:54,789
essentially.

572
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:57,960
So, I will leave you with this question here.

573
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:12,259
Can we think of this as an AND OR tree, and
can we use A0 star algorithm to find an

574
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:15,068
optimum strategy?

575
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:19,849
Because you can see that this like an OR choice,
and this is like an

576
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:20,950
AND choice.

577
00:43:20,949 --> 00:43:23,629
This is like an OR choice, and this is like
an AND choice.

578
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,220
So, can we think
of it as an AND OR tree, and can we use A0

579
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:27,219
algorithms?

580
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:29,078
So, I will stop here and in the

581
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,880
.next class, we will take it up from here,
essentially.

582
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:40,880
.
