1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,339
So, we have been looking at reasoning in proportional
logic. And today we want to look

2
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:43,969
at recent method known as the resolution method.
This is given by Alan Robinson in

3
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:50,929
nineteen sixty five. So, it is a fairly recent
method if you compare it with for example,

4
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:56,780
free gaze axiomatic system which is more than
2 years old. This is by recent and it is

5
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,018
motivated by the fact that you want to write
a computer program to generate proofs

6
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:08,519
which means you have to find proofs automatically.
Now, if you look at the high level

7
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:16,420
algorithm for finding proof it basically says
picks some rule of inference, pick some

8
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:22,500
applicable data and produce some new data
add it to the system. So, it is basically

9
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
a
search algorithm which is searching in this

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,740
phase of sentences which can be produce and
trying to produce the sentences that you are

11
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,819
interested in.

12
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:32,819
..

13
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,218
So, to motivate this resolution method let
us go back to the problem that we have started

14
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:48,889
with the example that we looking at which
said that P and R or something like that R

15
00:01:48,890 --> 00:02:08,930
replies Q. P and S implies T and not using
the same symbols, but anyway it is a same

16
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:29,700
problem 
and from this we have to show T. Now, if you

17
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:34,869
if you go back over the proof we
did for this and this was to be shown. So,

18
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:42,170
this is 1 2 3 4 then we derive it for example,
P

19
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:52,770
from this thing and there was a rule called
1 called simplification. So, we use 1 rule

20
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,199
for
inference called simplification. And then

21
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:03,439
we derived R by the same rule then from R
and

22
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:21,620
R and Q with a derived Q. So, 6 2 the second
rule of inherency use there and then from

23
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:28,050
R
and not R or S we derived S. So, this is from

24
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:43,410
6 and 4 and the rule called differential
syllogism. So, I just used ds there then from

25
00:03:43,409 --> 00:04:09,680
this we get from 5 and 8 we get P and S.
And then finally, we get T from 9 3 and so

26
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,599
this proof required us to use 3 rules of
inference simplification 4 rules of differential

27
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,779
syllogism and the addition. And then of
course, we have to choose which ruled to pick

28
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:26,489
and what to apply.
So, and so it look nice and simple when you

29
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:33,999
look at just these 4 sentences and the
conclusion that you want to draw. But in practice

30
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:39,340
the set of facts that available to a
reasoning system would be hundreds of may

31
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:45,239
be 1000s of facts and you may want to ask
whether certain formula is true or not. So,

32
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,340
it is it is not that only relevant things
are given

33
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:52,538
to you there may be many irrelevant other
formulas and there may be 100s of rule which

34
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:56,991
may be applicable. So, if you look at the
power safety search example like we are

35
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:05,949
looking at in planning. It generates a huge
launching factor and the number of possible

36
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:12,581
.things we can do is very large essentially.
We have not use any axioms here so by and

37
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,460
large we try to systems were axioms are not
needed. It essentially they just add put

38
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:26,329
enough rules of inference which will work,
but as a motivator for this method say some

39
00:05:26,329 --> 00:05:36,639
other example we have given a simple formula
S and you are asked to derive P or not T

40
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,490
we asked to derive.
So, you must distinguish between this in tactic

41
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,460
process of deriving formulas as suppose
to the semantic process of looking at the

42
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:50,649
truth value. And saying this formula is true
if

43
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:55,679
you look at P or not P you can obviously say
it is true it is and it is quite trivial,

44
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
but the
question is can you derive it in the system.

45
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,098
So, just say that it is not straight forward
to

46
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:07,728
the write P implies P system if not. So, in
fact, you cannot derive if you are given only

47
00:06:07,728 --> 00:06:11,829
S
and you have given all kinds of rule of inference

48
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:17,668
simplification and differential
syllogism. There are so many of them it is

49
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:25,370
not going to help you can never derive this
from this equation that Robinson’s method.

50
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:33,259
Resolution method is a complete method if
you use only 1 rule of inference and it does

51
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:39,288
not need any extra axiom system for that is
why so very attractive it makes the task of

52
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,418
programming. It is simpler to simpler you
take

53
00:06:41,418 --> 00:06:47,068
that rule all need to decide on which data
to apply here that is of true still not a

54
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,780
straight
forward problem.

55
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:50,779
.

56
00:06:50,779 --> 00:07:02,438
So, what is the resolution rule as it is called?
So, will look at the simple form there is

57
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:05,460
a
more general form which we will may or may

58
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:08,580
not look at it later if you are given P or
Q

59
00:07:08,581 --> 00:07:30,538
.and if you are given 
not P or S. We can derive Q or S this is the

60
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,978
resolution rule in the
simplest form it could be P and Q or R also

61
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:38,800
does not matter. It does not have to be just
2

62
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,639
thing, but in the simplest form it has just
2 proposition here 2 propositions here. So,

63
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,319
in
the language of resolution method we call

64
00:07:51,319 --> 00:08:02,210
each of these elements are literal and
resolution effect resolution method works

65
00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:18,628
formulas in what is known as clause form.
And we are concerned in proposition logic

66
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,789
clause form is the same as conjunctive normal
form. So, we have to first construct your

67
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:28,129
formulas in clause form or conjunctive normal
form which means that you cannot use things

68
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,230
like P imply Q. And so if you have a
situation like P implies Q you should convert

69
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,490
it into not P or Q essentially. So, I will
take

70
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:44,990
it for granted that you can convert any given
formula into clause form clause form or C

71
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,070
n
f is basically a formula of the kind C 1 and

72
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:57,660
C 2 and C k where C I is of the form d 1 or
d

73
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:06,750
2 or d r.
Let us say and each d I is either a proposition

74
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:17,169
or negation of proposition. So, it is a very
simple structures form at the outer most level

75
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:24,149
it is a conjunction of clauses. So, C 1 and
C 2 and C k each clause is a disjunction of

76
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:32,049
literals d 1 d 2 or d R each literal is either
a

77
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:38,159
proposition or it is negation. The negation
sign is some sense occurs in the inner most

78
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,458
package if you imagine brackets all over the
places essentially. So, for example, you

79
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:52,629
could start up by converting this problem
into clause form saying P is the clause Q

80
00:09:52,629 --> 00:10:02,149
is the
sorry R is the clause. Then not R or Q is

81
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:10,289
a clause then not P or not S or T is a clause
this

82
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:18,829
corresponds to that this is not R or S. So,
I converted this 4 sentences into clause form

83
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:24,060
here. So, each one of there is a clause and
I can think of it as a P and R and this thing

84
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:29,828
and
this thing and this thing have a larger formula.

85
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:40,620
Now, first of all we must ask ourselves is
this rule a sound rule or a valid rule of

86
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:52,269
inference and its validity is based on a validity
of

87
00:10:52,269 --> 00:11:27,269
this equivalence P or Q. Or so I can keep
writing this, this should be consistence 

88
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,019
we need
this larger equivalence to argue about what

89
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:34,708
we are doing. But in practice the only think
we need this and this implies this which means

90
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:51,529
P or Q and not P or S implies Q or S,
So, for the rule to be sound so this implication

91
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:53,328
is a total logic it is a rule of inference
that

92
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:59,549
we have if you this and if you see this. Then
you can produce this and remember that

93
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:05,799
unlike the rule that that we talked about
earlier these are not patterns in the sense

94
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,289
that you
cannot plug in any arbitrary formula here.

95
00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:11,370
This is the clause; this is the clause and
this is

96
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:16,909
the clause which means the consistence or
proposition or negation of propositions it

97
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:21,600
is
not a arbitrary formulas but it take any such

98
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,290
2 clauses. So, if you want to describe this

99
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:29,949
.rule if you get 1 clause C 1 another clause
C 2 and one of them has literal and one of

100
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,519
them has a negation of that literal. We can
produce a clause to add up all the literals

101
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,759
here
and remove the, what is cancelling each other

102
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:48,459
in some says. So, we are talked about
clause form also instead of writing it C 1

103
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:55,099
and C 2 we often write it as C 1 comma C 2
comma C k. So, we think as it is a set likewise

104
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:04,960
this 1 d 1 comma d 2 d R where the
comma is interpreted appropriately and in

105
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,680
this outer level and in this outer level and
or in

106
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:29,669
the inner level sorry the joined by the and…
So, the rule of inference required by this

107
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:31,909
implication be true, but we are going to be
in

108
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:40,000
trusted in this as you will see in this moment
why that is the case. So, this is called the

109
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:57,828
resolvent this is called resolvent I always
keep getting let us call this resolvent whenever

110
00:13:57,828 --> 00:14:07,309
you add that resolvent to the set of clauses.
Then 2 set of clauses are equal in other words

111
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:12,309
what we are saying is that we can keep adding
clauses to the set. So, the resolution

112
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:22,328
method works as follows that is start with
a set of initial clauses let us called them

113
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:36,419
C 1 C
2 C 3 C k. And then you replace or you add

114
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:42,149
1 more clause to this which is the first
resolvent which means you are saying that

115
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:46,509
this set of clause. I am using a comma here
and you should not confuse this comma’s

116
00:14:46,509 --> 00:15:04,528
equivalent to and here or you can write and
that is to be safe I added 1 more clause here

117
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:21,399
then I can add one more. So, what I am
saying is there I keep adding this resolvents

118
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:29,370
to my set of clauses and what I get is an
equivalent set of clause. This set is equivalent

119
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,970
logically equivalent to this, this set is
logically equivalent to this.

120
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,269
So, you must prove that this is indeed the
cases once you prove this it is easy to prove

121
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,828
this, because from the right hand side to
the left hand side. It is trivial from the

122
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:44,068
left hand
side to the right hand side is based on this

123
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,698
that you are adding this extra clause Q or
S.

124
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:57,870
And then you can basically show this is the
topology and I keep doing this till I get

125
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,220
a
clause which looks like till I get the formula

126
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:17,860
which looks like this 

127
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:33,539
this is called the empty
clause till I generate an empty clause. So,

128
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:39,439
what am I doing? I am starting with set of
clauses C 1 C 2 up to C k and I added with

129
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,420
a first resolvent R 1 then to this added R
2

130
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:47,429
then R 3 R 4 and so on till R l. And at some
point I was able to generate the empty clause

131
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:52,870
and I added the empty clause to this set and
that is actually the algorithm terminates.

132
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,060
So,
what is the algorithm? Algorithm says take

133
00:16:56,059 --> 00:17:03,039
any 2 clauses which are which can be
resolved which means one of them has a literal.

134
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,949
And other one has a negation of that
literal resolve them produce a new clause

135
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:11,880
and added to this set. And then pick any 2

136
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,250
.clauses apply the resolution rule keep applying
the resolution rule keep, adding clauses

137
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,631
till at some point you generate the empty
clause. How do you get the empty clause? If

138
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:31,990
you see clause like this P if you see clause
like not P you can see P or nothing not P

139
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,819
or
also nothing.

140
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:39,019
So, when you apply this same rule here there
is no Q and there is no S. So, all you left

141
00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:43,099
with this empty clause we sometime write with
a box sometime we write with this.

142
00:17:43,099 --> 00:18:01,289
Basically it is an empty clause empty clause
stands for false or it always false. So, I

143
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:09,168
have
jumped a little bit ahead from the national

144
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:15,740
deduction of style of proof in the national
deduction style of proof. We said that we

145
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,390
keep adding new formulas and we terminate
when we find the formula that we interested

146
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:29,788
in here I already jumped ahead. And said
that the resolution method keeps adding new

147
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:38,970
formulas and it terminates when you
generate the empty clause when you find 2

148
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,000
clauses like this. And so this box is also
used

149
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,259
to denote an empty clause this bottom also
can be used to denote an empty clause.

150
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:52,779
Basically an empty clause stands for something
which is false in the resolution method

151
00:18:52,779 --> 00:18:56,769
terminates with an empty clause. And we will
see a moment why or I will tell you in the

152
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:02,379
moment wise, but what the implication of this?
What is the implication of the fact that

153
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,890
you have added empty clause to your set of
clauses?

154
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,429
We have to go back and see what were we are
saying here, we are saying that this set of

155
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,038
clauses logically equivalent to this set of
clauses which is logically equivalent to this

156
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,650
set
of clauses and so on which is logically equivalent

157
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:28,300
to this clause. Now, what is the truth
value of this clause? It is false, because

158
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,940
it is something and something and something
and

159
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,000
something and something and false. So, this
whole formula is evaluated to false which

160
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:44,089
means this is false which means this is false
and this is false I could have use the

161
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:48,319
resolution method to say terminate for the
example. In that example we are doing

162
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:54,109
terminate when generate T essentially, but
we are not doing that we are saying that

163
00:19:54,109 --> 00:20:01,339
terminate when you generate in an empty clause
which means we are trying to show that

164
00:20:01,339 --> 00:20:18,709
this formulas are unsatisfiable. That is why
this method is called reputation method it

165
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,400
is
used to show that a formula is unsatisfiable.

166
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,120
A formula when I say this is the large
formula right this got many clauses inside

167
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,829
it and it used to show that the formula is
unsatisfiable.

168
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:46,939
And the reason why the resolution method is
implemented in this manner is, because it

169
00:20:46,940 --> 00:21:00,929
has been shown that the method is complete.
If you want to derive null clause it is not

170
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,880
.necessarily complete if you want to derive
any arbitrary clause which may be an tail

171
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,429
by
the system. So, remember completeness means

172
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:14,140
whatever can be derived basically
resolution method is complete for showing

173
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,630
that a formula is unsatisfiable. If you give
with an unsatisfiable formula it will there

174
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,480
will a derivation which will derive the null
clause from the set of unsatisfiable formula

175
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,160
is it going to help us. We are not interested
in

176
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:43,211
unsatisfiable formulas or are we could we
interested in unsatisfiable formula. So, let

177
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,409
us a
question I asked you earlier in the last class

178
00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:52,150
we have 3 kinds of formulas; one is valid
formulas which are always true on the all

179
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,950
valuations there are satisfiable formula which
are true under some valuations. So, for example,

180
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,360
P implies Q is true in under certain
valuations then there are unsatisfiable formulas

181
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:11,129
which have which are true for any
valuation which are false for all valuations.

182
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,960
And essentially what we are saying is that
if we have unsatisfiable formulas then you

183
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,470
can
test it using syntactic procedure of this

184
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,870
resolution method which means keep applying
the

185
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:29,099
resolution method and you will be able to
derive null clause. And so first of all you

186
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,148
have
to convince that deriving the null clause

187
00:22:31,148 --> 00:22:34,949
is indeed showing the unsatisfiable. Because
of

188
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:40,360
this equivalence this whole formula is equivalent
to the 1 before that which is equivalent

189
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,089
to this which is equivalent to this which
is equivalent to this which means the original

190
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:48,959
set
that started with is shown to be unsatisfiable.

191
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:56,319
And remember that everything is to be
expressed in clause form. So, if I could so

192
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,809
have that problem to solve if you look at
that

193
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:05,428
top 5 lines there I have 4 premises given
and 1 confusion to be drawn can I set of

194
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:18,538
produce an unsatisfiable formula from there.
So, the process is straight forward. So, let

195
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:30,019
us look at the clause form here. So, I have
C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 5. What am I trying to do?

196
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:39,048
If I look at my logical notation I am trying
to do this P 1 P 2 P 3.

197
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:40,048
..

198
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:44,450
So, I am saying given these 5 clauses all
those 4 statements which are equivalent to

199
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,421
5
clauses, because this is the end statement

200
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:49,990
it is broken down into 2 clauses. Because
the

201
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:56,599
clause form says that the clause is has only
the this junction side inside. So, P becomes

202
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:00,699
the separate clause R becomes the separate
clause this becomes R or Q this becomes not

203
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:09,590
P or S or T and this is anyway not R or S.
So, what am I really trying to do was this

204
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,529
that
can I derive T from this clauses. If you go

205
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:18,278
the back to the deductions you know it said
that if you can do that then you should be

206
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:48,359
able to derive C 1 and C 2 sorry. So, remember
that that is what a deduction said that you

207
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,879
could take actually you could do it 1 by 1.
But

208
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,929
eventually we will come to this formula and
I will leave that as a small exercise. Because

209
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:59,340
we are also shown somewhere in between if
we have P and Q and the whole thing

210
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:04,459
implies R then P implies Q implies R. So,
the 2 formulas are simple. So, eventually

211
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,960
we
can all the ans come together here. So, this

212
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,390
is the set of premises implies the conclusion
is what we are trying to show to be true.

213
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:18,750
So, what are trying to show? You are trying
to show that this formula this larger formula

214
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:29,970
is a topology what I have with me is a method
which can show that a given formula is

215
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:38,450
unsatisfiable can I brief this gap is not
it? So, that is why I ask this question there

216
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,659
are 3
kind of statements valid statement, satisfiable

217
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:47,070
statement and unsatisfiable statement. If
I

218
00:25:47,069 --> 00:25:53,480
take a negation of a formula what where does
this how to how do they get related to each

219
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,720
other if I take a negation of satisfiable
formula for example, if I take the negation

220
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,798
of valid
formula or take a negation of unsatisfiable

221
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,599
formula. So, there is a clear relation and
you

222
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,459
.need to think about little bit about this
between the valid formula and the unsatisfiable

223
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,250
formulas. A valid formula is true under all
valuations which means every row in the truth

224
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,200
table. It will end up with true, if take if
you take the negation of that formula then

225
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,528
every
lower ends of become false. So, I have this.

226
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:35,200
So, I am trying to show that this is true
which means you show that negation of this

227
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:52,870
C 1 and C 2 and C 3 and C 4 and C 5
implies T is unsatisfiable.

228
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:59,369
Instead of trying to show that that this is
the topology which means you can be derived

229
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:05,859
and assuming a sound and complete system.
Instead of trying to show that it is a

230
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:13,569
topology I can say that take it is negation
and that there is a unsatisfiable formula.

231
00:27:13,569 --> 00:27:19,689
So,
you must convenience yourself that this is

232
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:25,808
the sound step that if I take topology and
convert and convert its take it is negation

233
00:27:25,808 --> 00:27:31,388
it becomes unsatisfiable. So, I produce now
what I think is a unsatisfiable formula and

234
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:35,898
of course, to check whether it is unsatisfiable
instead of constructing a 2 table. I will

235
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:38,058
use the resolution method to check whether
that is

236
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:45,509
the case. Now, just serious of steps if I
go to take this not inside so I have to convert

237
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:50,280
this
into clause form. Remember that the resolution

238
00:27:50,280 --> 00:28:02,190
method applies only to clause form if I
take this not inside I will get 

239
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:15,788
not of not of C 1 C 5 or T. So, remember this
equivalence

240
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:20,470
which said that alpha implies beta is not
equivalent to not alpha or beta. So, this

241
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,829
whole
thing I am taking as alpha. So, I am taking

242
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:27,949
not of this alpha and or this T and then when
I

243
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:37,080
have push this not finally, inside what I
will get this C 1 and C 2 and C 3.

244
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:47,130
So, that is the logically equivalent formula
now I have the formula that I have been

245
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:53,528
interested in clause form. So, each of these
is a clause I we already said that. So, each

246
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:56,669
of
them is a clause. So, we end this, this is

247
00:28:56,669 --> 00:29:14,850
just a literal from not T is also clause essentially.
Now, we have a approach to using the resolution

248
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:20,308
method which is that you take the set of
clauses that are given to you which is the

249
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:25,099
optimizes. You take the conclusion and take
it

250
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:36,609
is negation not of T and add it as a clause
and the claim is that this set is unsatisfiable

251
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,038
is
it unsatisfiable we can try and show that

252
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:44,538
using the resolution method essentially. So,
the

253
00:29:44,538 --> 00:29:50,960
resolution proofs all usually shown as directed
graph directly recycle graph. So, the

254
00:29:50,960 --> 00:30:00,829
resolution they are called. So, let us try
and do the resolution method here. So, just

255
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,298
write
the clauses again now this is P this is 1

256
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:19,538
clause this is R this is not R or Q not P
or not S or

257
00:30:19,538 --> 00:30:38,509
T not R or S. These are the 5 given clauses
and the negation of this is P I have the 6

258
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:44,419
clauses. So, C 1 to C 5 when negation of the
goal and negation of the conclusion which

259
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:47,470
is the 6 clauses.

260
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:53,409
.So, before we proceed you should be able
to see this is a very proof contradiction

261
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:55,889
what
we are saying for the given these clauses

262
00:30:55,888 --> 00:31:01,619
assume that conclusion is not true. And then
show the whole set becomes unsatisfiable which

263
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:09,918
means of course, this is unsatisfiable.
The only reason why this could be unsatisfiable

264
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:17,730
if this last clause was not correct which
means C 1 C 2 C 3 C 4 C 5 are anyway given

265
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:22,909
to us you cannot assume them to be false.
The only reason why this formula becomes false

266
00:31:22,909 --> 00:31:28,140
is because of not of T is there so not of
T meaning is false. Therefore, not of T must

267
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,350
be false itself it means T must be true it
is

268
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:40,308
proved by contradiction. So, that with a small
task of finding a proof and what is the

269
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:48,418
proof is a derivation which ends in an empty
clause or a null clause. So, let us see we

270
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,570
can
take any 2 clauses and resolve them. So, for

271
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:58,288
example, a h m well in this there are not
too

272
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:03,129
many choices, but in general a larger problem
will after you many choices, but in this

273
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,309
case we do not have too many. So, let us take
this and this and you get negation of Q. So,

274
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:13,799
you must see that what I am doing is applying
the resolution step from this clause. I am

275
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,990
removing R from this clause I am removing
not of R.

276
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:30,970
So, from this clause I am removing R and from
this clause I am removing not of R. So,

277
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:45,850
what I am left with this Q then is that correct
this Q is not very useful for me I can take

278
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:56,490
this and this and I can get S. So, remember
this is a directed graph I can take any 2

279
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:08,711
clauses. So, this is just a set. So, I can
take now this and this I get not P or T see

280
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:11,000
I can
resolve this with this or I can resolve this

281
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:19,759
with this. But just for the sake of the argument
let say we will resolve this with this. So,

282
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,910
you can see that actually we have derived
T we

283
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,460
have actually derived T, but off course, as
we know from the national deduction method

284
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,259
that is quite possible to do that. But our
method does not stop here our method says

285
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:35,950
we
have must derive the null clause. So, you

286
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:49,919
can see from this and this we can derive the
null form. So, this graph represents the proof

287
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,700
that the given set of clauses is unsatisfiable
and the proof wholes, because of this equivalence

288
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:00,350
that we have seen that we are keep
adding new things. And in the end we added

289
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:04,918
the empty clause and in the empty clause
basically stands for false you can see that

290
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,880
the empty clause is saying T is true. And
at the

291
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,940
same time you are saying not T is true and
obviously that stands for false or

292
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,030
contradiction.
If we can derive an empty clause then we have

293
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:20,490
shown that this set of clauses
unsatisfiable which means this large formula

294
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:28,068
is unsatisfiable. And it can only be
unsatisfiable if not T false nothing else

295
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,019
can be false because say that are premises
given

296
00:34:30,019 --> 00:34:39,239
.to us if not T is false then T must be true.
So, let us quickly just look at this rule

297
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,819
what
does says it says P or it says in terms of

298
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:49,639
literals at least P and P implies Q. And you
can

299
00:34:49,639 --> 00:35:00,099
do Q now you can see that if I want to converted
into clause form. I have P and not P or

300
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:07,980
Q and I deriving Q because you know these
2 are equivalent essentially. So, we can see

301
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:20,010
that is just 1 example of the resolution rule
been applied or if you look at says P implies

302
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:32,980
Q and not Q implies not P. And you can see
this is again not P or Q and not Q and not

303
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,630
P.
So, again in this form when you replace P

304
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,849
implies Q with not P or Q you can see it is
a

305
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:45,328
same resolution rule being applied take a
literal from here Q take the negation from

306
00:35:45,329 --> 00:35:47,880
other
1 and cancel that and whatever remains is

307
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,119
that. So, all these rules as we can see are
special cases of the resolution rule that

308
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,559
we have stated here. If at the resolution
rule more

309
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:01,369
general than this as you saw in this example
we does not have to be only 2 literals it

310
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:03,420
can
be more than 2 literals.

311
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:11,710
So, we use not P or not S or T and consider
it with S. So, removed S from here and what

312
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,369
was left was not P or T is not it? So, that
is so the resolution method is a sound and

313
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:33,039
complete proof procedure for the case of proportional
logic is it to introduced in 1965.

314
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:39,279
And since an lot of theorem proving work is
based essentially on the resolution method

315
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,340
essentially it is most popular way of proving
theorems, but so far we have seen the

316
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,630
proportional logic. So, what is the language
of proportional logic? We have set of

317
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,351
propositions and they could be stand for anything.
And we do not know the only thing

318
00:36:53,351 --> 00:37:00,680
that is sort of this system is solving out
for us is the meaning of the connectives when

319
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:04,480
you have this connectives what do the sentences
mean? What do compound sentences

320
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,550
mean when they when are they true and then
we can set of know extend that truth value

321
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:23,869
of essentially if you go back to the example
we started with this the Socrates argument.

322
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:47,740
All men are mortal Socrates in a man; Socrates
is man this is beyond our reach to talk

323
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:56,529
about this argument is beyond the reach of
proposition logic. Because we cannot really

324
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:06,339
do anything with this sentences essentially,
because what you need here is to somehow

325
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:15,039
understand what you mean by all. And then
relation between being man and being mortal

326
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:21,199
and then to say the same relation between
being man and being mortal this is applied

327
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:23,619
to
Socrates, because Socrates happen to be a

328
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:29,519
man. Now, this is not possible in proportion
logic, because if you say this is P this is

329
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,818
Q then there is nothing we can be do. There
is no

330
00:38:31,818 --> 00:38:38,670
logical connective applied here essentially
we could say for example, m stands for man

331
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:45,039
and n something else R stands for mortal.
And you could say m implies R is, but you

332
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:46,039
can

333
00:38:46,039 --> 00:39:00,769
.see that motion of all is essentially. To
handle this we need to go to first order logic

334
00:39:00,769 --> 00:39:09,269
which is a more expressive language which
allows us to look inside sentences.

335
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:16,730
Remember in proportion logic a sentence is
atomic and the only thing you can say about

336
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:24,568
a sentence is that in our mind it stands for
something. And whether it is true or false,

337
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:27,539
but
in first order logic a sentence can be broken

338
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:35,130
down into its consequence. And you can
look at the relation between the different

339
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:41,970
constitutes what is the relation between of
being between being a man and being a mortal?

340
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:45,389
And then saying that this relation carries
a what to Socrates, because Socrates is a

341
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:48,078
man therefore, same relation was applied to
him

342
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,990
that also mortal that is possible in first
certain logic. First certain logic will introduce

343
00:39:54,989 --> 00:40:02,169
motion of individuals men Socrates and so
on. In proportion logic there is no individuals

344
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,300
there are only sentences, the sentences can
only be true or false whereas, the individuals

345
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:14,273
are things which can participate in relation
essentially. So, in the next class, when you

346
00:40:14,273 --> 00:40:24,309
meet on Wednesday we will look at of logic
and we will look at all these proof methods

347
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:52,159
in the context of first order logic plus some
extra rules. So, we will stop here.

348
00:40:52,159 --> 00:41:02,159
.
