1
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:21,890
So, let us continue with the study 
of FOL. In the class, we defined the language,

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,160
essentially
the syntax and symmetries. Now, let us look

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,849
at how you can do reasoning or inferences
with

4
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:40,679
possible logic, but before we do that let
us just recap that, a language is defined

5
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:52,640
by the sets of
RFC. So, let us say that r is 

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:02,530
a symbol called g and very small language,
F is a symbol a 2

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:18,069
symbols, let us say one is called s and one
is called c and c contains of one symbol,

8
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:24,379
let us s
say is called e. So, we said that we defined

9
00:01:24,379 --> 00:01:32,629
a mapping I to define the meaning of these
3 sets

10
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:38,030
these things essentially.
.

11
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:44,450
So, this mapping is called interpretation
mapping, but we also call an interpretation

12
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:55,549
that is use
the symbol I is defined as a domain and an

13
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:02,859
interpretation mapping. So, an interpretation
of a

14
00:02:02,858 --> 00:02:10,329
set of sentences or a language is in terms
of the domain about which, the language is

15
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,740
making
statements and a mapping which tells you what

16
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,990
does is predicate symbol mean, what does
each function symbol mean and what does each

17
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,850
constant symbol mean essentially.
So, whenever a sentences alpha is true under

18
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:31,050
an interpretation and we defined the symmetric
in the last class. We say that is interpretation

19
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,849
entails alpha. So, it is a notation that we
use and

20
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:43,000
.we talked about the motion of valid sentences.
So, a valid sentence is something which is

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,979
true
in all interpretations, which means you can

22
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,659
choose any domain and any mapping function
and

23
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:54,699
the sentence will be true. So, basically the
set of tautologies that we can talk about.

24
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:57,719
So, for
example, the system that we discussed earlier.

25
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:07,289
Satisfiable sentences are those which are
true under some interpretations and unsatisfiable

26
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,959
sentences are those which are never true.
So, an example of unsatisfiable sentences

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:23,760
would be
for example, x not equal to x. So, such a

28
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,000
atomic formula can never be true essentially.
I think

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,729
which we can also read as write as x which
is the same thing.

30
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:35,729
.

31
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:47,259
It is just a short form that we have used
to write in. So, given a set of sentences

32
00:03:47,259 --> 00:04:00,289
s we say that
a interpretation which means a domain an interpretation

33
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:23,529
is a model for s. If every s belongs to
s interpretation imply this sentence s. So,

34
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,439
if you write a set of formulas or sentences
in a

35
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:33,089
given language and then you get find the domain
and an interpretation which makes all those

36
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:39,779
sentences true. Then we say that we have found
a model for those set of sentences. Logics

37
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:43,250
are
always tried to say this is the logic system

38
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,839
and does it have a model essentially.
You means can you is it true in some domain

39
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,589
and some interpretation it is just to for
the sake

40
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:56,239
of complete lesson. We not really go into
too much detail there. So, let us look at

41
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,259
this small
example of a small language which is got one

42
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:05,949
relation symbol which, we have called g and
two function symbols we have called s and

43
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:14,779
c and one constant symbol, which we have called
e essentially. Now, we can have one interpretation

44
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:19,699
I 1, which does the following.

45
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:20,699
..

46
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:30,069
Let us say domain is equal to national numbers
and I can say my constant. So, this is the

47
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:54,870
mapping I maps to 0, the number 0. This maps
to successor plus 1, this let us say this

48
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,840
is of I i
t 2 and this is of ii t 1, this maps to plus

49
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,139
or multiplication it does not matter some
binary

50
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:18,529
operation on this. This map to greater than
let us say. Then I can write statements for

51
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:45,629
example, I can say 
successor of e greater than successor of successor

52
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:55,341
of e. I would use this as
the prefix and then said the arguments are,

53
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,040
but I used so this variations.
.

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,830
So, this is the predicate symbol and these
are 2 arguments, which are terms and the terms

55
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,829
are

56
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:10,509
.used constructed using the function symbols
and the constant symbols here. They are no

57
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:17,221
variables in my sentence, but I can add variables
1 of them could be. So, I could write for

58
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:29,769
all
x greater than x e. I am not talking about

59
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:31,740
the truth value of these sentences. I am not
claiming

60
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,050
that this sentences is true or this sentence
is true. Always saying is that we can interpret

61
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,259
what
does the sentence mean and the meaning is

62
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,579
given by a choosing a domain and choosing
an

63
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,620
interpretation mapping.
Then any sentence in my language here which

64
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,370
I have define the syntax, the sentence like
this

65
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,220
is essentially saying as we all know that
the successor of 0 is greater than the successor

66
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,130
of
successor of 0. Of course, it is not a clue

67
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:00,990
set will, but that is what it saying. So,
we can

68
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,240
understand the meaning of the sentence and
this is saying that every x is greater than

69
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,740
0, which
may or may not be true or which is not true,

70
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,620
but that that is not the point. The point
is not we

71
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,359
are not talking about the truth value here,
we are talking about the meaning of the semantics

72
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,480
of the syntax.
.

73
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:25,900
As the same time I can choose a different
interpretation which is let us say streams

74
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:36,448
over
alphabet a and b and then I can say that this

75
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:43,019
now this is i 2 maps to empty string, let
us say

76
00:08:43,019 --> 00:09:06,308
lambda. This maps to concatenation, this maps
to successor in lexicographic order and this

77
00:09:06,308 --> 00:09:10,838
let
us say maps to longer than.

78
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:21,019
So, the point I want to really emphasis here
is that a language is one thing and what it

79
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,528
means
or what is the semantics of those sentences

80
00:09:25,528 --> 00:09:27,389
in that language is totally another thing.
It is

81
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,990
.depended upon the interpretation. So, a same
expression like this which is defined in my

82
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,198
language would mean one thing if I am talking
about numbers. It would mean a different

83
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:40,618
thing if I am talking about strings, it could
mean a totally different thing if I am talking

84
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:43,160
about
people. For example, I could map these things

85
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:48,610
to some relation between people. So, that
is

86
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,829
one point which, I really want to emphasis
that and this is something which is very central

87
00:09:53,828 --> 00:10:00,349
to
in fact writing programs as well as the study

88
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,639
of logic.
.

89
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:19,850
So, we cannot stop emphasizing the fact that
everything that we do in logical reasoning

90
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,869
is
based on forms essentially. It is not ma based

91
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:27,589
on meaning essentially any proof procedure
that I have, if you remember it says I have

92
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:30,000
a rule set of rules of inference, I gave a
set of

93
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,600
premise sand I keep adding new formulas. It
is purely based on form it does not matter

94
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,610
what
we are talking about numbers or they are talking

95
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,308
about strings or they are talking about
something else.

96
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,308
..

97
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:53,730
So, the logical system is formal and the logic
is basically captures valid forms of reasoning.

98
00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:05,159
So, this we have talked about earlier as well,
so it is it says that when is an inference

99
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,000
or sound
inference, which we call as deduction essentially.

100
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,839
How do we define deduction? Logic is
basically concerned with making sound inferences

101
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,360
and we have seen as to when can a rule of
inference we sound. For example, it is based

102
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:25,360
on tautological implications or tautological
equivalences and so on. If you build logic

103
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,009
around sound rules you will get a sound logic
it,

104
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,870
but everything is formal essentially.
.

105
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:41,639
.So, what is the reasoning mechanism that
we can use in first set of logic. We already

106
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,959
have a
set of rules that we have spoken about. So,

107
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:50,618
for example, still applies it still says the
same

108
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:57,339
thing that if we have alpha, if we have alpha
implies beta, then you can derive beta. Thus,

109
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,529
same rule we can carry forward to first set
of logic because it is only talking about,

110
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:05,850
how to
interpret this implication sign essentially

111
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,860
even that we have essentially. It not really
worried

112
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:15,829
about things like variables and so on.
So, it does not matter what alpha beta is.

113
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:22,539
As long as they are sentences this rule applies
essentially, but we also need some new rules

114
00:12:22,539 --> 00:12:25,169
of inference to take care of the fact that
we have

115
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:44,368
talking about quantifiers. The most important
rule is call universal instantiation 

116
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:48,420
and what it
says is that if you have. So, I will write

117
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:52,889
it as top and bottom if you have a formula
of the kind

118
00:12:52,889 --> 00:13:03,619
for all x and anything else inside this, but
which contains an x essentially.

119
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:04,619
.

120
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:22,569
So, let us say an alpha with some x somewhere
essentially, it could have other terms also.

121
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,088
If
you have a formula of this kind, you can have

122
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:34,670
a formula of this kind alpha which the term
replaced by a where a belongs to a set of

123
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:50,318
constants. So, what we are saying is that
you can

124
00:13:50,318 --> 00:14:00,198
always instantiate a universally quantified
sentence to a sentence, which uses the constant

125
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:06,028
essentially. So, let us see an example of
this. So, if you go back to the argument that

126
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:10,548
we were
talking about.

127
00:14:10,548 --> 00:14:26,698
The argument was all men are mortal, Socratic
is the man 

128
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:35,588
and you want to show that Socratic
is mortal. We had made an observation that

129
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,339
we cannot do this in propagation logic and
we

130
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:44,269
.need something more expressive almost stronger
to talk about this essentially. Now, we have

131
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,850
the machinery for doing that. So, let us first
translate these sentences into first logic

132
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:52,089
and this
is an exercise which you must have done i

133
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:54,160
am sure at some point of time, but if you
not done

134
00:14:54,159 --> 00:15:02,110
you must practice a little bit, but you can
translate this into a language as follows.

135
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,110
.

136
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:23,749
For all x, man x implies mortal x where, man
and mortal predicates. Since unary predicates

137
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:30,819
they basically define a subset of the universal
discourse of the domain. What this statement

138
00:15:30,818 --> 00:15:36,169
is
saying that, if any x belongs to this or any

139
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:41,618
x satisfies the predicate man, it must satisfy
the

140
00:15:41,619 --> 00:16:01,999
predicate mortal x essentially. In other words
if x belongs to man interpretation, then x

141
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:07,769
belongs to predicate man. So, what is this
man interpretation?

142
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:14,459
Basically, it is a set in my domain subset
in my domain which defines unary relation

143
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,958
of man
essentially. So, when you say man x we say

144
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,529
that x belongs to the set of thing, which
is call

145
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:29,909
men. So, recall that unary relation is basically
a subset relation essentially of the of the

146
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:33,019
u
universe of discourse essentially. You can

147
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:38,159
see the same thing as saying that man is the
subset

148
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:53,919
of mortal i. So, this statement is essentially
saying that the set of men and here off course

149
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,928
we
mean set of human beings is the subset of

150
00:16:57,928 --> 00:17:03,769
the set of things which have mortal essentially.
That is just set in English language we say

151
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,130
that all men are mortal in FOL we will write
it like

152
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,370
this, but the semantics of that is that the
set which corresponds to the set man. The

153
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:16,288
mapping
of this is a unary relation this is a subset

154
00:17:16,288 --> 00:17:26,220
you see call man I and essentially we are
saying this.

155
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:44,579
This sentence we can map to man Socratic and
we want to show that mortal Socratic. Now,

156
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:53,269
.with this rule of universal in sensation
which we often abbreviate to UI. We can produce

157
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,918
the
formula which is very useful for us which

158
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,090
is that I can instantiate this formula by
substituting

159
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:10,709
x equal to this. So, off course I should have
clarify here the belongs to set constants.

160
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:28,460
So, that
is a 

161
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:35,480
inference step of UI and then off course this
is the inference step of mortals followings.

162
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
.

163
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,048
Now, having used universal instantiation I
have a formula which is very nice because

164
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:45,298
it is
saying alpha implies beta and then I have

165
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:52,460
alpha and I can use which is this essentially.
Again

166
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,370
to emphasis the fact that it has nothing do
with the factor it is man or it is mortal,

167
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,779
it could be
all students have bright or all leafs are

168
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:05,609
green or all birds are small anything.
Any such statement if you have, if you accept

169
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:10,509
the first statement, if you accept the second
statement, we must accept the third statement

170
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,619
that is all logic is telling us. It is form
of

171
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,689
reasoning this form of reasoning is valid
essentially. If this is true and this is true

172
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,620
this must
necessarily will be true that is a lotion

173
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:24,719
of ((Refer Time.). What motion of proof is?
This gives us a way of producing the sentence

174
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,150
syntactically without looking at the meanings
of things essentially.

175
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:43,519
As you can see if you want to talk about mechanizing
this process, then there is a little bit of

176
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:51,149
guess work involved there. What is this value
of that? I should substitute essentially.

177
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,408
Off
course we look at this whole picture and we

178
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:59,039
can see that a must be Socratic in that case
of

179
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:06,129
that x must be Socratic. Off course I will
have this useful thing, but never the less

180
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,210
if you are
doing the forward search can of a process

181
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,480
and you are saying I have all these universally

182
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,650
.formulas, how do I proof something which
means you have to keep.

183
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:25,200
So, remember that the basic mechanism is pick
a rule pick a piece of data for which the

184
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,460
rule
is applicable and apply the rule essentially.

185
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,470
So, this universally statement could be applied
to

186
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:40,319
100s of people. Every element in my database
I could say Socratic is mortal, Ram is mortal

187
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,388
whoever essentially, anybody you give me a
name and I will say he is mortal that is why

188
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:51,158
I
could prove that thing. So, this off course

189
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,250
should trigger this thoughts about forward
reasoning versus backward reasoning for you

190
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,339
and we will look at that little bit, if not
today

191
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:10,579
then we will tomorrow.
The same kind of strategy is come into play.

192
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:15,298
When you do forward reasoning you have a
choice of applying so many rules of inference

193
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,548
so much data that we have whereas, if you
are

194
00:21:17,548 --> 00:21:22,359
doing backward reasoning, then you know what
you want to show true, but the thing is that

195
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:27,250
we need a role of inference which allows us
to. We need to be able to use backward

196
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,390
reasoning here.
So, if you remember as you saw during planning,

197
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,190
backward reasoning, backward state space
search for planning and into some kind of

198
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,769
problems essentially. So, are they similar
problems

199
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:44,589
here, we will have to see. Now, for a sake
of completeness there another rule which is

200
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:52,750
called
generalization. What this rule says that,

201
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:58,089
if you have a formula of this fine alpha a,
you can

202
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:05,579
replace it by a formula of the kind there
exist x, x.

203
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:06,579
.

204
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:16,339
.So, if I have the statement in my database,
which says is Ramesh is bright, then I can

205
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:23,629
generalized to say that their exist someone
who is bright essentially. Why do we need

206
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,940
this
because sometimes the goal may be to show

207
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:31,460
that there exist something, something, something
essentially. So, an example which is given

208
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:41,889
in one of the text book is as follows. It
says that

209
00:22:41,888 --> 00:23:12,379
you are given the following facts on a b on
b c green a, not green c. So, this is what

210
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,720
is given
to you the set of premises, the set s of sentences

211
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:22,028
that a is on b, b is on c, a is green and
c is not

212
00:23:22,028 --> 00:23:23,159
green.
.

213
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:56,250
Your goal is to show in exist 
on x then exist on y that on x y. So, the

214
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,000
goal is we asking
whether this formula is true. So, this is

215
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,970
given to us, a is on b, b is on c and you
can off course

216
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,950
do any interpretation of the set of formulas.
The most natural interpretation which comes

217
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,269
to
main is the blocks follow interpretation and

218
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,259
where green stands for a color. So, let us
accept

219
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:22,440
that, but the thing is to show that this formula
is true, we are not going to rely on the meaning

220
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,890
of those sentences essentially.
You want to show that this formula which is

221
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,399
there exist x exist y such that on x y and
green x

222
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:44,239
and not green y these true. So, what does
this formula true or not true? First of all

223
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,319
what is the
intuition whether it is true or not true and

224
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,579
secondly, off course the question that we
will ask is

225
00:24:49,579 --> 00:24:57,808
can we prove it. Remember the motions of soundness
and completeness that does a logical

226
00:24:57,808 --> 00:25:02,759
system prove every true formula essentially.
So, first let us let me ask is this formula

227
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:07,610
true or not true. You people have done the
career

228
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:18,869
.course should not answer what is the intuition
says? So, let us look at the meaning it saying

229
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:24,750
that there is a block on another block and
the block above is green and the block below

230
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,450
is not
green. Given to us is three blocks the top

231
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,380
most block is green, the bottom most block
is not

232
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:44,190
green nothing is said about the block in between.
So, I will leave it as a small exercise for

233
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,460
you to work out, but this is the kind of thing
you may

234
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,649
want to prove which is while sometimes you
may need a rule which say something like that

235
00:25:50,648 --> 00:26:06,479
essentially. So, this is the process of forward
chaining we are looking at. So, forward

236
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:17,389
chaining says basically stringing together
a set of facts by moving from the left inside

237
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:20,658
of a
rule where, we are using more exponents. So,

238
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:25,610
the right end side given alpha, you are chaining
into beta then given beta there is beta implies

239
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:29,519
gamma then you chaining into gamma.
So, you moving in the forward direction essentially

240
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,329
what is given to you and what can be
derived. You move in the forward direction

241
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:38,579
and this what we have doing here essentially.
Even this formula we can derive this formula,

242
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:43,418
given this you can derive this. So, you have
moving in the forward direction. The first

243
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:45,490
thing you want to do is avoid this guess work.
You

244
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:53,940
do not want to use this rule of universal
because if you go to use it directly, then

245
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,528
you would
end up during lot of guess work as to what

246
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:00,839
should I instantiate the values of the variable
tool

247
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:03,750
essentially.
It is clear if you look at this formula is

248
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,470
that, you know here we are talking about x
here we are

249
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:15,038
talking about. So, it make sense to somehow
say that I am instantiate x to because while

250
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,170
looking at both this formulas. So, the difference
is the universal instantiation rule only looks

251
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,159
at this formula then says I must produce this
whereas, if you also look that is then you

252
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,389
would
know the you have to produce this essentially.

253
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:38,418
So, let us define a new role which combines
these 2 steps into 1 step, but to that let

254
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:43,200
us first
modify our representation little bit to make

255
00:27:43,200 --> 00:28:03,319
it simpler for us. To do that we define something
in what is called an implicit quantifier form.

256
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:14,928
So, we want to express our formulas without
actually lighting down the quantifies because

257
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:19,129
remember that if you going to write programs
to process these sentences, then you have

258
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:23,759
to in worry about how to interpret the quantifies
and so on. So, you will have to parse them

259
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,620
in you know construct quantifies and then
take

260
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:28,908
them as a stuff.

261
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:29,909
..

262
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:37,730
So, instead what is normally done is to express
the quantifies implicitly and for today’s

263
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,878
class
we will only look at the universal quantify

264
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,839
because that is all we have here. We are not
worry

265
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:52,308
about the existential quantify in the next
class for a universal quantifier. So, if x

266
00:28:52,308 --> 00:28:58,480
is universally
quantified.

267
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
.

268
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:12,069
So, for the moment let us assume that we know
the nature of a variable. So, in our logic

269
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:15,210
that
we have defined there only 2 kinds of quantifiers

270
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,340
and in the sentences there are no free
variables. So, start with there are only bound

271
00:29:19,339 --> 00:29:22,109
variables and variables are bound either by
a

272
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:27,788
.universal quantifier or by a existential
quantifier. So, let us assume that we know

273
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:32,339
the nature
of the quantifier and we can somehow say that

274
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,439
is a universally quantified variable, which
is

275
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,950
easy in sentences like this, but in more complex
sentences we will see later it is not.

276
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:48,620
So, let us assume that we can do that than
in the implicit quantifier form, we simply

277
00:29:48,619 --> 00:30:00,439
place it
with x souse the same symbol x. So, this is

278
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:08,730
just a convention which says that I am going
to

279
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,329
use the question mark to stands for a variable,
which is universally quantified, which means

280
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,558
I
will now rewrite this whole thing as follows

281
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:24,859
that man x implies mortal x.
.

282
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:34,138
So, instead of writing is like that I am writing
like this, but it does not mean that i have

283
00:30:34,138 --> 00:30:41,428
changed the sentence, the sentence is still
the same except that the universal quantifiers

284
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:48,169
implicit. I have indicated it in my sentence
by putting a question mark before the variable,

285
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:56,960
which tells we that this variable all these
occurrences of this variable has one occurrence

286
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,569
of a
universal quantifier before the sentence is

287
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,259
implicit. It is their like in that, but it
is implicit

288
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:05,269
essentially.
You can see that this is basically motivated

289
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:07,579
to simplify the processing that you do when
you

290
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:24,999
write a program to do forward chaining essentially.
So, given this and given this 

291
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,889
you can see
that it is becoming a little bit simpler to

292
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:33,648
do this processing. Somehow if I could have
a

293
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:40,028
version of more exponents, which did not require
an exact match, but which allowed us to

294
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:44,159
substitute anything for a universally quantified
variable, then life would become simpler.

295
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,710
I
would say I am trying to match this with this,

296
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:47,899
how can I do this?

297
00:31:47,898 --> 00:31:48,898
..

298
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:53,308
If you can simply say x equal to you can do
it and then this will become like the step

299
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:56,369
of
universal instantiation. Again I would like

300
00:31:56,369 --> 00:31:59,189
to emphasis, I am not doing it independently
first I

301
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,639
am now looking at a modified version, which
will have this built into it essentially.

302
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:07,839
So, in
some sense I know the target to which I want

303
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:11,639
to instantiate because I have this fact here
essentially.

304
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:28,169
So, this rule is call in that calling modified
and the rule is as follows. It says that let

305
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:47,139
us say m,
m p and it says that from alpha prime 

306
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:59,148
and alpha implies beta, beta prime where,
a 

307
00:32:59,148 --> 00:33:19,329
substitution
let us say theta applied to alpha gives alpha

308
00:33:19,329 --> 00:33:32,308
prime. So, we are saying the substitution
is a

309
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:46,759
function which when you applied to any formula,
then it replaces some occurrences of

310
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:53,899
variables in that formula with other occurrences
essentially. So in fact, when applied alpha

311
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:59,829
implies beta, it gives you alpha prime implies
beta prime or it gives you alpha implies beta

312
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:05,249
whole prime.
What is the substitution? A substitution is

313
00:34:05,249 --> 00:34:14,500
basically a set of variable value pairs and
in our

314
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:30,141
case, the variable is x and the value that
is Socratic that is the substitution we are

315
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:38,670
interested
in. What does it do? It says that when I apply

316
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:44,130
theta to alpha implies beta I am looking at
this

317
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:49,550
specific example. In general if you apply
theta to any formula this is just one kind

318
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:53,150
of a
formula which we have interested in. It gives

319
00:34:53,150 --> 00:35:03,599
you alpha prime implies beta prime and how
does it give you that it substitutes.

320
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,130
So, what is the substitution telling we it
saying that you substitute every occurrence

321
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,369
of x with

322
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:17,779
.Socratic essentially. So, if I apply the
substitution to this if this is my alpha implies

323
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:21,990
beta, then
my alpha prime implies beta prime is this.

324
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:32,439
So, this is alpha implies beta and this becomes
alpha prime implies beta prime under the substitution

325
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,559
theta is equal to x.
.

326
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:48,650
So, how we are saying is that the substitution
tells you what to substitute for the set of

327
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,369
variables named in the substitution. In this
substitution only one variable is named which

328
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,190
is x
and a very simple substitution is given which

329
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,619
is, but it could be anything else. I could
substitute any for example, arbitrary term

330
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,400
for it I could say the grandfather of which
means

331
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:26,670
let us say the father of mother of Socratic.
That is a term remember 

332
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,661
that is also a term I could
have substituted this in my formula, then

333
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:35,490
I would have formula which says if grandfather
is

334
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:41,079
the man, then grandfather is mortal.
I would have got that statement instead the

335
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,909
substitution that I am doing here is which
for x.

336
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:50,369
So, I am getting this statement that if is
a man then is mortal that is alpha prime implies

337
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,659
beta
prime. I already have alpha prime here which

338
00:36:53,659 --> 00:37:00,911
has got inside. So, now I can apply more
directly essentially. So, this whole 2 step

339
00:37:00,911 --> 00:37:04,269
process is collapse into one step process
in this

340
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:09,519
modified exponents rules where, thus instantiation
is taking place somewhere inside by

341
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:14,849
means of a substitution.
It is saying that if you given a formula alpha

342
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,469
prime and a formula alpha implies beta, if
you

343
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:24,279
can somehow found find the substitution which
will make these two equal. So, the technical

344
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:30,190
term you uses the unifier, which we will study
in the next class, but for the moment just

345
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,190
let us

346
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:35,730
.think of it does a substitution, which will
make this formula equal to this formula which

347
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,909
is
what the universal instantiation step is doing.

348
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:49,769
So, the technical way of saying that is if
you can unify alpha prime with alpha and you

349
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:53,179
can
always unify by means of a substitution, which

350
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:59,929
means you make them look the same. Then
you can imply beta prime directly, which means

351
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:03,629
apply the same substitution to beta. What
is

352
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:15,619
beta here, mortal x man x implies mortal x.
So, this is alpha and this is beta and this

353
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:22,099
is alpha
prime. I can make alpha prime and alpha the

354
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,750
same by saying applying the substitution x
equal

355
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:32,179
to this. This rule says apply the same substitution
to the right hand side of the expression and

356
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:36,469
directly infra mortal.
.

357
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:49,469
So, this step is, this is the modified rule
that says that I can substitute directly here

358
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,250
jump to
this conclusion in some sense without having

359
00:38:52,250 --> 00:39:04,659
into go through that step of instantiation
explicitly, but this is a simple example.

360
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:09,250
It has unary predicate with only one argument
and so

361
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:17,789
it is easy to understand. In general modifies
says that given any alpha prime and anything

362
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:18,809
of
alpha implies beta.

363
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:23,969
In fact, I do not need have to call it alpha
I could call it gamma. I can unify gamma with

364
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:30,529
alpha, but it traditionally we see alpha prime
in alpha. If you can somehow make them the

365
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:35,720
same, then go higher and make the inference
and apply the same way of making them the

366
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:45,429
same to the conclusion as well essentially.
So, apply the same substitution to beta to

367
00:39:45,429 --> 00:39:49,199
get beta
prime.

368
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:56,239
.So, if I have a simple database and by simple
I mean, I have only statements of this kind

369
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:01,429
something x implies something x. So, b b x
implies 2 x which one let us say there is

370
00:40:01,429 --> 00:40:03,639
only 1
variable could have more than 1 variable essentially.

371
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:16,589
So, you could have a statement which
says friend x y implies friend y x essentially,

372
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:22,820
then I could say Suresh is the friend of Ramesh.
I could infer that Ramesh is the friend of

373
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,640
Suresh essentially by applying this rule.
So, if I have

374
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:33,019
a simple database of the kind where, I can
apply modest exponents rule then I have a

375
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:37,699
simple
mechanism for keep applying rule repeatedly

376
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:47,909
till i generated formula that 
I have essentially.

377
00:40:47,909 --> 00:40:52,279
Let us assume we are using only modified modest
exponents because our data is of that

378
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:00,300
nature, but still the question of which facts
to apply to is still open. You still do not

379
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,740
know
there is no sense of direction saying that

380
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:05,079
this is an inference I should make. So, the
same

381
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,860
problem of huge branching factor in the forward
direction exist in forward chaining

382
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:27,010
essentially. So, can we do backward chaining.
So, what would backward chaining be like.

383
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:31,700
So,
let me just give you a hint here and we will

384
00:41:31,699 --> 00:41:38,859
take it up the next class.
So, backward chaining needs to distinguish

385
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:47,090
between statements which are there in the
database. Let us call them facts and statements

386
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,890
which you want to show to be true essentially.
So, forward chaining is simple you have a

387
00:41:51,889 --> 00:41:54,949
set of facts given to you which includes no
rules

388
00:41:54,949 --> 00:42:00,119
and statements like all these kind of statements.
You can keep adding new statements and you

389
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:08,980
can terminate when the required statement
is produced essentially.

390
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:16,139
If I want to do backward chaining what is
the mechanism that I have been used to do

391
00:42:16,139 --> 00:42:21,379
backward chaining. So, let me take the same
rules, but I want to express something like

392
00:42:21,380 --> 00:43:06,470
this.
To show what I am trying to highlight here

393
00:43:06,469 --> 00:43:08,619
is that you need to distinguish between what
you

394
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,380
have and what you do not have.

395
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,380
..

396
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,630
What you have is the set of facts, what you
do not have is something you want to show

397
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,150
to be
true. So, we could use a marker this is only

398
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,950
for programming purposes. It is not part of
the

399
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:28,179
language. It says that if you have a goal
beta prime and if you have a rule of the kind

400
00:43:28,179 --> 00:43:30,559
alpha
implies beta. So, we call this a rule left

401
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,829
hand side, right hand side, then you can replace
the

402
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:42,400
goal of showing beta prime with the goal of
showing alpha prime essentially.

403
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,369
If you implementing this we will need to keep
the facts that we have in one set of formulas,

404
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:53,109
which are separated from the goals that we
are trying to show. So, we can do that simply

405
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,230
here
on the board by putting a marker called show.

406
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,260
So, when you have marker called show it
means, it is a goal it is not something which

407
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,340
is true. It is something you want to show
to be

408
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:07,200
true and this is saying that to show that
beta prime is true, if you have a rule of

409
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,909
a kind alpha
implies beta and you can do this unification

410
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:12,259
process.
So, you can find the substitution then you

411
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,510
can reduce it to a sub goal of saying show
that

412
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:18,900
alpha prime is true or does a translate to
our problem here. It says that if you want

413
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,160
to show
that Socratic is mortal and if you have a

414
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:28,039
rule which says all men are mortal, then substitute
or

415
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,409
replace the goal of showing that Socratic
is mortal with the goal of showing that Socratic

416
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:35,379
is a
man. This is the process of backward chaining.

417
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:43,720
So, from goals you are moving to sub goals
essentially. Now, you can see that this process

418
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,980
is
going to become a little bit complicated.

419
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:49,670
If my left inside had more than one statements.
So

420
00:44:49,670 --> 00:45:01,409
for example, you can define a grandfather
by saying that x is a grandfather of y, if

421
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:02,409
x is a

422
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:08,960
.father of z and z is the parent of y, you
could define it like this. Now to show that

423
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,579
x is a
grandfather of y, you would have to show both

424
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,179
those things that show that there exist a
z

425
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:23,440
whose father is x and there exist I mean that
same z is a father of y essentially.

426
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:43,960
So, grandfather x y if father x z and p stands
for parent z y. In the forward direction I

427
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,590
would
have this fact somewhere that says Peter is

428
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:54,829
the father of marry and marry is a mother
of John,

429
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:59,730
then I can show that Peter is a grandfather
of john by going in a forward direction. In

430
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:09,250
a
backward direction I have to put and here.

431
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,579
So, you can reduce the sub goal to these 2
sub

432
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:20,610
goals, but there is and here essentially.
May be there is another rule which says that

433
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:26,000
grandfather of x y. So, let me say instead
of

434
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:39,519
parent I have mother here father x z father
z y I have 2 separate rules. This rule says

435
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,880
that x is
a father of father of y, this rule says that

436
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,780
x is a father of mother of y essentially.
For some

437
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,900
reasons I have these 2 separate rule, then
you can see that to show that Peter is a grandfather

438
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,910
of John I could either use this rule or I
could use this rule. So, you can see that

439
00:46:57,909 --> 00:47:00,819
it is becoming
an AND-OR tree essentially.

440
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:05,400
You could either use one rule or you could
use another rule essentially. So, backward

441
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:16,210
chaining has this complication. You know that
how do you get that to think like this. So,

442
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,349
essentially it maps to AND-OR tree and we
will look at that in the next class essentially.

443
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:25,829
Essentially, what backward chaining is saying
is that from a goal you can move to a sub

444
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:26,829
goal
essentially.

445
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:36,099
So, I will stop here and in the next class
we will look at this process of finding the

446
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:40,779
substitution here and there is a very nice
algorithm call unification algorithm which

447
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,320
some of
you must have studied for doing so. We will

448
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:57,080
see how this kind of AND-OR trees is a tackled.
We will also briefly mention as to this kind

449
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:02,400
of backward chaining process is what really
this

450
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:10,539
language prolonged does. Just to complete
the course may be we will look at the resolution

451
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:17,779
method in first set of logic and the motivation
for that method can be this problem that we

452
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
have here.

453
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,780
..

454
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:28,540
So, let me reveal to you that this sentence
is indeed true, but it cannot be proven either

455
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,530
by a
forward chaining or backward chaining. Those

456
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:35,940
methods are not complete, but resolution
method we showed this or at least we talked

457
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,010
about it. In proportional logic case also
it is a

458
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,660
complete method essentially which is why it
is so attractive essentially. So, we will

459
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,059
end the
course with resolution method for first set

460
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:55,679
of logic, which is in the next two classes
I think.

461
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:05,679
.
