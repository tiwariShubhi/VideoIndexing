OLIVIER DE WECK: So
let's get to work.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,730
The V-Model, well,
believe it or not,

12
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,429
but we've arrived today
at the bottom of it,

13
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:37,659
the pointy part of the V. We're
arriving at the bottom of it,

14
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,259
and the bottom of
it is basically you

15
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:45,879
driving down the design in all
its glory and all its details.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,219
And we call this
design definition,

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,089
and then I want to talk about
multidisciplinary optimization,

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,780
including what happens at
the CDR, the critical design

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,370
review.

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,091
Yeah, go ahead.

21
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,049
AUDIENCE: All right, I
do have a quick question

22
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:00,909
about A4 based to this.

23
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:04,628
Do you want a CAD drawing
or a hand drawing?

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,790
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'm fine with
a nice dimension hand drawing,

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,270
but we're gonna talk
about CAD next week.

26
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:17,429
So I do think it would be
good to have a CAD drawing,

27
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,950
but you know CAD drawings can
come in very different levels

28
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,420
of detail, right?

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,480
So I think it would be
good to have an idea,

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,100
if the PDR package--

31
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:28,959
most of the PDR
packages that you

32
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:32,229
see that have been submitted
in prior years at CanSat,

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,060
they do have a CAD
drawing in there

34
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,037
for their sort of
suggested configuration.

35
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:38,620
And you know, it is
useful because you

36
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,380
get to see whether the
packaging concept really works.

37
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:44,199
You know, the sketching,
you can get away

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,700
with a lot just sketching.

39
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,060
So my answer would
tend to be yes,

40
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,670
but if absolutely,
you don't feel

41
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,739
like you need it or you
don't want to do it,

42
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,649
then a nice hand drawing with
dimensions will do as well.

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,900
OK, so let's talk about
the bottom of the V.

44
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,609
The other thing I'm
gonna cover today

45
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,250
is this idea of
multidisciplinary design

46
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,909
optimization, and so
where does that fit in?

47
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,000
So you remember we talked about
concept synthesis, concept

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,520
generation, screening,
and selection,

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,430
and then at the PDR
stage, you know,

50
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,590
we picked one architecture.

51
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,509
So today's topic
is really how do

52
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:29,019
you get this architecture,
which is shown as this square

53
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,360
here to an optimal?

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,060
And I put optimal in
quotes here because we're

55
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,439
gonna argue what that means, but
you've refined the design, such

56
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,509
that you can go
present it at the CDR.

57
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,079
So you take this box here,
which is your concept,

58
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,340
and you open the box--

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,900
you can see this on the right--

60
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,360
and you really dive
into the details

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,880
of the various
subsystems and components

62
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,439
and how they're connected.

63
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,199
And what you're trying to
do is fine tune your design.

64
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:58,969
So this is shown
here schematically.

65
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:01,840
Let's say there's a
design variable X1

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,090
and you want to find where
is the optimal point?

67
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,090
This point here seems to
be optimal to minimize

68
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,390
metric three and
that's the design

69
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,979
that you're gonna propose.

70
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:16,119
So today's topic really is
about fine tuning the design

71
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,050
and coming up with a
CDR level design, that's

72
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,790
what we want to talk about.

73
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:25,039
And so what I'll cover
is different topics.

74
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,579
So first of all, the
NASA view of this.

75
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,280
It's called the design
definition process.

76
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,189
Then I'll talk about MDO,
multidisciplinary design

77
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:36,729
optimization, the use
of so-called CDFs,

78
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:39,280
concurrent design
facilities, and then

79
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,219
finally, what happens at CDR.

80
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:47,120
So the general idea of the
design solution definition

81
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,490
process is that you
start with something

82
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,360
like this on the left.

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,310
This is a product breakdown
structure, essentially

84
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,849
your system architecture,
your system decomposition.

85
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,599
And on the right side,
you then translate this

86
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,789
to a detailed design, OK?

87
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,923
So for a launch
vehicle, we have,

88
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:10,340
you know, the flight segment,
this is what-- actually it's

89
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,819
gonna fly and it has a payload
element, the spacecraft

90
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:16,980
bus, and then the launch and
the launch accommodation.

91
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,470
So that's the general idea is
you have high-level breakdown,

92
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,630
but then you need to
design every piece.

93
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:26,719
You need to have
chosen your materials.

94
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,180
You need to have
chosen the dimensions.

95
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,579
You need to understand
the interfaces.

96
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,490
And for every part, you
also need to decide what?

97
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,790
What's a big decision
that you need

98
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,460
to make when you go to
the detailed design,

99
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,849
beside, you know, material,
dimensions, software?

100
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,580
What is always a
big decision to make

101
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,000
when you do a detailed design?

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,860


103
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,367
Go ahead.

104
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,325
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
interfaces between the two.

105
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,115
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yep,
interfaces, all that.

106
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:03,409
What I'm trying
to get at is COTS.

107
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,439
Who knows this acronym, COTS?

108
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,139
Let's see if the, EPFL,
anybody know COTS?

109
00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:09,889
What does it mean?

110
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:17,029


111
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:19,741
I think we can't
hear you right now.

112
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:21,200
AUDIENCE: Commercial
off the shelf.

113
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,329
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Commercial off the shelf.

114
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:27,199
So you have to decide
in the detailed design

115
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,029
are you going to pick
components from a catalog,

116
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:36,289
or are you going to custom
design these components, right?

117
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,350
And so one of the
things at the CDR, that

118
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,150
I always ask the question--

119
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,310
so you present your CDR design.

120
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,509
What percentage, what fraction
of your parts at the lowest

121
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:54,680
level are COTS and what
fraction did you custom design?

122
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,030
Mike, you've done a lot of
these unmanned aerial vehicles

123
00:05:59,029 --> 00:05:59,599
and so forth.

124
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,730
Can you talk a
little bit about, you

125
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,890
know, what's the typical
fraction of COTS,

126
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:07,479
and how do you make that
decision when you design,

127
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,540
you know, a flying thing?

128
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,060


129
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,509
AUDIENCE: It really depends
on the scale and how robust.

130
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:16,490
The problem with COTS
in the unmanned world

131
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,422
is that you can easily
go to hobby grade parts.

132
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,880
And so if you want to get into
more of the commercial, kind

133
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,509
of more robust, almost
more like defense

134
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,509
kind of, like,
robustness and you know,

135
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,009
durability, you
really have to start

136
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,230
going to custom designed parts.

137
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,050
Because you know, if you
can do a whole design

138
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,218
space of, you know, all the
COTS parts, but you know,

139
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,759
they're always just
kind of, you now,

140
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,579
Chinese-made electric motors
and batteries, and none of them

141
00:06:43,579 --> 00:06:46,639
that will perform to,
like, commercial spec,

142
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,701
but it just depends, really,
what you need for the vehicle.

143
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,660
OLIVIER DE WECK: I see.

144
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,410
So what you're saying
is there's a gap.

145
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,439
You can get a lot of COTS stuff
at the hobby shop level, right?

146
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,879
So they're pretty affordable
but low reliability.

147
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,990
Or you have really high end,
very expensive, you know,

148
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,120
low production--

149
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,410
AUDIENCE: Like traditional
aerospace grade, yeah.

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,160
OLIVIER DE WECK: But there's
not much in the middle.

151
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,010
Is that what you're saying?

152
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:12,949
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

153
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,219
Yeah.

154
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,303
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

155
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:18,322
So you know, that's the
reality of detailed design

156
00:07:18,322 --> 00:07:19,280
that you're gonna face.

157
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,000
And surprisingly, in kind of
the formal system engineering

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,550
methodology, there's not
a lot of guidance on this.

159
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,790
There's not a lot of,
you know, guidance

160
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,010
to say what's the
optimal fraction

161
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,259
of commercial off
the shelf parts?

162
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,069
This is really something you
have to work out yourself,

163
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,790
and depending on, you know,
whether you're in aerospace

164
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:47,990
or medical devices or automotive
or making toothpaste, there's--

165
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,579
actually, yesterday
there was also

166
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:51,259
a big case study on diapers.

167
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,740
Diapers is a $3 billion
business, believe it or not.

168
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,275
And they were going
for-- their solution

169
00:07:57,274 --> 00:08:01,549
A was to go for a COTS solution,
you know, a lot of vendors.

170
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,500
And then they said, no.

171
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,990
It's just gonna give
us, sort of, average,

172
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,340
mediocre performance.

173
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:08,989
We want something much better.

174
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,259
So they went for a much
higher custom design solution.

175
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,649
Took them took them
a while to do it,

176
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,289
but it was worth it in the end.

177
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,160
So this is a big decision
you have to make.

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,050
So the point here
being, at the end,

179
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,516
you have a very detailed design.

180
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,350
You have blueprints.

181
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,906
You have something you
can actually build.

182
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:32,840
So you know, this is a list of
all the things you need to do.

183
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,841
You define the solution space,
develop your alternatives.

184
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:38,298
All the things
we've already talked

185
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,360
about at the conceptual level,
but you do this at every-- you

186
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,548
do it at the subsystem
level, and even

187
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:45,199
at the component level.

188
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,670
What are the alternate designs?

189
00:08:46,669 --> 00:08:48,759
Cost performance and schedule.

190
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,049
Select your design
solution, drive it down

191
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:54,409
to the lowest level of
detail, and then identify

192
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,889
the enabling products, which
would be like support equipment

193
00:08:57,889 --> 00:08:59,460
and things like this.

194
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,690
So the best illustration
I can give you

195
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,550
why this matters is these two
pictures I'm gonna show you.

196
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,039
The top picture
that you see here,

197
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:14,419
this is a picture that was drawn
in the '70s to sell the space

198
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,639
shuttle program to US Congress.

199
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,949
This was the vision, right?

200
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,500
This is the orbiter,
and you can see

201
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,250
it's sitting there in this
pristine hangar, right, very

202
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,820
clean, shiny floors,
maybe four or five people.

203
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,550
The payload bay is open.

204
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:35,179
There's, like, one or two carts
of ground support equipment.

205
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,969
You just load up your new
satellite, close the doors,

206
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,250
and off you go for
your next mission.

207
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,769
That's a reusable vehicle.

208
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:49,419
That's what we wanted, and then
what we actually got is this.

209
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:52,899
You can't even see
the orbiter, right?

210
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:54,549
But I promise you,
it's in there.

211
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,829
It's hidden in that scaffolding.

212
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,570
So this was the--
it's retired now,

213
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,750
but this was the orbiter
processing facility at the NASA

214
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,639
Kennedy Space Center.

215
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:07,750
And the reality was
that to turn around

216
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,190
an orbiter between flights
was almost like rebuilding it.

217
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,990
And the two subsystems that
required the most person hours

218
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,779
of work were the main engine--

219
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,199
the main engine basically had
to be disassembled and inspected

220
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,045
and so forth--

221
00:10:24,044 --> 00:10:25,294
and what was the other system?

222
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,969


223
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,974
What's that?

224
00:10:28,974 --> 00:10:29,890
AUDIENCE: Heat shield.

225
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:31,879
OLIVIER DE WECK: The
heat shield, the TPS,

226
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:33,889
thermal protection system--

227
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:35,159
if you've ever seen--

228
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,350
who's seen the shuttle close up?

229
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,420
OK, about half, half here.

230
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:42,699
At EPFL, who's had a
chance to see the space

231
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,470
shuttle, the orbiter, close up?

232
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,850
Anybody?

233
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,730
Go ahead.

234
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,173
AUDIENCE: One or two.

235
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:54,340
OLIVIER DE WECK: One or two.

236
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,899
So those of you
that have seen it,

237
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:58,299
what did you notice
about the heat shield?

238
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,519
Did you notice anything
about the protection,

239
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:03,927
the thermal protection system?

240
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:04,509
Who's seen it?

241
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,819


242
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,182
AUDIENCE: We do not
hear very well here.

243
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:13,639
OLIVIER DE WECK:
You can't hear me?

244
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:18,580


245
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,680
So the point I want
to make here is

246
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:24,709
that the thermal protection
system, every tile

247
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,879
is different.

248
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,480
Every tile has a different
shape, a different curvature,

249
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,810
and there were good
thermodynamic reasons,

250
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:36,059
aerothermodynamic
reasons for that,

251
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,409
but in terms of actually
designing, manufacturing,

252
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:43,339
and turning around the vehicle,
it was a nightmare, right?

253
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,330
So that it turned out to be
not a very reusable vehicle

254
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,350
in the end, and why?

255
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,180
Because a lot of
the detailed design

256
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:53,870
decisions ended
up being critical,

257
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,820
in terms of not really
giving us what we wanted,

258
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,980
in terms of macro level
properties of the vehicle.

259
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,879
So detailed design
really matters.

260
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,039
Did you get that point, at EPFL?

261
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,610
Is it clear?

262
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,639


263
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,308
AUDIENCE: It is.

264
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:15,600
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, thank you.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,680
So here's some--

266
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,889
I'm not going to go
through this in detail,

267
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:23,909
but here's some flow diagrams,
process flow diagrams,

268
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,039
from the System
Engineering Handbook

269
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,089
that essentially describe,
you know, how this works.

270
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,530
So your inputs are your baseline
logical decomposition model,

271
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:37,620
which is essentially your
system architecture, right?

272
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,190
And then your baseline derived,
your detailed technical

273
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,630
requirements.

274
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,778
You go through all
these processes,

275
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,320
through all these
steps, and then you

276
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,360
end up with a whole
bunch of outputs, which

277
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,620
are more detailed requirements.

278
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,379
The specifications,
do you remember,

279
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:58,200
we teased apart requirements
and specifications?

280
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,930
Requirements are what
the system should do.

281
00:13:00,929 --> 00:13:04,469
Requirement specifications are
how the system's actually been

282
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,600
designed, right, blueprints.

283
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,269
So that's specifications
at the subsystem level.

284
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:13,590
And then you get other things,
like a verification, validation

285
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,870
plan, and then logistics
and operating procedures.

286
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,970
So very, very detailed work.

287
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,120
The other thing that's
important is all the design

288
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,970
considerations that go
into making detailed design

289
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,580
decisions.

290
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:28,389
So here's a fairly
long list of them,

291
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:32,289
and you can group them into
performance, availability.

292
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,480
This is more related
to reliability.

293
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,710
So you could have a system that
has high nominal performance

294
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,650
but is poor reliability,
right, so it's not available

295
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:42,189
very much.

296
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,390
That's not good.

297
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,419
We want high performance
and high availability.

298
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:49,000
That gives you your
technical effectiveness.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,279
And then how do you
actually operate the system?

300
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,819
So operations,
maintenance, logistics,

301
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,320
so that's process efficiency.

302
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,107
Together, that gives you
system effectiveness.

303
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,939
And then, of course,
you have the total cost

304
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,820
of operating the system--
lifecycle cost, total ownership

305
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,660
cost.

306
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:06,610
And then system
effectiveness and cost

307
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,610
together, give you what's called
here affordable operational

308
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,960
effectiveness.

309
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,530
So I would argue, in terms
of the space shuttle program,

310
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:17,169
it had high system performance.

311
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:21,174
It had OK system availability.

312
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:23,549
They had-- definitely there
were some reliability issues,

313
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:26,979
but it was manageable, but
it had very poor process

314
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,110
efficiency--

315
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,750
operations, maintenance,
logistics very, very difficult.

316
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,830
So system effectiveness wasn't
that high, and as a result,

317
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,580
the lifecycle cost
was also very high.

318
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,400
There's a very
famous paper, where

319
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:43,740
after the shuttle
program was ended,

320
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,680
a lifecycle cost
analysis was done,

321
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:52,079
and it turned out that one
launch cost about $1.5 billion.

322
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,879
So during the program,
people would say,

323
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,639
oh, one launch is
maybe $500 million,

324
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,509
you know, the variable cost,
and the rest is fixed cost.

325
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:03,269
But once the program is done,
it doesn't matter anymore

326
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,159
whether it was fixed
or variable cost.

327
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,370
All you know is what was the
total cost of the program,

328
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,560
how many launches
did we actually do,

329
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,179
and you just take the ratio.

330
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,199
And it was $1.5 billion
per launch of the shuttle.

331
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,720
And so I would say
that's way off from what

332
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,129
the original target was.

333
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:22,110
Yeah, Veronica?

334
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,550
AUDIENCE: Does that number
account for crew and crew

335
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,049
training?

336
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,538


337
00:15:27,538 --> 00:15:28,830
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good question.

338
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,670
I think so.

339
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:33,059
I think it basically-- whatever
was appropriated by Congress

340
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,579
for the shuttle
program, and I think

341
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,190
that would include crew
operations, as well, yeah.

342
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,790
So I'm happy to point you
to that paper, actually.

343
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:44,329
Yes?

344
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:46,719
AUDIENCE: It also accounted
for R&D costs as well, right?

345
00:15:46,719 --> 00:15:48,260
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yes, that's correct.

346
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,000
It includes everything, all in.

347
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,399
R&D costs-- R&D
took about 10 years

348
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,539
and then operations
was about 30 years.

349
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,230


350
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,080
OK, so you see--

351
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,570
and of course, within
these are budget limits.

352
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,280
So part of the reason
why the shuttle didn't

353
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,139
have that high
process efficiency

354
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:14,519
was because the R&D budget
was capped pretty tightly.

355
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:16,470
So rather than
optimizing, you know,

356
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,470
for maintainability
and turnaround,

357
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,560
they said, we need to have
the system performance.

358
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,959
We need to have reasonable
system availability,

359
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,230
and then the rest, basically, is
we're gonna deal with it later.

360
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,159
So what effectively
happened is they capped

361
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,899
R&D cost, and as a result,
the lifecycle cost ballooned.

362
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,399
I would argue if
they had spent, you

363
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,610
know, two or three
more years optimizing,

364
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,200
you know, maintenance
and turn around,

365
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,160
really making it reusable,
the lifecycle costs could

366
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:52,189
have been much better, but
that's not how it worked.

367
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,580
So you have a lot of these
competing requirements.

368
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,770
And so I want to
just ask you this--

369
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,799
this is the first concept
question today, OK?

370
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,919
So imagine you're-- this
is a very detailed design.

371
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,108
This is just a bracket here, OK?

372
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:11,990
And this bracket was designed
so it has, like, a tip load.

373
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,108
Think of this as
a cantilever beam.

374
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:18,509
So it's attached on the
right side or left side here.

375
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,650
You have a load, and then
this is your displacement

376
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,140
under a given load.

377
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,250
And these three brackets
all have the same mass.

378
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,970
They use the same
amount of material, OK?

379
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,980
So you can think of this as you
get from the very simple design

380
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,829
to the more intricate design,
you have more design freedom.

381
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,149
So you get better performance.

382
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,660
You see the
displacement goes down,

383
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,710
but you also have
more complexity.

384
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,680
So it's more
difficult to optimize.

385
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,900
It's more difficult to
manufacture and so forth.

386
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,940
And so we can actually show
these three choices here

387
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,820
on a manufacturing
cost, per unit cost,

388
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:01,759
versus the displacement,
structural displacement

389
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,289
under load chart.

390
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,659
So our simple design,
our one bar design,

391
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,440
has a displacement of 2.5
millimeters under load,

392
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,090
and it costs about $2 to make.

393
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:16,159
The two-bar design has
much better performance,

394
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,990
like 0.75 or something like
that, costs about $3 to make.

395
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,569
And then this 17-bar
intricate design

396
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:28,669
has 0.6 millimeters, so the
best structural performance,

397
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,759
but its cost is
about $8 per piece.

398
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:34,910
So my question to you is
which of these three designs

399
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,210
would you select and why?

400
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,700
So if you could go to that
link, enter your answer,

401
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,299
and then we'll look
at the distribution.

402
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,180
So we have 39 responses.

403
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,750
That's good.

404
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,930
Ah, interesting.

405
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,700
OK.

406
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,430
So one of you said
you're gonna go

407
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,940
for the super-duper
17-bar design.

408
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:08,799
Most of you, 74%, said
the two-bar design.

409
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,409
And one of you said one bar.

410
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:15,040
And then eight of you,
20%, said you're not sure.

411
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,829
I guess you need more
information, right?

412
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:22,929
So who picked the one-bar
design, the simple design?

413
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:28,312
OK, so please explain
why you picked that.

414
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:29,769
AUDIENCE: Well,
for my application.

415
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,569
I'm planning on
mass producing them,

416
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,279
and it's for
something that doesn't

417
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,109
need the degree of displacement
that the other ones are doing,

418
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:43,179
and so I'm really only seeking
to minimize manufacturing cost,

419
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,180
and the one bar is the
easiest to manufacture

420
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,910
and also gives me
room down the road

421
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,490
to iterate if it's not working.

422
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,430
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so So what
would be an example, industry

423
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,279
or application?

424
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,379
AUDIENCE: Like a
children's toy, perhaps,

425
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:04,019
where you don't need very strict
requirements on displacement,

426
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:05,559
something that you're
mass producing.

427
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,684
OLIVIER DE WECK: Something
mass produced, you know,

428
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:10,740
for sort of lower requirements.

429
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,170
OK, I think that's
a valid answer.

430
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,390
Most of you said
the two-bar design.

431
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,800
So who said two bars?

432
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,190
Let's see at EPFL, who
picked the two-bar design?

433
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,700


434
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,400
AUDIENCE: Sure.

435
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,550
It gives you the biggest
biggest bang for your buck.

436
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:35,599
For not that much more cost, you
get a much more sturdy design

437
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,439
and that's compared
for the 17-bar one.

438
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,420
Really, it's still
pretty sturdy,

439
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,120
but you're paying much
less, so it seems optimal.

440
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,389
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so if
you think about this in a Pareto

441
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,870
sense, I mean, they're
all Pareto-optimal,

442
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:53,329
but this one is at the
knee of the curve, right?

443
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:57,309
So you're getting, you said
bang for your buck or value.

444
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:01,970
If you did, like, a displacement
or one over displacement,

445
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:07,039
I guess, per manufacturing cost,
this one would do pretty well.

446
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,759
So that's also a
very sensible answer.

447
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:16,740
Who picked the 17-bar design,
the really intricate one?

448
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,640
Who picked that?

449
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,910
Oh, I think I might have picked
that when I tried out the form.

450
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,090
[LAUGHS] I think so.

451
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:26,699
I can't remember now.

452
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,710
It's been already a while ago.

453
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,140
So if, indeed, I was the one,
so how would I justify this?

454
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:37,830
OK, so here this
bracket will go--

455
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,359


456
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,059
this will go on the
Mars 2020 Rover.

457
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:50,279
And the Rover will see a lot
of different thermal gradients.

458
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,160
You know, it has
to be very precise

459
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,560
because it holds
scientific instruments that

460
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,274
need to be, you know,
pointing very accurately.

461
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,019


462
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,210
Even though the mass here
is identical, but I think

463
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,110
we could shrink this.

464
00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:06,839
You know, we get the best
performance structurally

465
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,869
for the mass constraint
that we were allocated.

466
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,769
And cost, you know, this
is all taxpayer dollars,

467
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,509
so this is a government program.

468
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:17,220
So we can spend the money.

469
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,860
Of course, I don't
mean that really,

470
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:22,819
but it is a high-performance
application.

471
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:26,119
Therefore, even though
the benefit is only small,

472
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,329
that small benefit
is worth it when

473
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,579
you look at the whole mission.

474
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:31,949
So we're we're going
to pay for that,

475
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:35,410
and we're going to go for
this high-performance design.

476
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,900
Do you see how that works?

477
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,900
So the right answer--

478
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,780
and I think a lot of you said,
you know, you're not sure,

479
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:43,250
and it's because--

480
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,930
who said you're not sure?

481
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,778
Nathan.

482
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:49,319
AUDIENCE: I said
not sure because you

483
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,789
don't know all
the specifications

484
00:22:50,789 --> 00:22:53,789
or what the tolerances are
or any other information that

485
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,531
would lead you to
make that decision.

486
00:22:55,531 --> 00:22:57,240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
so you know, what

487
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,500
are the requirements, right?

488
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
We don't know the
requirements here.

489
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,519
Are the requirements shall
or should requirements?

490
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:05,519
If it's a shall
requirement, what it means

491
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,134
is there would be some
hard limit here, right?

492
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:12,569
The displacement shall be
less than one millimeter.

493
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,529
If that's a hard requirement,
then this solution falls out,

494
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,849
does not satisfy.

495
00:23:17,849 --> 00:23:19,769
And if it's a
should requirement,

496
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,410
then it's a goal that
you're gonna trade off.

497
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,750
The point I want to
make here, this lecture

498
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,460
is about detailed design.

499
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,920
This is detailed design, right?

500
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,400
And you're gonna make hundreds
or thousands of detailed design

501
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,580
decisions just like this
bracket and together,

502
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:37,889
they're gonna give you, you
know, the performance cost

503
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,140
of your whole system.

504
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,330
And so every detailed
design decision

505
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:46,019
you make needs to be informed
by the requirements but also

506
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,589
the trade-offs between
these properties.

507
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:51,519
Does that make sense?

508
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:52,980
OK.

509
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,049
So and that leads
us-- and so you

510
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,240
want to make sure you
optimize your system.

511
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,680
You want to make sure you get--

512
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,900
and I liked, Katya, the
way you said it-- get

513
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,280
the bang for your buck, right?

514
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,589
You want to make sure you don't
have a lot of inefficiencies

515
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:08,470
in your design.

516
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,289
So that's what MDO is about.

517
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:14,859
So let me go to MDO
here, what it is.

518
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:18,899
So there's a technical committee
in AIAA, the American Institute

519
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,340
for Aeronautics
and Astronautics,

520
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:25,619
that was founded
about 20 years ago.

521
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,779
So it's defined as an evolving
methodology, a body of methods,

522
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,430
techniques, algorithms,
and related application

523
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,039
practices for the design
of engineering systems,

524
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,649
coupled by physical
phenomena and involving

525
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,740
many interacting
subsystems and parts.

526
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,049
So the main things
you need to do MDO

527
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:48,329
are a mathematical model of the
system, analysis capability,

528
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:50,849
and in some cases,
approximation concepts.

529
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,500
So what that means is not--

530
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
if you put all this together,
it could be very, very slow

531
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,779
and computationally heavy.

532
00:24:56,779 --> 00:24:59,250
So you might approximate
some of these things,

533
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,559
and I'll explain
a couple examples.

534
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,490
Sensitivity analysis,
optimization processes,

535
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,670
and a human interface-- those
are the main ingredients

536
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,240
of MDO.

537
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,250


538
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,609
Who's seen this chart before?

539
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:16,799
OK, about three or four of you.

540
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:23,029
Who's seen this chart before at
EPFL, this particular graphic?

541
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:26,509
Anybody seen this before?

542
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:27,890
AUDIENCE: Apparently, no one.

543
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:29,514
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
so let me explain.

544
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:33,589
This is a cartoon, OK, and
I've experienced this myself

545
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:36,439
working at McDonnell
Douglas in the '90s.

546
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,430
So each of these
airplanes shown here

547
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,500
is what the airplane
would look like

548
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,400
if that particular
discipline or group could

549
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,160
call all the shots, OK?

550
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,720
So let's look at
a couple of these.

551
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,890
So the controls group is
all about controllability.

552
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,030
So you see the flight control
surfaces are very big.

553
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:03,859
Now, the problem
is the linkages,

554
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:07,009
you know, these control
linkages are on the outside.

555
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,869
That's really bad
for aerodynamics,

556
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:14,259
but the controls people say,
I don't care about drag.

557
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:17,089
I need to make sure my
control surfaces are

558
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:18,789
deflecting appropriately.

559
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,480
Here's the hydraulics
group, right?

560
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,470
It's all about the
hydraulic pump, the filters,

561
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,480
and getting hydraulic
pressure to all

562
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,039
the different subsystems.

563
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:30,649
You know, the big engine
here, the power plant group,

564
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,990
the engine is the
most important thing.

565
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,089
The loft group-- loft means--

566
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:37,099
lofting is surfaces.

567
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:39,629
You're dealing with
the shape of surfaces.

568
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,030
So let's keep this simple.

569
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,309
So we have a little,
you know, balsa airplane

570
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:48,500
with little straight
surfaces, very easy for loft.

571
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,769
Production is kind of similar.

572
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:55,490
The aerodynamics group wants
a very nice high aspect ratio

573
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,120
wing, very thin, very low drag.

574
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,809
Problem is, there's no room
for passengers or cargo here.

575
00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:05,359
You see this, the stress group?

576
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,949
They have a nice wing here
in the shape of an I-beam.

577
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,930
I-beams are great, you know,
this is good if you're a civil

578
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:14,390
engineer but not so much--

579
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,800
none of these things
would work on their own.

580
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,399
So what we really
want is something

581
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,540
like this, where all
these considerations are

582
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:28,339
blended and optimized so we get
a high-performance system not

583
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,619
just a high-performance
subsystem.

584
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,250
Said another way, a
high-performance system

585
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:38,720
is not the same as just a
sum of individually optimized

586
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,100
subsystems.

587
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,009
That's, in a nutshell,
what MDO is about.

588
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:47,000
So one of the readings
for today, post readings,

589
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,414
is this paper, 6A.

590
00:27:49,414 --> 00:27:53,420
And this is based on a big
workshop we had in Germany

591
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,302
about five years ago.

592
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,259
That's actually longer.

593
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:58,849
It's probably seven
years ago by now,

594
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:01,189
but the paper came
out five years ago

595
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,074
called, "MDO, Assessment and
Direction for Advancement."

596
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,740
And this is a pretty
international group

597
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,480
that put this together.

598
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
And what we do in the paper,
we describe the history

599
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,689
of multidisciplinary
optimization, where

600
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,330
it is today, where it's heading,
and some of the key milestones.

601
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:23,240
So this chart is essentially
a kind of history of MDO.

602
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,519
I'm just gonna point
out a few things.

603
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,460
The roots of MDO are in
structural optimization.

604
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,519
So you saw the bracket
with all those--

605
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:35,839
so there's actually a field
called structural optimization

606
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,589
or topology optimization,
and it's very mature now.

607
00:28:39,589 --> 00:28:43,289
So you can buy, in some
of the CAD packages,

608
00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:47,450
there's some specialized tools
for optimizing structures.

609
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,600
And when you look at it,
it looks like Swiss cheese

610
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,719
with big holes, an
Emmentaler, big holes.

611
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,759
You don't need a
lot of structure

612
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,180
that doesn't do work for you.

613
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,019
So a lot of these
structures look like webs,

614
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:02,930
and the reason is
because the load

615
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,090
path has been highly optimized.

616
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:09,301
For example, if you
look at the A380--

617
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,759
I don't have a
picture right here--

618
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:17,319
but you can look at an A380 wing
spars and different structures.

619
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,000


620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,390
They have more
holes than structure

621
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,680
because they've been
highly optimized.

622
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,930
So that's the roots of
MDO, starting in the 1960s.

623
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:33,769
Then, I would say, in the '80s,
mid-'80s, we started having

624
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:36,680
more complex
decomposition techniques,

625
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,180
and I will describe one
of these to you today.

626
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,220
Optimization
algorithms were started

627
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,279
to be built into
mainstream programs

628
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:50,609
like Excel, MATLAB, Mathematica.

629
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:56,009
And then more recently,
you know, in the 2000s,

630
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:59,654
we had commercialization
of multilevel algorithms,

631
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:01,904
and the one that I'll describe
to you is called BLISS.

632
00:30:01,904 --> 00:30:06,250


633
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,039
So let's talk through a very
specific example, and then

634
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,099
one of those techniques.

635
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:13,379
So here's the example.

636
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,690
You're designing a wing,
and in designing a wing,

637
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:22,519
the two main considerations
are structural and aerodynamic.

638
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:25,970
So here's a simplified wing.

639
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,019
It has a wing area,
it has a sweep angle,

640
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:33,119
it has an aspect
ratio, and so forth.

641
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:36,109
And there's loads
acting on the wing

642
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:38,509
as you're flying
because of the pressure

643
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:40,769
differential between the
upper and lower surface.

644
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:45,950
So there's some net force,
P, acting on this wing.

645
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,700
And as a result of that,
the wing will warp.

646
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,690
So you will have some
twist angle in the wing,

647
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,570
and that's just due to the
structural deformation.

648
00:30:56,569 --> 00:31:01,639
So that twist angle and
the displacements, in turn,

649
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,990
will change the drag that
the wing experiences.

650
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,120
So the lift and drag
of the wing will change

651
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:10,179
as a function of twist angle.

652
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,799
But as the lift and drag
change, the loads, of course,

653
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:20,190
then change as well, and it
feeds back into the structure.

654
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,779
And in this case, what we're
looking for is maximum range.

655
00:31:23,779 --> 00:31:27,049
We want to maximize the
range of the airplane.

656
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:30,409
And this is a sort
of simplified version

657
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,259
of the range equation, the
so-called Breguet range

658
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:34,529
equation.

659
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:38,450
And you can see that
the structure influences

660
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,450
the range in two ways--
directly by weight,

661
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,430
the actual weight
of the structure

662
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:48,170
enters here twice in the range
equation, and then indirectly

663
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,509
through its stiffness, right?

664
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:53,000
The softer it is, the more
displacements, the more

665
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,779
you affect the drag.

666
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:59,599
So it's not so clear then
what is an optimal wing?

667
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:01,699
Is it the lightest
wing possible?

668
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,330
But the lightest wing possible
will have a larger twist

669
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:09,740
and may have more drag, which
will reduce your range, right?

670
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:13,599
So should you optimize
the wing for lightness

671
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,349
or for this minimum
displacement or some combination

672
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:19,879
or mix of the two?

673
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,670
And the answer, of course,
is it's a mix of the two.

674
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,009
There will be a
sweet spot somewhere,

675
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,470
you know, between a very
stiff and very heavy

676
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,329
wing and a very, very
flexible, lightweight wing.

677
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:34,250
There will be some
optimal mix of the two,

678
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,859
and that's the key here.

679
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:40,429
So let me discuss
with you briefly--

680
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,820
this is just one of the methods.

681
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:45,109
There are several methods for
doing multidisciplinary design

682
00:32:45,109 --> 00:32:46,879
optimization, but
this is one of them

683
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,320
called BLISS, Bi-Level
Integrated Systems Synthesis.

684
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,169
And the general idea
here in this method

685
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:59,420
is that we have a lower level
optimization of each subsystem

686
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,840
but it's coupled through a
system level optimization.

687
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:05,599
And what you want is, you
know, an optimal design

688
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,109
at the system level, not
just optimal subsystems.

689
00:33:09,109 --> 00:33:11,869
So the context
here is we're gonna

690
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:15,739
design a high speed, a
supersonic business jet.

691
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,109
It's kind of shown
in this gray picture.

692
00:33:19,109 --> 00:33:22,199
And we have four
major subsystems

693
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,640
we're gonna consider--
propulsion, aerodynamics,

694
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,100
structures, and then
the performance, which,

695
00:33:28,099 --> 00:33:30,889
in this case, is range, OK?

696
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:35,120
And what's important here in
decomposing the problem is

697
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,279
the x's and the y's.

698
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,193
Now, the x's are the
design variables.

699
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:41,359
Do you remember, we talk
about the design variables,

700
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,089
the knobs you can
turn as a designer?

701
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:46,939
And so these here
are-- the upper ones,

702
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,730
we call them local design
variables, you know,

703
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:53,360
like the throttle setting, the
tail sweep, the wing moment

704
00:33:53,359 --> 00:34:00,079
arm, the thickness of the
wings, the taper ratio.

705
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,629
So the idea of a
local design variable

706
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:07,010
is that design variable only is
used in one of the subsystems.

707
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,610
It's local to that subsystem.

708
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:16,429
So you basically can choose
that in each of the subsystems,

709
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:19,159
and it doesn't really
affect directly

710
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,619
any of the other
subsystems-- indirectly, yes,

711
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:23,599
but not directly.

712
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,130
And then we have the y's here.

713
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:30,000
The y's are the outputs from
one subsystem to another.

714
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,940
So drag, lift, NZ is
your maximum load factor,

715
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,360
your range, your specific fuel
consumption, your wing twist,

716
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,510
and so forth.

717
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,250
So those are outputs from a
subsystem or discipline that

718
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,170
either matter at
the system level

719
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,550
or are required as inputs
by another subsystem.

720
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:52,580
And then finally, the
last group here, these

721
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,009
are known as the shared
design variables,

722
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,470
so the wing aspect
ratio, the altitude,

723
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:01,459
mach number, wing sweep.

724
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:05,920
Those are basically required
by more than one subsystem, so

725
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,050
two, three, or
four, in this case.

726
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,980
Then they are considered
as shared variables,

727
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,969
and they would be considered
system level variables

728
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:19,539
because they matter for
more than one subsystem.

729
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:22,750
So what this
particular method does

730
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:25,449
is essentially
decompose the problem

731
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:28,899
into the various subsystems,
so in this case, again,

732
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,329
aerodynamics, propulsion,
structures, and range.

733
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:36,610
And these subsystems are sending
this information to each other

734
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,430
and are all tied together
at the highest level

735
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,559
through the shared
variables, the shared design

736
00:35:41,559 --> 00:35:45,759
variables that are shared
by at least two subsystems.

737
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,590
So again, local
variables are only

738
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,490
unique to a specific subsystem,
and then for the wise,

739
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,519
these outputs, internal
outputs, there's

740
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:58,300
a distinction between
the Y stars, which

741
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,750
are coupling variables that are
input to a particular subsystem

742
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,360
and then the Y hats
are coupling variables

743
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,990
that are output from a
particular subsystem.

744
00:36:07,989 --> 00:36:12,609
So let's zoom in now on
just one of the subsystems,

745
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,000
let's say, aerodynamics,
and see how this works.

746
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,800
So here we're zooming
in on one subsystem,

747
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,750
and that's the aerodynamics.

748
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,699
And the idea that
you can actually

749
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:29,480
optimize just the aerodynamic
subsystem by itself.

750
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,929
So what are the inputs into it?

751
00:36:31,929 --> 00:36:40,389
We have aspect ratio, wing
twist, and W. So what is W?

752
00:36:40,389 --> 00:36:42,480
And this is key to this
particular method--

753
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,429
the W are the
weights, the weights

754
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:47,750
that you give to the outputs.

755
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:52,599
So what you're optimizing here
is some objective function, f,

756
00:36:52,599 --> 00:37:01,779
shown here below, which is W1,
Y1, plus W2, Y2 plus W3, Y3.

757
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,460
So you're either maximizing
or minimizing that.

758
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,409
And what is this here?

759
00:37:05,409 --> 00:37:09,460
It's lift, drag, and
the lift to drag ratio.

760
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,099
So what's really cool
about this method is

761
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:17,049
that what it essentially
is telling the subsystem

762
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,340
is how to properly weight these
different outputs in order

763
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,890
to optimize the
subsystem, taking into

764
00:37:23,889 --> 00:37:27,139
account the system
level objective.

765
00:37:27,139 --> 00:37:29,349
So the weights are
not pre-defined,

766
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:33,309
but the weights themselves
are a design variable.

767
00:37:33,309 --> 00:37:35,949
And so you can see the
formulation on the right side.

768
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:41,960
So given Q, which is
your shared variables,

769
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,929
the Y stars, which
are the inputs

770
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,779
from the other subsystems,
and the weights,

771
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,820
minimize your objective function
by varying your local design

772
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,660
variables subject to a
bunch of constraints, OK?

773
00:37:56,659 --> 00:38:00,489
And so what is one
of the consequences

774
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,829
of being able to formulate
the problem this way?

775
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:07,329
So this could be a very high
fidelity, aerodynamics model,

776
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,799
computational fluid dynamics,
or it could be what?

777
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,410


778
00:38:15,409 --> 00:38:18,710
Or it could be a lower
fidelity code, right?

779
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,099
As long as the inputs and
the outputs are the same,

780
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:27,199
you can now plug in, you know,
different fidelity levels

781
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:31,009
of analysis, you know
something simple or something

782
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:33,470
based on experimental
results, you

783
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:36,889
know, panel method,
very high fidelity CFD.

784
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:38,960
This becomes very modular.

785
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,550
The other thing
you can do is you

786
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:44,700
can pre-compute a lot of
these responses, right?

787
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,159
So for a given
set of inputs, you

788
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:53,190
can pre-compute over a whole
range of input variables

789
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,039
what the response of
that subsystem will be,

790
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,289
and you can store
that information

791
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:00,840
and then use what are
known approximation

792
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,570
methods, like response
surface models,

793
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:06,900
to save that information,
such that when

794
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,980
you do the full
system optimization,

795
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,090
you don't have to rerun,
you know, the detailed codes

796
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,809
every time.

797
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,039
You can just pull
from the approximation

798
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:18,389
you've pre-computed already.

799
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,519
So that's one of the
really powerful things

800
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,119
about this method.

801
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,880
And that's what's shown
here, is you substitute--

802
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,700
you have a series of
approximation models, one

803
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,710
for each of the
outputs of the system.

804
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:32,579
You see that?

805
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,860
So these little
wiggly things here

806
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,200
are essentially an
approximation of

807
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,099
that input/output relationship
at the subsystem level.

808
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,730
Could be an empirical function,
a neural network, a response

809
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,539
surface method, or you
know, simplified engineering

810
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:49,860
analysis.

811
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,400
So you do a lot of this
work offline ahead of time

812
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,590
for each of the subsystems.

813
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,059
Does that make sense?

814
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,980
Any questions at EPFL?

815
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,340
Is that clear how this
works, at least in theory?

816
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,960


817
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,519
AUDIENCE: Everything's
fine, thanks.

818
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:12,500
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so what
we have now is essentially

819
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:17,570
these subsystem approximations,
and now we can use them

820
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,470
for system level optimization.

821
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:23,769
So now let's look at the
system level optimization.

822
00:40:23,769 --> 00:40:27,429
So that's essentially
given approximation

823
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:30,969
models for optimized
subsystem outputs,

824
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,069
we want to minimize
some objective function.

825
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,920
So F, here in this case, which
is a function of our shared

826
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:45,820
variables, our relevant outputs,
Y star, and the weighting

827
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,370
factors, right, the omega--

828
00:40:48,369 --> 00:40:51,759
not the omegas, the W's, which
are the weighting factors given

829
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,920
to each of the subsystems.

830
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,670
And we of course, have
to satisfy constraints

831
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,079
at the system level.

832
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,779
So let me show you an example
then of what this looks like.

833
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:09,250
So here's our supersonic jet.

834
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,590
This is our cycle zero,
our initial condition.

835
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,890
Here's the planned
form of the jet,

836
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,900
and I'm going to show
you down here range

837
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,160
and just one of the design
variables, or a set of design

838
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:24,199
variables, which is our
wing box sheet thickness.

839
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:29,319
So you go through this, and
it converges after 10 cycles

840
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,340
already.

841
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:34,660
So this is what our business
jet looks like after 10 cycles.

842
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,049
And you know, you see there's
a pretty big difference.

843
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,360
So the fuselage is much longer.

844
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,809
This by the way, this is
the same in ships, right?

845
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:46,900
Your speed that you can
reach, your max speed

846
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,039
is driven by your fuselage
length, your water length.

847
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:54,429
You can see the wings have
a pretty high sweep angle.

848
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:58,059
This is a supersonic jet.

849
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:00,369
And if we look at
the details, we

850
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:03,519
see that the range
here, the range

851
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:07,960
is about 3,000 nautical
miles, and what

852
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,920
you see is that the exact
range that can be achieved

853
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,210
and the approximate range merge.

854
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,849
So the approximation models
that you have in this method

855
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:19,900
are only approximate.

856
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,430
There's some error.

857
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:23,949
And you know, as you run
the model several times,

858
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:26,049
several iterations,
the difference

859
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,710
between the approximation and
the actual high fidelity result

860
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,309
gets less and less, so that
it's actually a feasible design.

861
00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,340
And then over here, we see
the different thicknesses

862
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,769
for the inner wing
box, the mid span wing

863
00:42:39,769 --> 00:42:41,900
box, and the outer wing box.

864
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,320
And you can see that early
on in the first four or five

865
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,840
six iterations, things
are kind of moving around,

866
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,570
but then they're settling out.

867
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:54,190
And so for this maximum
objective of range,

868
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:59,289
you can see that the inner, mid,
and outer wing box thicknesses

869
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:01,159
are quite different.

870
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:04,929
So that's the general idea
here is that this result--

871
00:43:04,929 --> 00:43:10,629
this is a fairly detailed design
was produced based on a system

872
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,450
level optimization that
included consideration

873
00:43:13,449 --> 00:43:18,369
of aerodynamic structures,
propulsion, and so forth.

874
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:19,869
And there are several
other methods,

875
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:23,170
but this is just one
of the methods that's

876
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,010
been actually quite helpful.

877
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,130
The challenges now in MDO,
in this multidisciplinary

878
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:32,530
optimization are
different trade-offs.

879
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,920
So one trade-off is between
fidelity versus how expensive

880
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:38,289
is it computationally.

881
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,759
So fidelity is over here.

882
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,580
So high fidelity
means, you know,

883
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:45,969
3D finite element model
analysis, computational fluid

884
00:43:45,969 --> 00:43:46,998
dynamics.

885
00:43:46,998 --> 00:43:48,789
Then you have sort of
intermediate fidelity

886
00:43:48,789 --> 00:43:51,610
or low fidelity
empirical models.

887
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:55,059
And then on this axis, we
have just doing trade studies,

888
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:57,070
meaning you have sort
of a baseline design

889
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,960
and you just explore from
that baseline design.

890
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,460
You do limited optimization
or iteration or full MDO,

891
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,769
exploring the full space.

892
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:08,230
And traditionally,
you had to choose,

893
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,300
am I gonna use high
fidelity models?

894
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,850
But then I can only
look at a few points.

895
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:16,210
So then the question
is can you do better?

896
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,730
Is there a better
solution out there?

897
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,760
Or you can do lower
fidelity models

898
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,610
and explore the design
space very widely,

899
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:26,050
and then the
question is, can you

900
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:28,510
believe the results
because you've done

901
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:31,360
this with approximate models?

902
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,840
So the real challenge here is we
would like to do high fidelity

903
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,370
and explore the
full design space.

904
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:40,750
So that's one of the big
research areas in MDO

905
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:45,730
is high fidelity but also very
computationally efficient.

906
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:49,159
And then the other
challenge is quite similar.

907
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:52,149
So it's again the
fidelity here, but then

908
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:54,730
should you just focus
on one subsystem?

909
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,070
How many of the subsystems,
including, you know,

910
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,150
the financial, operations,
manufacturing considerations,

911
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,950
so how many of those
subsystems do you

912
00:45:02,949 --> 00:45:06,129
include in your optimization?

913
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,930
And so you know, ideally, you'd
like to do the complete system,

914
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:13,599
but then you may
have to sacrifice

915
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,739
on some of the fidelity.

916
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:19,439
So that's the breadth
versus depth trade-off.

917
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,860
OK so any questions about--

918
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,640
I know this was very fast.

919
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:30,449
I do not expect you, by the
way, for assignment four or five

920
00:45:30,449 --> 00:45:33,839
to do MDO on your CanSat.

921
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,950
This is really more to give
you a feeling for, you know,

922
00:45:37,949 --> 00:45:40,859
how far things
have come and some

923
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,420
of the computational
frameworks that

924
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,980
exist to get you to a really
fine tuned optimized design.

925
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,050
If you are interested
in this, you know,

926
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,910
we have the spring class.

927
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:56,399
And you know, I hadn't offered
this class at EPFL in the past,

928
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,099
but we actually do
offer a distance version

929
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:00,809
with the SDM program.

930
00:46:00,809 --> 00:46:03,889
So there may be an option to
do this at a distance as well.

931
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,190
We'll discuss it.

932
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,860
But any questions about MDO?

933
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:11,550
What it is, how it works,
at least in principle?

934
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:14,160
Has anybody done
MDO kind of work?

935
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:16,346
Sam, go ahead

936
00:46:16,347 --> 00:46:18,180
AUDIENCE: I just had
one question about if--

937
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:21,919
so here, we're looking at
optimizing on one attribute, so

938
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,849
range, but if we have
multiple attributes,

939
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,279
it's still up to
someone to decide

940
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,340
how important those
attributes are in the end.

941
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's correct.

942
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,630
That is exactly
right, unless you

943
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:40,039
have a way to combine all these
into one objective function.

944
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:43,179
And to be blatant
about it, to be-- you

945
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:47,079
know, in the commercial
world, that's actually clear.

946
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:50,549
It's profit or
net present value.

947
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,740
So if you're designing
a commercial product

948
00:46:53,739 --> 00:46:58,219
in a competitive
industry, you can actually

949
00:46:58,219 --> 00:47:00,879
pretty easily combine
all this into a long--

950
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,780
you know, as long as you include
sort of the key drivers of,

951
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:07,880
you know, your
manufacturing costs.

952
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,970
If the product is not as
optimal and not as performant,

953
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:14,639
well, probably, you're not
gonna be as successful.

954
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:16,304
Your market share
might be lower.

955
00:47:16,304 --> 00:47:17,720
So in the commercial
world, people

956
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:21,799
are doing MDO with profitability
as the ultimate objective

957
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,000
function.

958
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,469
Now, for situations where it's
not about profit necessarily,

959
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:32,625
but it's about a bunch
of other considerations,

960
00:47:32,626 --> 00:47:34,000
then you can't
easily combine it.

961
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,960
You can still do utility.

962
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,650
You can do a utility, you
know, combine it in utility.

963
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:42,019
But I agree with you, I think
a good practice is then,

964
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:44,929
in that case, to do
the multi-objective,

965
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:47,629
and then you're gonna have
a bunch of solutions that

966
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,750
are all non-dominated, right?

967
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,150
And then it's a human
decision making process

968
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,184
to pick among those.

969
00:47:56,184 --> 00:47:58,090
Any other questions or comments?

970
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,500
What about at EPFL?

971
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,360
MDO, anybody have
experience with this before,

972
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,660
multidisciplinary
design optimization?

973
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:09,531


974
00:48:09,532 --> 00:48:11,019
AUDIENCE: OK, no one, again.

975
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:13,900
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
that's all right.

976
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,619
So just to tell you, this is
really a big deal in practice.

977
00:48:17,619 --> 00:48:20,500
So you know, the structural
optimization has been around,

978
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,429
that's pretty standard
practice, and you know,

979
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:26,799
optimizing control systems.

980
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,150
So we've optimized individual
subsystems for a long time now,

981
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,690
at least two or three decades,
but optimizing at the system

982
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:36,619
level is relatively new.

983
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:39,670
And I think the best companies,
the best organizations that

984
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,150
are out there, they're really
investing in this technology,

985
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:44,809
and they're quite good at it.

986
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:47,110
And that's where you can
really distinguish yourself

987
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:49,620
from the competition.

988
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:53,199
So let's talk about
concurrent design facilities.

989
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,849
And so I'm actually going to
use some material here from EPFL

990
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:00,489
because they have
a very nice CDF,

991
00:49:00,489 --> 00:49:03,909
and I want to give
credit here to Dr. Anton

992
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:09,670
Ivanov at the Swiss Space Center
for some of this material.

993
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,380
And actually one of the papers
is also related to this.

994
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,309
Anton used to be at JPL.

995
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:21,400
He worked at JPL for close to
a decade before going to EPFL.

996
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,940
So what is a CDF, a
concurrent design facility?

997
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:27,010
It's essentially an
environment where

998
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,600
engineers of
different disciplines

999
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,730
come together to
perform, you know,

1000
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,130
a system engineering
study for a project.

1001
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,740
Key elements that you need
is the team, the process,

1002
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,509
the physical environment,
which includes

1003
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:40,690
the A/V and the software,
and then also some way

1004
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,970
to do knowledge
management, meaning

1005
00:49:42,969 --> 00:49:48,730
capturing the results of prior
studies and ongoing studies.

1006
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,929
And I'll show you
some examples of CDFs.

1007
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:54,619
We also do this in academia.

1008
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,889
There's challenges for
doing this in academia,

1009
00:49:56,889 --> 00:49:59,529
a short learning curve, you
know, synchronizing this

1010
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,390
with the academic
schedule, and then

1011
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:06,559
a lot of turnover, of course, as
students graduate and so forth.

1012
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,230
So there's challenges.

1013
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,789
And in practice, what we
essentially have is, in a CDF,

1014
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:18,050
we have a set of models that
are linked to each other.

1015
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:20,200
And these models can
be, for example, here's

1016
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,309
some Simulink models shown.

1017
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:27,519
Here, there is
some Excel models.

1018
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:29,139
You can have CAD.

1019
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:31,750
And one of the tricks is, you
know, to link this together

1020
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,230
in a way that you can quickly
execute different designs

1021
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,869
and look at the
results from that.

1022
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,119
So in industrial settings,
probably the most famous CDF

1023
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,539
is the one at JPL, at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

1024
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:52,599
called Team X. Team X has been
around for about 20 years,

1025
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:58,900
and they just had an anniversary
where they celebrated

1026
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:05,559
their 1000th study that was
done at Team X. A typical Team X

1027
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:07,779
study is about a week.

1028
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,570
So you do a little
bit of preparation,

1029
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:14,110
but people work together in
the facility for about a week,

1030
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,300
and at the end of
the week, you have

1031
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,970
basically a conceptual design
pretty well worked out.

1032
00:51:21,969 --> 00:51:23,869
And the results have
been impressive.

1033
00:51:23,869 --> 00:51:26,469
So studies have shown
that the cost estimates

1034
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:30,549
that Team X came up with were
within 10% of final mission

1035
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:34,539
costs, for those missions that
were actually built and flown.

1036
00:51:34,539 --> 00:51:38,710
So of the 1,000 studies that
Team X did, a handful of them

1037
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:40,820
were actual flight missions.

1038
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,960
But every proposal
that is written

1039
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,480
starts now as a Team X study.

1040
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,119
So it's really a big deal.

1041
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:57,309
The European Space Agency
ESTEC has a similar facility

1042
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,360
in Noordwijk in the Netherlands.

1043
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,019
As well, all the ESA projects
are going through their CDF.

1044
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:06,099
So one of these is
[INAUDIBLE] which

1045
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:09,429
is a space-based observatory.

1046
00:52:09,429 --> 00:52:11,349
EPFL is involved
in that project.

1047
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:15,289
That went through
the CDF as well.

1048
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:19,420
Most NASA centers and then
commercial applications

1049
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,730
in medical devices,
painting, shipbuilding.

1050
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,740
And like I mentioned
in my introduction,

1051
00:52:23,739 --> 00:52:26,349
even consumer packaged
good companies

1052
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:29,920
are now building their
version of a CDF,

1053
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,550
such that they can, you know,
very quickly, within a couple

1054
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,590
weeks, come up with a new
proposal for a product and all

1055
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,140
the major aspects, you
know, the underlying physics

1056
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:45,650
and chemistry, the packaging,
the business case, everything

1057
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,490
is considered at the same time.

1058
00:52:48,489 --> 00:52:49,629
Yes?

1059
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:51,532
AUDIENCE: I was wondering why--

1060
00:52:51,532 --> 00:52:55,550
what makes the cost estimate
so accurate with this method?

1061
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:58,160
OLIVIER DE WECK: So there
are three major ways

1062
00:52:58,159 --> 00:52:59,839
of doing-- oh,
Veronica should answer

1063
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,500
that question, since
she's launching on cost

1064
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,809
modeling for her research.

1065
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:08,346
There are three major
cost estimation methods.

1066
00:53:08,346 --> 00:53:10,969
One is bottom up, you know, you
have the product decomposition,

1067
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:13,099
and you add up all the costs.

1068
00:53:13,099 --> 00:53:16,099
One is called
costing by analogy,

1069
00:53:16,099 --> 00:53:18,980
where you look at a prior
mission or a prior product

1070
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,929
and then you look at the deltas.

1071
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:23,960
And then the third one is
based on so-called CERs,

1072
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,000
cost estimation relationships.

1073
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,650
It's a parametric method.

1074
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:29,570
You can also blend these.

1075
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,930
And you know, I think one of
the reasons why it's accurate

1076
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:34,129
is because--

1077
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,880
there are two reasons
why, I would say.

1078
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,410
So you always have a cost share.

1079
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:41,389
One of the subsystems
is costing.

1080
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:44,440
So you have really people who
been doing this for a while.

1081
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:47,659
They know these
models, and so there's

1082
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,389
some legacy information.

1083
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:55,069
And the more missions we fly,
the more products we make,

1084
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:58,880
the more robust, essentially,
these cost estimates become.

1085
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,650
And then the second, I think,
is because people that typically

1086
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,430
work in a CDF,
they're non-advocates,

1087
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:09,949
meaning it's kind
of neutral ground.

1088
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:12,139
So rather than pushing
a particular idea

1089
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,659
or trying to be
overly optimistic,

1090
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:18,289
you know, usually in a
CDF, the calculations

1091
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:21,469
that are done are
pretty non-biased,

1092
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:23,759
and that's not always the case.

1093
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,152
So that's one of the advantages
of the CDF is you're getting--

1094
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:29,360
you know, people are trying
to say, but really, let's

1095
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,590
make it look a little better.

1096
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,170
No, no, we can't do this,
because the model says,

1097
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:38,510
you know, it is gonna cost $280
million to do this satellite.

1098
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,910
And that's based on, you
know, within prior models,

1099
00:54:41,909 --> 00:54:43,670
and if you overlay
different models,

1100
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:46,550
you know, with some
error or confidence.

1101
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,360
That's the right answer.

1102
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,490
So it's these two reasons.

1103
00:54:49,489 --> 00:54:54,469
There's experience, there's
data, and non-advocacy, really

1104
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:58,009
taking a kind of neutral,
unbiased position.

1105
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,430
So benefits are, you know,
improvements of quality,

1106
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:04,969
quick turnaround for ideas,
better cost estimates,

1107
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:09,719
and then increased creativity
and productivity in a company.

1108
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:11,730
So let me give you a
couple examples here.

1109
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,000
This is a CubeSat.

1110
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,530
So this is the ability to
design quickly new CubeSats.

1111
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,030
This picture here
I'm showing you

1112
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:23,510
is the Swiss Cube that was
launched in 2009, still

1113
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:24,230
operating.

1114
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,750
I think it's the longest
operating, continuously

1115
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:28,849
operating CubeSat so far.

1116
00:55:28,849 --> 00:55:32,059
There's like over six years
of operational data now.

1117
00:55:32,059 --> 00:55:34,519
And so you know, for the
next generation, which

1118
00:55:34,519 --> 00:55:39,820
is shown here, how would you do
a Cubesat in such a facility?

1119
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:40,819
And there's three steps.

1120
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,890
You define your
decomposition level.

1121
00:55:42,889 --> 00:55:45,839
So you have your system
level, your subsystem level,

1122
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,410
and then at the lowest
level it's called equipment.

1123
00:55:48,409 --> 00:55:50,960
These are the actual components.

1124
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,659
And you have your product
decomposition here,

1125
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:55,730
and then for each
of these components,

1126
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:58,670
you have different sheets
that give you either component

1127
00:55:58,670 --> 00:56:04,220
choices or give you different
parameters like mass power

1128
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:06,679
with margins that allow
you to then choose

1129
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:11,489
from this like a menu and pull
together your overall design.

1130
00:56:11,489 --> 00:56:13,456
So that's a Cubesat example.

1131
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:15,039
But I want to talk
to you a little bit

1132
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,250
in more detail through a design
of a suborbital space plane

1133
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,849
that was done in
that CDF, and this

1134
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:26,360
was a project known as K1000.

1135
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,240
So some of you may have heard
of the Hermes, the Hermes space

1136
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:31,099
plane.

1137
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,239
This was a project that the
European Space Agency had

1138
00:56:35,239 --> 00:56:39,649
starting even in the
'80s, and it wasn't built,

1139
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:41,780
but there was a lot
of studies done.

1140
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,310
And this is essentially
a Hermes-like vehicle

1141
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:48,059
but for space tourism,
that's the basic application.

1142
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:51,799
And so you know, how would
you design a space tourism

1143
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,690
vehicle in a CDF?

1144
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,150
Well, you have to start
with requirements, right?

1145
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,581
Without requirements, you're
just-- it's like, you know,

1146
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:00,079
setting--

1147
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,420
my analogy for designing
without requirements

1148
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,800
is like taking your ship and
going out to sea without a map,

1149
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,310
without a chart, with no
destination port in mind.

1150
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:12,989
You're just drifting
in the ocean.

1151
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:14,809
You've got to have requirements.

1152
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:17,150
So here are the high
level requirements

1153
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,980
for this particular vehicle.

1154
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,539
Level one
requirements-- you have

1155
00:57:20,539 --> 00:57:25,279
to reach an altitude of at least
100 kilometers over sea level.

1156
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,930
Why is that?

1157
00:57:26,929 --> 00:57:29,269
Where does the 100
kilometers come from?

1158
00:57:29,269 --> 00:57:34,000
Why is it not 80 or 90 or 150?

1159
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,050
AUDIENCE: That's where
space is defined.

1160
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,600
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
and what happens to people

1161
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:41,031
who go above 100 kilometers?

1162
00:57:41,032 --> 00:57:42,740
AUDIENCE: They get
their astronaut wings.

1163
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:45,049
OLIVIER DE WECK:
They get their--

1164
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,450
you have gone to
space, and like,

1165
00:57:47,449 --> 00:57:49,489
you know, you can
claim that you've gone

1166
00:57:49,489 --> 00:57:52,609
to space if you go above 100.

1167
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:54,769
If you don't, if you are
at 80 or 90 you don't.

1168
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:57,079
That's kind of
internationally accepted.

1169
00:57:57,079 --> 00:58:01,579
So that's really where that
requirement comes from.

1170
00:58:01,579 --> 00:58:04,639
The second one is
a zero g phase.

1171
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:06,920
You should experience
weightlessness

1172
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,480
for at least several minutes.

1173
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,429
Who's done a parabolic
flight before here?

1174
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:15,099
The zero g, you know,
the Vomit Comet?

1175
00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:16,679
Anybody?

1176
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:19,099
Wow, we have to get
you guys out there.

1177
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,630
At EPFL, are you still with us?

1178
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,920


1179
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,230
AUDIENCE: We are.

1180
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,690
OLIVIER DE WECK: Has anybody
done parabolic flights?

1181
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:32,960
I know there's a flight campaign
coming up in Switzerland

1182
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,579
later this year?

1183
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:36,779
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it will
be next year, I guess,

1184
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:39,710
but unfortunately, no one
has done this right now here.

1185
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,960
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right,
guys, we have to fix this.

1186
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,070
This is unacceptable.

1187
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,500
I mean, we have to work on this.

1188
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,059
So it's very cool to do
these parabolic flights,

1189
00:58:50,059 --> 00:58:52,549
but you only get about
20 seconds, right?

1190
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,590
20 seconds at the top.

1191
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,559
It's like riding a big
roller coaster, basically.

1192
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,320
And then you go down, and
then you suffer, you know,

1193
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,880
1.7 g's or whatever.

1194
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,220
Then you come back up.

1195
00:59:04,219 --> 00:59:05,539
But we want several minutes.

1196
00:59:05,539 --> 00:59:08,719


1197
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:12,159
And then the next requirement
is that the passengers

1198
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:15,710
should carry-- there should
be six passengers carried

1199
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:16,940
on this vehicle.

1200
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:19,519
Those are the top
level one requirements.

1201
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,269
Lower level-- level two
requirements-- safety.

1202
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:28,039
Don't exceed six g,
positive six g's.

1203
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:31,139
The vehicle must be
controllable at all times.

1204
00:59:31,139 --> 00:59:33,179
So when you're out
of the atmosphere,

1205
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:35,179
you have to be able to
control the vehicle, that

1206
00:59:35,179 --> 00:59:37,489
has certain implications.

1207
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:39,139
The customer
experience-- you should

1208
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:42,549
be able to see the Earth's
curvature and atmosphere,

1209
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:46,010
that thin layer, at all times.

1210
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,680
The spacecraft impact
on the environment

1211
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:50,539
should be as small as possible.

1212
00:59:50,539 --> 00:59:53,210
And then the mass budget,
the spacecraft mass

1213
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:57,050
should not exceed 11.6
tons with propellants.

1214
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,060
Where do you think
that comes from?

1215
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:01,250
What kind of a
requirement is that?

1216
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:02,969
What flavor of
requirement is that?

1217
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:03,469
Yeah?

1218
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,553
AUDIENCE: Transporting it
for proper [INAUDIBLE]..

1219
01:00:05,554 --> 01:00:07,220
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Right, so in this case,

1220
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:09,099
it's actually a
piggyback, right?

1221
01:00:09,099 --> 01:00:11,889
You either have
a vertical launch

1222
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:15,269
or you have a first stage,
an airplane from which you

1223
01:00:15,269 --> 01:00:16,179
are dropped right?

1224
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:18,980
So that's sort of an
interface requirement.

1225
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:21,400
OK, so once you know
your requirements,

1226
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,950
you can really start
developing your models.

1227
01:00:23,949 --> 01:00:31,879
So here's a model of essentially
the kinematics of the vehicle.

1228
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,090
So you have your environment,
your atmospheric model,

1229
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,850
atmospheric density, pressure,
mach number, speed of sound,

1230
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:41,529
a gravity model.

1231
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,580
Then computing the forces and
torques acting on the vehicle

1232
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:50,170
itself, looking at the
derivatives, integrating that.

1233
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:51,730
This is essentially
the equations

1234
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,909
of motion of a vehicle
in its environment

1235
01:00:54,909 --> 01:00:57,159
that it's operating
in, and then updating

1236
01:00:57,159 --> 01:01:01,059
that with a certain
time step, delta T.

1237
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:03,250
So you can zoom in
on one of these,

1238
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:08,400
for example, this force model,
computation of the forces.

1239
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:09,760
And there's two frames.

1240
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,170
There's the Earth
reference frame

1241
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,909
and, then there's the
body centric frame

1242
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:14,679
of the vehicle itself.

1243
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:19,329
So you have, in this case,
the aerodynamic coefficients.

1244
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:22,690
You have the forces, lift,
drag, pitching moment,

1245
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:25,269
and then you have the actuation.

1246
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:28,539
This is assumed, you know, the
pilots are here in control.

1247
01:01:28,539 --> 01:01:31,690
The rocket engine itself,
secondary propulsion,

1248
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:34,809
the rudders, and then
attitude thrusters.

1249
01:01:34,809 --> 01:01:37,674
You need those especially--

1250
01:01:37,675 --> 01:01:40,480
you know, once you're out of
the atmosphere, the rudders--

1251
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,750
the aerodynamic surfaces
are no longer effective.

1252
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,550
And we knew this in the '60s.

1253
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:48,670
Vehicles-- like the
X15 is very famous.

1254
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,500
Well, it had thrusters
that you could

1255
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,619
you could actuate once
you're out of the atmosphere.

1256
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:56,619
So you know, you can go
pretty detailed in this.

1257
01:01:56,619 --> 01:01:59,199


1258
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,919
You would then design the
vehicle in a particular way,

1259
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:08,559
you know, particular engine,
wing dimensions, aspect ratio,

1260
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,920
a particular flight
profile, and then

1261
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,130
that would be a typical result
that you would get in a CDF.

1262
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,990
There's two curves shown here.

1263
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:21,049
The blue curve is essentially
altitude and kilometers.

1264
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,320
So you see there's
the 100 kilometers.

1265
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,760
We need to get
above this, right?

1266
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,540
This was our requirement.

1267
01:02:26,539 --> 01:02:27,820
So we go above 100.

1268
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,390
That's good.

1269
01:02:28,389 --> 01:02:29,750
We satisfy that requirement.

1270
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:32,559
So looks like a
parabola, and then we

1271
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:35,860
have a-- we glide here,
essentially, to the ground.

1272
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:40,809
The whole mission takes about
900 seconds, 15 minutes.

1273
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:44,799
And then the yellow curve here
is your load factor, your NZ,

1274
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,030
your vertical load factor.

1275
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:50,500
And you can see that's a
little noisier as a curve.

1276
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:55,989
So we have higher acceleration
as we accelerate to altitude.

1277
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:59,649
And you can see that
roughly here, roughly

1278
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:04,769
in the middle of the parabola,
the load factor starts to--

1279
01:03:04,769 --> 01:03:06,159
you're basically in free fall.

1280
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:10,839
You're basically ballistic,
and the peak acceleration

1281
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:16,210
is about 4.3 g's here, so
we satisfy that requirement.

1282
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:20,050
And the whole reason we're doing
it is for this period here,

1283
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:22,360
that zero g experience.

1284
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,410
So when the load factor
goes to zero, or near zero,

1285
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:28,129
that's when you
get weightlessness.

1286
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:31,240
And it turns out for this
particular flight profile,

1287
01:03:31,239 --> 01:03:36,909
we would experience 184
seconds, about three minutes

1288
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:40,379
of weightlessness.

1289
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,110
This is pretty similar
to the flight profile

1290
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:47,440
that Virgin Galactic is
pursuing, by the way.

1291
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:54,099
So you know, looking at
this result, you would say,

1292
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:57,480
well, I don't know about
the mass here, but from,

1293
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,750
you know, reaching
100 kilometers keeping

1294
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:07,179
accelerations below six g, this
looks like a feasible profile.

1295
01:04:07,179 --> 01:04:10,089
Of course, the other
thing that we care about

1296
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,600
is the view, since this
is for space tourism.

1297
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:17,920
We want to make
sure that, you know,

1298
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,590
that the experience
is great, not just

1299
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:23,230
from an experiencing
weightlessness, which

1300
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:26,949
you can do in a closed can but
you actually see something.

1301
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:31,480
So this was essentially
coupled with a virtual reality

1302
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,980
visualization.

1303
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,170
So you can see, you
know, the landing here.

1304
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:38,200


1305
01:04:38,199 --> 01:04:40,000
You can see these
three views here.

1306
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,429
And you can see
the vehicle itself.

1307
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:44,710
So the pilots are up
front, and then here

1308
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:46,659
is our six passengers.

1309
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:51,033
Every one of the passengers
gets their own window.

1310
01:04:51,034 --> 01:04:52,450
So this is the
view that you would

1311
01:04:52,449 --> 01:04:55,909
get from the front window.

1312
01:04:55,909 --> 01:04:58,149
This is the view from
the middle window.

1313
01:04:58,150 --> 01:05:00,970
And then this is the view
from the back window,

1314
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:04,029
from that last window here,
which is closer to the back,

1315
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:05,570
to the engines.

1316
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:09,330
So what would you, looking
at these pictures-- you know,

1317
01:05:09,329 --> 01:05:13,739
this comes directly out of
the simulation and the CDF--

1318
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:15,629
what would you say
looking at this?

1319
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,190


1320
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,240
Anything you notice?

1321
01:05:19,239 --> 01:05:21,579
EPFL anything you guys notice?

1322
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:24,460
Look at the view from
the front, the middle,

1323
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,570
and the back window.

1324
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:28,755


1325
01:05:28,755 --> 01:05:30,380
AUDIENCE: From the
front, looks better.

1326
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,650
I guess it will be
more expensive, again,

1327
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,360
for the customer.

1328
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,920
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so that's
exactly what I was asking.

1329
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,789
So it looks like either you
need to redesign the vehicle so

1330
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:46,329
that the view is the same, more
or less, from every window,

1331
01:05:46,329 --> 01:05:49,449
or you need to start
charging differential prices.

1332
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:54,309
Because clearly,
from the back window,

1333
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:59,166
half your view is obstructed
by the wing structure, right?

1334
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,250
Would you agree with that?

1335
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,610


1336
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,430
Would you charge different
ticket prices for this ride,

1337
01:06:06,429 --> 01:06:08,169
depending on which seat you get?

1338
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:11,769


1339
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:14,110
AUDIENCE: I guess
that's offer and demand?

1340
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,030
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Supply and demand, yes.

1341
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,260
That's right.

1342
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:18,150
Go ahead.

1343
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:22,240
AUDIENCE: It could also merit
a change in flight plan.

1344
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,819
If your structure blocks
the downward view,

1345
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,160
you might want to
consider flipping over

1346
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:31,029
if like the Earth is what
you're trying to see from above.

1347
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:34,390
So it may have broader
implications for the mission.

1348
01:06:34,389 --> 01:06:37,150
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
so the point here,

1349
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:41,829
is there a way to operationally
improve the experience,

1350
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:43,670
keeping the vehicle
design the same?

1351
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,670
Absolutely, but
what that means is,

1352
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,650
you would have to
put the operation--

1353
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,440
so the orientation
of the vehicle,

1354
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,619
you'd have to put that
into your design vector

1355
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:55,609
if you want to change it.

1356
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,309
OK, so I don't know.

1357
01:06:57,309 --> 01:06:59,000
I think this is pretty cool.

1358
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,610
So you can actually do a lot in
this kind of CDF type setting.

1359
01:07:03,610 --> 01:07:08,620
And by the way, of the things
that spun out of this project

1360
01:07:08,619 --> 01:07:11,859
is this company called S3.

1361
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:15,070
Their headquarters in
Payerne in Switzerland.

1362
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:17,350
This is actually-- I did a
lot of my military service

1363
01:07:17,349 --> 01:07:18,730
at that airport.

1364
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:20,679
Their goal is not
space tourism, you

1365
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:22,629
see there's no windows
on this vehicle,

1366
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:25,720
but deployment of small
satellites, custom

1367
01:07:25,719 --> 01:07:29,279
deployment for small satellites
with a reusable vehicle.

1368
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,900
So you know, I think it's
a very interesting concept,

1369
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,329
but the question is,
is it feasible, right?

1370
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:42,279
Is it feasible-- the
aerodynamics, the economics,

1371
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,100
structurally, engine reuse?

1372
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:45,029
There's a lot of--

1373
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:48,100
this is a great
picture, but you know,

1374
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:49,489
the devil is in the details.

1375
01:07:49,489 --> 01:07:53,229
So really working out the
details of such a design,

1376
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:58,719
that's what a CDF is for,
and you can really go deep.

1377
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:01,259
OK so any questions about this?

1378
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:05,380
I'd like to do a little
partner exercise here.

1379
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,700
Any questions?

1380
01:08:06,699 --> 01:08:12,909
So let's do a partner
exercise, and the question is,

1381
01:08:12,909 --> 01:08:16,090
what are your experiences with
concurrent design facilities

1382
01:08:16,090 --> 01:08:17,750
so far?

1383
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,279
Whether you've done an
internship at ESA or JPL,

1384
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,729
or some other place that
has a facility like this,

1385
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:28,840
or even if you
haven't been there,

1386
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:32,560
kind of speculate and discuss
what it would be like.

1387
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,920
Maybe, you know, what would
be your favorite chair?

1388
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,609
Would you pick propulsion or
costing or flight trajectory?

1389
01:08:42,609 --> 01:08:46,250
You know, just sort of speculate
and discuss with your partner,

1390
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:49,210
so for which project or
application did you use it?

1391
01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:49,960
What went well?

1392
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,010
What did not?

1393
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:52,119
What could be improved?

1394
01:08:52,119 --> 01:08:54,699
And again, if you don't
have much experiences,

1395
01:08:54,699 --> 01:08:57,798
just think ahead what
it would be like.

1396
01:08:57,798 --> 01:08:59,590
What would you like to
get out of it if you

1397
01:08:59,590 --> 01:09:02,460
have no experience in it?

1398
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,100
AUDIENCE: So there is at ESA,
a concurrent design facility,

1399
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:12,250
and I was talking with Katya
that maybe also United Nations

1400
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:16,250
can be considered, like,
the facilities there

1401
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:20,119
can be considered a
concurrent design facility.

1402
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:22,510
I don't know if it
worked, this approach.

1403
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:24,489
OLIVIER DE WECK: Do
you mean in Geneva,

1404
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:28,065
United Nations in Geneva
or London or New York,

1405
01:09:28,065 --> 01:09:29,148
or do you mean in general?

1406
01:09:29,149 --> 01:09:29,950
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

1407
01:09:29,949 --> 01:09:31,568
OLIVIER DE WECK:
But do they actually

1408
01:09:31,569 --> 01:09:35,859
have a physical facility
with models and screens,

1409
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:39,590
or are you saying this
more metaphorically?

1410
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:40,840
AUDIENCE: Metaphorically more.

1411
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,130
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, but you know I--

1412
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:43,998
go ahead.

1413
01:09:43,998 --> 01:09:44,630
Go ahead.

1414
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we're referring
to the layout, to the site,

1415
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,869
we're looking at the
ESA layout, where

1416
01:09:49,869 --> 01:09:52,664
you have one big room, where
you have all the people coming

1417
01:09:52,664 --> 01:09:54,789
together, all the different
models coming together.

1418
01:09:54,789 --> 01:09:56,050
So that's like all
the different experts.

1419
01:09:56,050 --> 01:09:58,529
Then you have subrooms for
different project rooms,

1420
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,679
and then you have, like,
a big conference room.

1421
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:05,470
That's kind of the structure of
the layout of the facilities.

1422
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:08,320
OLIVIER DE WECK: But you know,
maybe a place like the UN

1423
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:12,429
could really benefit when they
deal with a refugee crisis

1424
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:15,850
or with, you know, climate
change negotiations.

1425
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:17,410
I like this idea.

1426
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:18,609
Great suggestion.

1427
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:19,960
What about here at MIT?

1428
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,369
Any experiences, thoughts?

1429
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:22,729
Yeah, please go ahead.

1430
01:10:22,729 --> 01:10:26,729
AUDIENCE: Yeah, AFRL, we have
a rapid innovation officer.

1431
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:30,879
He's like a general equivalent
as a civilian, a LOC BOS,

1432
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:36,069
and he basically is tasked with
breaking all the rules in AFRL.

1433
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:39,460
Whereas most projects
take years to complete,

1434
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:42,880
he fields questions from
the field, from the theater,

1435
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,010
from war fighters, and
they have an urgent need.

1436
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:49,550
And he gets them a solution
in under 12 months.

1437
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:54,610
So he pulls in all these
experts from industry, academia,

1438
01:10:54,609 --> 01:10:55,750
wherever.

1439
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:58,149
He'll lock them in
a room, and they

1440
01:10:58,149 --> 01:11:00,369
don't leave until they
come up with a solution.

1441
01:11:00,369 --> 01:11:03,460
And he has the money
and the influence,

1442
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,698
the backing by the AFRL
Commander to get it done.

1443
01:11:05,698 --> 01:11:07,239
OLIVIER DE WECK:
And what does that--

1444
01:11:07,239 --> 01:11:09,039
I mean, if you
can share, roughly

1445
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,470
what does that facility
look like roughly?

1446
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:15,520
Does it have, like, models
and computers and screens?

1447
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,050
AUDIENCE: Just white walls,
like, whiteboard walls,

1448
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:22,112
and they will just be covered
with everybody's ideas

1449
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,319
by the time they leave there.

1450
01:11:23,319 --> 01:11:24,444
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, I see.

1451
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:27,170
So it's not as much
computationally supported.

1452
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:28,404
It's more of a human process.

1453
01:11:28,404 --> 01:11:29,219
AUDIENCE: That's right.

1454
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,860
OLIVIER DE WECK: Cool.

1455
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:30,309
OK.

1456
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:30,810
Great.

1457
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:34,150
Interesting.

1458
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:35,979
Any other experiences?

1459
01:11:35,979 --> 01:11:39,250
Anybody been at JPL or
seen a commercial facility

1460
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,340
in a commercial company
that does this kind of work?

1461
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:43,782
Please, go ahead, Justice.

1462
01:11:43,782 --> 01:11:46,489


1463
01:11:46,489 --> 01:11:48,327
AUDIENCE: Well it's
less of a commercial--

1464
01:11:48,327 --> 01:11:50,909
I was interning at the Aerospace
Corporation this past summer,

1465
01:11:50,909 --> 01:11:53,239
and I was working in their
concurrent design center.

1466
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:58,969
And it uses a similar layout
as JPL's Team X's design, where

1467
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:01,010
it's basically using models.

1468
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:04,204
That they have, like, a group
of engineers who sit at desks,

1469
01:12:04,204 --> 01:12:06,079
and there's multiple
engineers per subsystem,

1470
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:07,430
and they just discuss.

1471
01:12:07,430 --> 01:12:09,619
They're given a
mission objective,

1472
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:12,989
and they discuss how they can
best design the system based

1473
01:12:12,989 --> 01:12:13,489
on that.

1474
01:12:13,489 --> 01:12:15,869
And they model it and
optimize it in the subsystem,

1475
01:12:15,869 --> 01:12:18,635
and then they feed it back
to a systems level design.

1476
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:20,510
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did
you participate in that?

1477
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1478
01:12:21,229 --> 01:12:24,409
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what
did you think of it?

1479
01:12:24,409 --> 01:12:26,000
AUDIENCE: A lot--
it's a lot to take

1480
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,100
in at first just
trying to understand

1481
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,480
how each of the models work.

1482
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:33,279
You're not necessarily
supposed to work on each model,

1483
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,329
but as an intern, they
wanted me to kind of see

1484
01:12:35,329 --> 01:12:39,601
what each of the models would
do and not necessarily exactly

1485
01:12:39,601 --> 01:12:41,809
how the optimization techniques
work because I didn't

1486
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,030
necessarily understand
it, but just more

1487
01:12:44,029 --> 01:12:47,960
of have an idea of how it
actually works as a whole.

1488
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,489
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

1489
01:12:49,489 --> 01:12:54,139
Anybody else at EPFL want
to share any experiences?

1490
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,410


1491
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:01,960
AUDIENCE: Apparently not, but
just a problem with the sound.

1492
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,640
We didn't hear anything on what
the guy before just told us.

1493
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, Justice,
did you push the mic button?

1494
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,260
OK, yeah, so
basically, he worked--

1495
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:12,760
let me try to summarize.

1496
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,710
He worked at the
Aerospace Corporation.

1497
01:13:14,710 --> 01:13:16,899
He interned at the
Airspace Corporation.

1498
01:13:16,899 --> 01:13:19,239
Was it in Virginia
or California?

1499
01:13:19,239 --> 01:13:21,279
California, in California.

1500
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,579
And Aerospace Corporation
is like a think tank,

1501
01:13:24,579 --> 01:13:28,899
and it was a very similar set
up with different subsystem

1502
01:13:28,899 --> 01:13:30,909
experts, different models.

1503
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:33,670
And Justice was saying
one of the big challenges

1504
01:13:33,670 --> 01:13:36,609
is so much information,
taking it all in

1505
01:13:36,609 --> 01:13:40,279
and understanding all the models
and coupling, and so forth.

1506
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:41,859
So and I agree.

1507
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:42,699
It takes a while.

1508
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:44,769
If you haven't been working
in this environment,

1509
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:47,540
it takes a while to
really get used to it.

1510
01:13:47,539 --> 01:13:52,180
So the last thing I'll
say here is that--

1511
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,090
well, two things.

1512
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,390
One is-- and they're
linked-- one is

1513
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:59,230
that these CDFs are not cheap.

1514
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:02,379
If you really want a
high-functioning CDF,

1515
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,260
you have to have people
that are dedicated to this.

1516
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:08,230
You know, the software
licenses expire.

1517
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:10,419
The technology gets old.

1518
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,250
You need to not
just use it, but you

1519
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,479
need to constantly refresh
a CDF, keep it up to date,

1520
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:19,250
and it just doesn't
happen automatically.

1521
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:21,760
You've got to have
budget for that.

1522
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,310
You have to have people who
are dedicated to updating

1523
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,280
the models, updating the
facility, and so forth.

1524
01:14:28,279 --> 01:14:31,119
So it's definitely
something that

1525
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:34,899
needs to be invested
in on a regular basis.

1526
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:39,309
So what happened to us
here at MIT in air astro,

1527
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:41,650
actually, when I
was sitting where

1528
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:44,170
you are sitting
as a grad student,

1529
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:47,319
we created a CDF
in the mid '90s.

1530
01:14:47,319 --> 01:14:50,769
And you know, it was
just like the one at JPL.

1531
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:55,840
We had desktops, you know, with
labels-- thermal, propulsion.

1532
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,869
And we used it quite
actively for maybe five, six,

1533
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:04,029
seven years, but we didn't put
the budget into it every year.

1534
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:06,609
We didn't have a dedicated
person who was really.

1535
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:07,839
looking after it.

1536
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:13,239
So what happened to our CDF
is that entropy took over,

1537
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:15,489
and it sort of got
more and more dated.

1538
01:15:15,489 --> 01:15:17,529
And when you go and
look in this room now,

1539
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:20,329
it kind of looks like a
regular conference room.

1540
01:15:20,329 --> 01:15:22,809
So all the desktops
that we had are gone.

1541
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:25,180
I guess they'd be
pretty old by now.

1542
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:31,360
And there has been a pretty
strong debate among the faculty

1543
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:32,960
whether actually we need this.

1544
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,689
Should we recreate one?

1545
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:36,879
And the argument
goes as follows,

1546
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,010
the proponents say that a CDF
is really something special.

1547
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,510
When you enter in the CDF, you
know this is a special place.

1548
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:49,960
This is a facility that's
designed specifically

1549
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:52,630
for doing rapid studies.

1550
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:55,000
All the information
you need is there.

1551
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,630
The walls are plastered
with reference information.

1552
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:02,170
You know, really,
that's what it's for.

1553
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:08,029
The counter argument is that
this is no longer the mid-'90s.

1554
01:16:08,029 --> 01:16:11,019
Now, everybody has laptops.

1555
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:13,330
Everybody does mobile computing.

1556
01:16:13,329 --> 01:16:16,840
All the models and data
should be on the cloud,

1557
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,170
not sitting anymore in a
dedicated server facility,

1558
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,579
but it's sitting on the cloud.

1559
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:24,760
And therefore, you
know, physically,

1560
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,820
a facility that's dedicated
is no longer needed.

1561
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:30,670
What you do is you
get together in a more

1562
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:33,279
kind of flexible ad hoc way.

1563
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:35,079
Everybody brings their laptops.

1564
01:16:35,079 --> 01:16:37,600
You have the big white
walls, like you said.

1565
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,740
And you can just create
a CDF on the fly, right?

1566
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:43,899
Everybody brings their
computing resources.

1567
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:47,199
Stuff is on the cloud.

1568
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,380
And then you get a lot done,
and then you disband again.

1569
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:53,020
You clean the white
boards and you're done.

1570
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,740
Therefore, no longer
needed a dedicated CDF.

1571
01:16:56,739 --> 01:17:04,409
Those are the two countervailing
opinions right now.

1572
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:09,569
My view is, I think a CDF
still has value today.

1573
01:17:09,569 --> 01:17:14,649
I think it is valuable
as a dedicated facility,

1574
01:17:14,649 --> 01:17:16,029
but it needs to be updated.

1575
01:17:16,029 --> 01:17:18,569
So yes, the models
should be on the cloud.

1576
01:17:18,569 --> 01:17:20,759
Yes, you can bring your
laptops, but it is still

1577
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,940
valuable to have dedicated
computing resources, again.

1578
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:30,250
So I now think a hybrid model
is actually the right way to go.

1579
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:33,939
So we'll see where it goes, but
it's a pretty active debate.

1580
01:17:33,939 --> 01:17:35,819
There have also been,
you know, theses

1581
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:39,880
written on CDFs, comparing
different CDFs and so forth.

1582
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:45,840
So take a look at the Anton
Ivanov paper in the reading

1583
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,730
and just think about this.

1584
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:51,209
I think this is a
big deal, and it's

1585
01:17:51,210 --> 01:17:53,909
going to be even more important
than the future, whether you're

1586
01:17:53,909 --> 01:17:57,389
doing space missions,
aeronautics,

1587
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,550
whether you're designing
commercial products,

1588
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,420
you know, or in the
military, these facilities

1589
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:06,029
that allow you to make these
design decisions in a very

1590
01:18:06,029 --> 01:18:09,420
interactive, very
quick way are gonna

1591
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,130
be more and more
important in the future,

1592
01:18:11,130 --> 01:18:15,204
and this is a big part
of system engineering.

1593
01:18:15,204 --> 01:18:19,699
Any final thoughts on
this before we move on?

1594
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:26,399
OK, so here some lessons
learned from the EPFL CDF.

1595
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:29,969
So this is particularly in
the university environment,

1596
01:18:29,970 --> 01:18:33,960
so you know, giving access
to a wide body of students.

1597
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,810
You need to adapt this to
the university's schedule,

1598
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:43,410
the learning curves, the analogy
of a smoke-filled room or war

1599
01:18:43,409 --> 01:18:46,079
room, optimal team size.

1600
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:49,680
You know a CDF with 50 people
on it is not as effective as one

1601
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:52,800
with, you know, seven
plus or minus two.

1602
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,659
And then distributed CDFs--

1603
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,859
they don't typically
work as well.

1604
01:18:56,859 --> 01:19:00,779
So I almost wore my--

1605
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,719
I have a shirt that's
almost the same.

1606
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:07,390
Anybody know who this is
or where this is from?

1607
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:10,090
This is Sheldon Cooper
in the Big Bang Theory,

1608
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,310
his virtual reality presence.

1609
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:18,100
So the point here is that
virtual reality is OK.

1610
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:23,380
So you can imagine a CDF where
half the people are in the room

1611
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,289
and half the people are
dialing in remotely,

1612
01:19:26,289 --> 01:19:30,720
but it's never quite as good as
everybody is there physically.

1613
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:34,140
So human interaction
is critical.

1614
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:39,380
OK, the last thing I want to
talk about today is the CDR.

1615
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,239
This is a big, big milestone.

1616
01:19:41,239 --> 01:19:42,859
This is a very big deal.

1617
01:19:42,859 --> 01:19:46,519
The critical design review,
the main purpose of it

1618
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,720
is to approve the final
design in all its glory,

1619
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,530
in all its details.

1620
01:19:52,529 --> 01:19:56,239
So generally, the
way we talk about it

1621
01:19:56,239 --> 01:20:00,469
is, if you pass the CDR, you've
got the green light to quote,

1622
01:20:00,470 --> 01:20:02,210
end quote, cut metal.

1623
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:06,750
Of course, you know, our systems
have software and hardware.

1624
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:10,520
So the cut metal is
essentially a euphemism

1625
01:20:10,520 --> 01:20:14,420
for you can go ahead and
manufacture the system now.

1626
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,449
CDRs are typically
the biggest review.

1627
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:22,399
The largest number of people
you will have at the CDR.

1628
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:26,259
You know, if you had
10 people at the SRR

1629
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:28,850
and 20 people at the
PDR, you're gonna

1630
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:31,789
have 50 or 100
people at the CDR.

1631
01:20:31,789 --> 01:20:35,479
Because any question that
comes up on any of the parts--

1632
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:37,459
say, is this really right?

1633
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:40,489
Well, what could be the
impact of this detail

1634
01:20:40,489 --> 01:20:41,989
on the rest of the systems?

1635
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:45,069
Somebody should be there
who designed that part

1636
01:20:45,069 --> 01:20:48,289
or who can answer the
question at least.

1637
01:20:48,289 --> 01:20:51,619
And CDRs are typically
longer than one day.

1638
01:20:51,619 --> 01:20:53,809
In fact, for a
big project, a CDR

1639
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:56,300
can be a whole week of reviews.

1640
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,850
So people get really tired.

1641
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:01,880
Big CDRs are very,
very detailed.

1642
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:05,659
You really have to drink lots
of coffee and stay awake.

1643
01:21:05,659 --> 01:21:09,139
So here's the description
of what a CDR is.

1644
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:13,670
One of the guidelines is
that approximately 90%

1645
01:21:13,670 --> 01:21:16,640
of the engineering drawings
are approved and released.

1646
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:21,860
So it's OK to have a CDR if
you have not 100% of everything

1647
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:25,880
done, but you need to have
at least 90% complete.

1648
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,869
You can't do a CDR, with, you
know, half the drawings done.

1649
01:21:29,869 --> 01:21:34,069
And it happens at the end
of phase C, the final design

1650
01:21:34,069 --> 01:21:35,840
phase C.

1651
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:41,449
For very large projects,
you can have sub CDRs.

1652
01:21:41,449 --> 01:21:44,449
You'll have a system
level CDR, and then you

1653
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:47,809
can have sub CDRs for
every major subsystem

1654
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:49,760
in your project.

1655
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,100
So an example, I
put a link here.

1656
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:58,640
This is from late 2014, the
CDR for the James Webb Space

1657
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:00,710
Telescope that I
mentioned earlier.

1658
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:03,439
They passed the last
major element level

1659
01:22:03,439 --> 01:22:08,219
critical design review,
which was a big deal.

1660
01:22:08,220 --> 01:22:11,090
So launch is planned for 2018.

1661
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:14,420
But for big projects,
what I'm trying to say is,

1662
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,350
there may be more
than one CDR. There

1663
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,520
may be the master CDR
for the whole thing

1664
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,670
and then sub CDRs for
different subsystems.

1665
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:25,859
Now, if you don't-- well, let me
get to this on the next chart.

1666
01:22:25,859 --> 01:22:27,449
Yeah, go ahead.

1667
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:30,899
AUDIENCE: Are the, like, CDR
slides for NASA projects,

1668
01:22:30,899 --> 01:22:34,949
are those available
anywhere as a public entity

1669
01:22:34,949 --> 01:22:38,198
and can you get access
to any of that stuff?

1670
01:22:38,198 --> 01:22:39,364
OLIVIER DE WECK: It depends.

1671
01:22:39,364 --> 01:22:42,869


1672
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:46,439
Not always, because especially
if commercial companies,

1673
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:50,549
like, you know, Lockheed-Martin
or somebody is doing, like,

1674
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:53,550
the spacecraft bus, they
would consider those details

1675
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,329
proprietary.

1676
01:22:55,329 --> 01:22:58,769
So in general, I would say no.

1677
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:04,080
But for CanSat, actually, you've
probably already found them.

1678
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:07,079
For CanSat, you can
actually find a lot of this.

1679
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:10,869
So prior PDRs and
CDRs, you can see that.

1680
01:23:10,869 --> 01:23:12,819
I encourage you not
to look too much.

1681
01:23:12,819 --> 01:23:15,235
You know, you kind of want to
come up with your own thing.

1682
01:23:15,235 --> 01:23:18,029
But you know, for
projects that don't

1683
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:21,090
have a commercial interest
or proprietary technology,

1684
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:23,610
it's often available.

1685
01:23:23,609 --> 01:23:28,609
So to show you just-- this is
a table from the Handbook, page

1686
01:23:28,609 --> 01:23:30,710
178.

1687
01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:35,480
This is the entrance criteria
and the exit criteria for CDR.

1688
01:23:35,479 --> 01:23:39,559
So entrance criteria means what
do you have to have in order

1689
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:43,610
to be allowed to go
forward with a CDR?

1690
01:23:43,609 --> 01:23:45,380
And it's mainly three things--

1691
01:23:45,380 --> 01:23:49,100
successful completion of
the PDR, and responses

1692
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:52,550
made to all the
PDR RFAs and RIDs.

1693
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:56,960
RFAs and RIDs are essentially
deficiencies, open items

1694
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:58,250
that came up in the PDR.

1695
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,170
So you have to close them out.

1696
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:02,569
A CDR agenda, and
then number three

1697
01:24:02,569 --> 01:24:05,449
is all the technical
work packages.

1698
01:24:05,449 --> 01:24:07,970
And so you see, it's
a huge list here--

1699
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:11,010
baseline documents,
specification, fabrication,

1700
01:24:11,010 --> 01:24:14,449
assembly and integration,
technical data package,

1701
01:24:14,449 --> 01:24:18,019
acceptance criteria,
verification and validation

1702
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,740
plan, launch site selection,
and operations plan--

1703
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:24,139
super, super, super detailed.

1704
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:26,240
This is a lot of information.

1705
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:30,319
And at the CDR, you're
gonna go through all this.

1706
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:34,649
So you can imagine
what that means.

1707
01:24:34,649 --> 01:24:36,889
And then success
criteria, on the right,

1708
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:42,380
is, you know, in order to
successfully pass the CDR,

1709
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:47,270
these are all the things that
you have to basically have.

1710
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:49,970
You have to have approval
for all these things.

1711
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:54,740
Now in reality, just
like a PDR, at a CDR,

1712
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:56,479
things will come
up that you missed

1713
01:24:56,479 --> 01:24:58,639
or that people have
concerns about.

1714
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,270
And so you will make
a list of those,

1715
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:04,790
and then you have to address
these action items coming out

1716
01:25:04,789 --> 01:25:08,569
of a CDR. If those action
items are serious--

1717
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:13,250
if they're really serious, you
could fail the CDR and say,

1718
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:15,199
you know, this is
not gonna work.

1719
01:25:15,199 --> 01:25:17,869


1720
01:25:17,869 --> 01:25:19,609
We should not proceed.

1721
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:20,719
And they send you back.

1722
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,490
Or they cancel the project.

1723
01:25:22,489 --> 01:25:24,619
That's happened also.

1724
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:28,369
More likely, is that they'll
ask you to do a so-called delta

1725
01:25:28,369 --> 01:25:31,250
CDR. So they'll
have you, you know,

1726
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:33,289
it's like retaking
an exam or something.

1727
01:25:33,289 --> 01:25:35,840
They'll have you
come back, and you'll

1728
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:41,150
have to do a CDR again but
only on the delta, the portion

1729
01:25:41,149 --> 01:25:43,729
that raised concerns
at the main CDR.

1730
01:25:43,729 --> 01:25:45,799
You don't have to
do everything again.

1731
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:47,570
That's called a delta CDR.

1732
01:25:47,569 --> 01:25:50,989
OK, any questions about CDR?

1733
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:53,399
This is really the--
this is the big one.

1734
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:54,979
This is the big milestone.

1735
01:25:54,979 --> 01:25:58,489
And obviously, you know, the
concept or the architecture

1736
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:02,639
you chose at the PDR turns
out not to be a good one,

1737
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:06,800
it's very difficult to make
changes to that here, right?

1738
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,039
You're kind of locked in to
whatever design or architecture

1739
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,180
you chose at PDR.

1740
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,003
That's why PDR is also
so important, even

1741
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,170
though you have less detail.

1742
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,070
Yeah, Sam, go ahead.

1743
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:19,069
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
have contracts in place

1744
01:26:19,069 --> 01:26:22,266
already for the, like,
manufacturing and operations?

1745
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:23,599
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, absolutely.

1746
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,500
I mean, basically green
light CDR, the next day,

1747
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,760
you start manufacturing.

1748
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,775
So you know, every portion,
all the components,

1749
01:26:31,774 --> 01:26:34,039
all the manufacturing,
all of that

1750
01:26:34,039 --> 01:26:38,750
has been bid,
selected, contracted.

1751
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:43,590
Everything's in place
contractually, absolutely.

1752
01:26:43,590 --> 01:26:46,829
OK, any questions
at EPFL about CDR?

1753
01:26:46,829 --> 01:26:49,710
Who has actually gone
through a CDR on your end?

1754
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:53,460
Has anybody done a CDR
for any of the projects?

1755
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:55,970
OK, go ahead.

1756
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:57,329
What was it like?

1757
01:26:57,329 --> 01:27:01,949
AUDIENCE: I did also a CDR
because I had the PDR last time

1758
01:27:01,949 --> 01:27:04,289
at the [INAUDIBLE] program.

1759
01:27:04,289 --> 01:27:06,029
And one comment I want to make.

1760
01:27:06,029 --> 01:27:11,670
So the teams were allowed to
fail the PDR and still fly.

1761
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:16,510
If they failed the CDR,
then they didn't fly at all.

1762
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:19,452
So it was very
strict and demanding

1763
01:27:19,452 --> 01:27:20,909
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, so would you

1764
01:27:20,909 --> 01:27:25,050
say that the CDR is more
strict than the PDR?

1765
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:27,090
AUDIENCE: The CDR
is more strict.

1766
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:28,739
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, I agree.

1767
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:29,429
I agree.

1768
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:30,740
Definitely.

1769
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:32,809
OK, anybody else?

1770
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,640


1771
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,902
Are any of you working in
systems other than aerospace,

1772
01:27:40,902 --> 01:27:44,170
like, I don't know, medical
devices or you know,

1773
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:45,670
scientific instruments?

1774
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:50,579


1775
01:27:50,579 --> 01:27:53,159
So the reason I bring
this up is because you

1776
01:27:53,159 --> 01:28:00,599
know, medical devices have to
be approved by, here in the US,

1777
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:03,542
it's the FDA, the Food
and Drug Administration,

1778
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:05,625
and then in Europe, there
is equivalent, you know,

1779
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:07,170
European level thing.

1780
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:08,850
It's very, very detailed.

1781
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:10,329
It's really not that different.

1782
01:28:10,329 --> 01:28:13,019
So presenting your
medical device design

1783
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:14,580
to a panel of experts--

1784
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:23,409
doctors, you know, people in
medical safety, regulators--

1785
01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:26,921
it is like a CDR. You basically
are going through a CDR

1786
01:28:26,921 --> 01:28:29,170
when you're trying to get
your medical device approved

1787
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:30,430
for sale and use.

1788
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:35,350
So it's not often called a CDR,
but it effectively is a CDR.

1789
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:39,280
So this is, especially
in industries

1790
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:43,599
where there's a lot of
money at stake and people,

1791
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,829
you know, safety, people's
health is at stake,

1792
01:28:47,829 --> 01:28:50,559
this is common practice.

1793
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,570
OK, so let me summarize here.

1794
01:28:52,569 --> 01:28:55,769
So this is the detailed
design phase we discussed.

1795
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,790
It's very important.

1796
01:28:57,789 --> 01:29:00,250
Basically, you take
your PDR level design

1797
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:04,180
and you go define all the
details in full maturity.

1798
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:06,760
You create design
documents and models.

1799
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,510
And you know, as we
talked about last time,

1800
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:12,250
we're sort of in
this transition phase

1801
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:15,130
of producing documents
versus producing models.

1802
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:18,220
Typically, we have both now.

1803
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:21,520
Examples would be detailed
bill of materials,

1804
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:25,120
computer-aided design files--
we'll talk about CAD next week,

1805
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:26,590
computer-aided design--

1806
01:29:26,590 --> 01:29:28,659
software and control
system definition,

1807
01:29:28,659 --> 01:29:32,420
user interfaces, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

1808
01:29:32,420 --> 01:29:36,326
Multidisciplinary
design optimization

1809
01:29:36,326 --> 01:29:40,359
is a very powerful
concept to optimize

1810
01:29:40,359 --> 01:29:42,679
at the system and
the subsystem level

1811
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,730
and trade off between
disciplines and objectives.

1812
01:29:45,729 --> 01:29:49,039
The CDFs are the concurrent
design facilities,

1813
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,880
and they've now become standard
practice both in aerospace

1814
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,880
and product design companies.

1815
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,720
If you have not had the
chance to experience and work

1816
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:03,199
in a CDF, I really
encourage you to do this.

1817
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:05,750
I think it's a
life-changing experience.

1818
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:10,100
It really-- it's not easy,
because like, you know, Justice

1819
01:30:10,100 --> 01:30:12,740
said, there's a lot of
information to absorb.

1820
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:16,039
But once you've done
this and experienced it,

1821
01:30:16,039 --> 01:30:19,260
you realize if you
don't have a CDF,

1822
01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:23,750
if you don't design products
this way, you really should.

1823
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:26,149
And then CDR is
the big milestone,

1824
01:30:26,149 --> 01:30:30,519
the last gate before, quote,
end quote, cutting metal.

1825
01:30:30,520 --> 01:30:41,432
