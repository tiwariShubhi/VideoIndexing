OLIVIER DE WECK: Seven
miscellaneous topics, and you

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,699
may be wondering,
well, what are those?

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,719
So I'd like to start with
a general status update,

12
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,609
and then we'll go
over the master

13
00:00:36,609 --> 00:00:40,390
solution for the online quiz
that you took this week.

14
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:44,049
And then, I think,
in about 10 minutes,

15
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,019
we're going to have an
interactive discussion

16
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,210
with the INCOSE
board of directors.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,299
And so, we'll probably not get
through all the master solution

18
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:57,969
discussion by the time they
dial in, and that's OK.

19
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,844
You know, we'll just have a
15, 20 minute chat with them.

20
00:01:01,844 --> 00:01:03,759
The reason we're doing
this is because they're

21
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,950
at MIT right now for
a three day meeting,

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,109
so INCOSE's the
International National

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,179
Council of System Engineering.

24
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,760
And so we thought it would be
a nice thing since, you know,

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,090
this is a systems engineering
class, to tie in with them

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,159
and hear a little bit
of their perspective

27
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,269
on what's happening in
industry and in, sort of,

28
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:23,140
the bigger picture.

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,689
And hopefully, some
of you have got

30
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,759
a couple of questions
prepared, so we can have

31
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,079
sort of a dialogue with them.

32
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:31,280
That's the general idea.

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,400
And then we have a
presentation prepared.

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,240
The Octanis I project will be
presented from EPFL, to us,

35
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,439
and I think you'll
find it very exciting.

36
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:45,009
And so, as we listen
to that presentation,

37
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,500
put on your system
engineering thinking hat,

38
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,090
and then hopefully we'll have
time for discussion as well.

39
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,040
Let me just remind
you briefly where we

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,260
stand in terms of the class--

41
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,030
in the V-Model, in particular.

42
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,260
We made great progress,
and we've essentially

43
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,530
covered the whole
left side, the bottom.

44
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,780
And what we'll do
starting next week,

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,788
is really climb up
on the right side.

46
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:12,789
So next week's topic
is System Integration

47
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,590
and Interface Management.

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,219
Then we'll cover Verification
Validation, Commissioning

49
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:19,250
and Operations.

50
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,085
And then our final
official lecture

51
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:23,050
is Lifecycle Management.

52
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,660
We do have a 12th lecture on
Prototyping and Manufacturing.

53
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,759
That window is
optional because this

54
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,120
is after the official
end of classes at MIT.

55
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,490
So you're not expected
to participate,

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,860
but you're invited to.

57
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,620
So basically, the focus
in the next month or so

58
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,951
is covering the right side of V.

59
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:49,699
So let me start talking
about the midterm exam.

60
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:52,119
And we'll sort of go
question by question,

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,580
and please stop me if you have
any comments or questions.

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,240
Let's make this interactive.

63
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,830
So question one, if a complex
electromechanical system has

64
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:07,810
1,850 individual part numbers--
this is at the lowest level--

65
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,439
how many levels do you expect
the drawing tree to have?

66
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,229
Everybody provided the
same answer, four, right?

67
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:17,169
This is basically a
straight application

68
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:20,229
of the magic number seven rule.

69
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:27,699
And in practice, not
everybody will go exactly

70
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,419
for four levels, but
that's the basic idea.

71
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,750
If you decompose the system with
this human cognitive bandwidth

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,830
in mind, for a system of
that level of complexity,

73
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,100
you should expect, roughly,
a four layer decomposition.

74
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:46,629
So I'm very pleased that
everybody got this answer.

75
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:50,829
But with the caveat
that there may

76
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,660
be deviations from
this rule, and you

77
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:56,049
can go for a flatter
tree with fewer levels.

78
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,840
But you have to be aware
of the implications

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,890
that that may have.

80
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,559
OK, so that's great.

81
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,509


82
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,099
The next question was--

83
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,169
OK, so you're attending
a cocktail party--

84
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:14,589
and cocktail parties, I don't
think that's-- that maybe

85
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,939
that's very 20th century.

86
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,300
I don't think we have cocktail
parties anymore, so maybe more

87
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,259
like a Google Hangout or
the 21st century equivalent.

88
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:25,839
But the basic idea
here is, how would you

89
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,909
explain what system
engineering is

90
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,780
to somebody who is not
a technical person, not

91
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,129
an engineer?

92
00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:35,509
And I think most of you--

93
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,769
I looked through all the
answers, and most of you

94
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:42,759
basically provided a definition
of system engineering

95
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,680
that we would use in
this class, right.

96
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,720
So it was like, OK, well, not
quite what I was looking for

97
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,730
but not incorrect.

98
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,980
So I pulled out two
examples that I kind of

99
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,840
liked because they brought in
analogies from other fields

100
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:00,909
as to what system
engineering is.

101
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,720
So the first one here is, OK,
so system engineering represents

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,400
a method but also a mindset
that enables the design and so

103
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,509
forth of successful systems,
but systems engineering

104
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:16,029
is like cooking
a delicious cake.

105
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,933
OK, so it's like cooking
a delicious recipe.

106
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,850
You've got your ingredients
which is your part

107
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,042
numbers, or your parts, right?

108
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:29,039
You have a process
that you're following.

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,860
And at the end of it you
should have something special,

110
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,139
something delicious,
something wholesome,

111
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:39,099
something that is greater
than the sum of the parts.

112
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,960
I don't know if any of you
watch the Food Channel?

113
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,169
Anybody watching the
Food Network here?

114
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,250
Yeah?

115
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,970
OK.

116
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,160
We actually like to watch it.

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,540
It's kind of fun.

118
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,129
And what's fun is when you give
the same ingredients to, like,

119
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,750
half a dozen different people--

120
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,319
and same ingredients,
same amount of time,

121
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,149
and the result that comes out
of it is vastly different.

122
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:04,899
Now, why is that?

123
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:06,789
Of course, you can say
skills and so forth,

124
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,950
but it is fundamentally,
because those ingredients--

125
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,279
that details matter.

126
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,449
The way in which the
ingredients get combined.

127
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:18,959
And you know, did you
use the right heat?

128
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,039
Did you did you take
it off the heat?

129
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,780
30 seconds too soon or too
late, those little details

130
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:29,589
make a huge difference
to the final product, OK.

131
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,849
And that's what I think what's
cool about the Food Network

132
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:36,820
and cooking in general.

133
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,529
Cuisine, it's an art.

134
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,409
It's not just follow the recipe.

135
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,070
And so, I think that's
a great analogy.

136
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,519
I like that.

137
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,680
And then the other one is--

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,750
so you're talking
to Cher, the singer,

139
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:59,259
and explain to her that system
engineering is like a concert.

140
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:03,610
So in a concert you have
all your specialists, right?

141
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,199
You have your choir maybe.

142
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,389
You have your strings section.

143
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,370
You have your trumpets.

144
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,230
And I think it's
kind of similar.

145
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,020
You could have great
individual musicians,

146
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:19,449
but if the conductor is not
bringing everybody into harmony

147
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,339
then you get a cacophony.

148
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:25,119
It's not a great result.
So a great orchestra

149
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,949
is not just a bunch of
great individual musicians,

150
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,500
but it's the idea that
you're orchestrating--

151
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,050
there's something
special that emerges

152
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,860
if you synchronize everybody in
a way-- and you motivate them,

153
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,740
and you synchronize them,
and something really special

154
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,230
happens.

155
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,629
I think that's another
great sort of example

156
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,360
of what we mean by
system engineering

157
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,129
in the technical world.

158
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,610
This idea of a conductor
bringing everybody in harmony,

159
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,930
and the end result is
something really special.

160
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,550
That's a little bit what I was
looking for in this answer,

161
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,050
and I like both
of these examples.

162
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,829


163
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:11,680
The third question
was about the V-Model.

164
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,670
And I think, based on what I
looked through the answers,

165
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,370
I think most people
really understood that.

166
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,899
And just to summarize, again,
in a very, very simple way what

167
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,639
the V-Model is all
about-- so here's

168
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,389
the V. If you wanted
to really simplify it,

169
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,329
we start at the upper
left with a vision.

170
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:35,000
You know, what is it that
we're trying to accomplish?

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,100
And that's where you
need to understand,

172
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,580
who's the stakeholder,
who are the customers,

173
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,780
the thing that you're about
to create doesn't exist yet.

174
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:46,480
In some projects you actually
start with an initial system,

175
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,409
and you need to improve it.

176
00:08:48,409 --> 00:08:52,779
So you're starting with
generation N of a product,

177
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,769
and the goal is to create
generation N plus 1, which is

178
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,909
better in several dimensions.

179
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,850
So that's possible,
but let's just

180
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,639
say we have a clean
sheet situation.

181
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:07,240
And you have a vision
that you're developing.

182
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,610
And then you [INAUDIBLE]

183
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,316
TINA: Hi, Ollie, is that you?

184
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,970
OLIVIER DE WECK: Aha, OK.

185
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,580
TINA: All right, you are
now connected on speaker

186
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,830
with the INCOSE
Board of Directors.

187
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,850
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Fantastic, can you hear me?

188
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,629
GUEST SPEAKER: No.

189
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,189
TINA: Yes, we can.

190
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,840
GUEST SPEAKER: Loud and clear.

191
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,910
OLIVIER DE WECK: All
right, this is great.

192
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:32,969
So I was just going over the
midterm exam that we just had,

193
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,870
and so I will stop doing that
because we're very glad that we

194
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,759
can spend time with you.

195
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,129
So let's make this
bigger on our end.

196
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,899


197
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:55,230
And do you have a camera
on your end, Tina?

198
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,730


199
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,330
DAVID: Let's say no because
of the demographics here,

200
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,770
so we'll have to
go on voice, Ollie.

201
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:08,840
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
Tina, can we see you?

202
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,375
Can we see one of you at least?

203
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,538
[INAUDIBLE]

204
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:15,879


205
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,701
[INAUDIBLE] can stand
there at look presidential.

206
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:22,159
GUEST SPEAKER:
We're working on it.

207
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,759
TINA: How about I figure it
out while you give the intro?

208
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,592
DAVID: There you go.

209
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,211
Thank you, Tina.

210
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,570
GUEST SPEAKER: Multi-task.

211
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,950
OLIVIER DE WECK: It
would be helpful to see

212
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,991
at least who is speaking.

213
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,600


214
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,360
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:54,303


216
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,970
DAVID: I know, we've
got a problem here.

217
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,570
TINA: All right, you
stand over there.

218
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,023
I'll point this to you.

219
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:01,127


220
00:11:01,126 --> 00:11:03,459
DAVID: Well, shall we go ahead
and kick off here, Ollie?

221
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,710
I know your time is valuable.

222
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,570
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

223
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,660
Ryan can we make
the INCOSE Board

224
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:15,860
of Directors the
main screen here?

225
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,480
Just give me one
second on our end.

226
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:35,579


227
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,370
GUEST SPEAKER: Ollie,
can I suggest we just

228
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,299
press ahead despite the desire
to see David's shiny face?

229
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:44,490


230
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,730
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

231
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,639
All right, so David, it's
great to talk to you.

232
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:52,990
So let me just give you a
little bit of background here.

233
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,799
We have about 20
students here at MIT.

234
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,929
Currently, we're
taking the Fundamentals

235
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:00,659
of Systems Engineering class.

236
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,129
We're roughly midterm, a
little bit past the midterm.

237
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:07,779
And then we have about 20
students, maybe 15 students,

238
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,659
and staff at EPFL
in Switzerland,

239
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:13,929
and we're teaching this class
in the form of the SPOC, Small

240
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:16,000
Private Online Course.

241
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,850
And so, welcome to MIT, to
the INCOSE Board of Directors.

242
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,759
I know you've already had
very productive times.

243
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:28,629
And we're really excited to
hear from you as to not just

244
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:31,419
what is INCOSE, but
where do you see

245
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,990
Systems Engineering as a field
of study and practice stand.

246
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:38,480
You know, what are the
exciting things happening?

247
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,090
What are the challenges?

248
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,480
And whatever you would
choose to share with us.

249
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,200
So, David.

250
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,250
DAVID: Very good.

251
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,070
Thanks, Ollie.

252
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,340
And thank you for making
the time available.

253
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,690
It is always great to talk
with the next generation.

254
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:55,220
I'll give you just a
few comments up front

255
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,080
and then really open it up.

256
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,540
For those who aren't
familiar with INCOSE,

257
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,549
it's the International Council
on Systems Engineering.

258
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,829
It's about 25 years old, about
10,000 members worldwide.

259
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,200
And the value of
INCOSE, fundamentally,

260
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,759
is to serve as a connector
across the systems community,

261
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,490
across organizational
boundaries,

262
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,580
across geographic boundaries,
so that we can connect

263
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,270
the practice in the US to
Europe to Asia and beyond--

264
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,009
they are applied differently--

265
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:28,700
and across domain boundaries,
from military and aerospace,

266
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,900
where we have our foundation,
to automotive to medical devices

267
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,789
and beyond.

268
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,730
If you look at it as
systems engineers,

269
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,950
that's perhaps the most exciting
thing of what's going on.

270
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,350
If you look at how complexity
continues to emerge and grow,

271
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,200
the problems that we are
being asked to tackle,

272
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,330
the technologies
at our disposal,

273
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,290
the opportunities for
wonderful outcomes,

274
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:59,000
the dangers and risks of
unintended consequences--

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,070
the challenges that
the world faces are,

276
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,810
absolutely, System's challenges.

277
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:06,379
And they are far beyond
the traditional aerospace

278
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,509
and defense domain.

279
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:09,480
They are everywhere.

280
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,730
I was with GM earlier this week,
looking at automated driving

281
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,409
and auto assist.

282
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:19,100
I was with medical devices
in iRobot yesterday.

283
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,790
And wherever you look,
whatever domain you work in,

284
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:26,509
we see complexity, we
see systems challenges,

285
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:29,870
and we see tremendous
opportunities for us,

286
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,629
as professionals,
but more than that,

287
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:37,700
for systems professionals to
have a profound positive impact

288
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,170
on the world.

289
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,589
So it's going to be a
very challenging journey.

290
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,830
We are still working to
solidify our foundation

291
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,080
to advance our theories,
to advance our practice.

292
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,680
But it is a very fruitful
time, I think, as well.

293
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,549
So those were the comments
that I will offer at the start,

294
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:58,939
and then open it up to the
class to ask the questions

295
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,100
of this board of directors.

296
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,800
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
David, that was great.

297
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,409
And so, who wants to be first?

298
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:12,509
Don't be shy-- either
here at MIT or at EPFL.

299
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:15,559
Sam, go for it.

300
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,539
SAM: I was wondering when
you're creating, I guess,

301
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:24,799
INCOSE standards for systems
engineering processes,

302
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,339
what considerations do you
take into account in order

303
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,330
to make them applicable for
such a wide range of disciplines

304
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:32,895
or domains?

305
00:15:32,894 --> 00:15:36,615


306
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,490
DAVID: Introduce yourself
for whoever speaks.

307
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,906
PAUL: this is Paul
Schreinmarkers.

308
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:41,209
I'm the technical director.

309
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,750
Thank you for asking.

310
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:48,690
Well, actually, INCOSE is
not a standard setting body,

311
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:54,480
but we are supporting a lot
of standards like ISO 15288.

312
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,610
And what we at
least try to achieve

313
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:01,259
is that the standards are being
applied in multiple domains

314
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,110
as much as possible.

315
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,529
Does that answer your question?

316
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:08,240
SAM: Yeah, thanks.

317
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,740
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, and just so you

318
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,750
know we do have
15288 as one of the--

319
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,419
in the class here, we covered,
sort of, three standards.

320
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:20,349
One is the System Engineering
Handbook, the [? NASA, ?]

321
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,980
of course, the INCOSE
Handbook, and then 15288.

322
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,730
So I think the students
should be familiar

323
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,200
with [? 15288, ?]
so that was good.

324
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,170
OK, can we have a
question from EPFL?

325
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:44,329


326
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,720
Are you still with us, guys?

327
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,375


328
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,639
- Hello, do you hear me?

329
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:51,855
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, good.

330
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,039
- OK, yes.

331
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,620
[INAUDIBLE] just have a question
about the complexity of systems

332
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,649
with new systems being more
and more complex over time,

333
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:05,578
would system engineers,
or engineering itself,

334
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,740
have to reinvent
itself in the future?

335
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,836
And what would be the direction?

336
00:17:09,836 --> 00:17:10,608
Thank you.

337
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:13,101


338
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:15,060
ALAN HARDING: Hi there,
it's Alan Harding here.

339
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:18,450
I'm president-elect at INCOSE,
but more importantly, I

340
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,480
co-chair our system and
systems working group.

341
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,049
I think the answer
is no to reinvention

342
00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:28,299
because I'm confident
all the principles stand.

343
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,950
But what we've been
doing as a working group,

344
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,769
is identifying where
engineering a system and systems

345
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:35,710
are different.

346
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:39,269
We constructed a paper,
which has been published,

347
00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:41,400
on the pain point to
the system of systems,

348
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,420
looking at the managerial and
the technical differences,

349
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,450
and therefore, helping people,
when planning their work,

350
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,170
see in which cases they can
pick up their traditional ways

351
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,200
of looking--

352
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,539
and where, if you, like,
experienced practitioners,

353
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,359
see problems or
challenges in other areas.

354
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:01,429
So that working group
is helping develop--

355
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,015
so understand and develop
the state practice

356
00:18:04,015 --> 00:18:06,810
for complex system of
systems, and that's

357
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:08,940
proved quite influential.

358
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,930
And in fact, if you all using
the latest edition of the SE

359
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,490
handbook, in the section
on system of systems,

360
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,069
it does highlight
those pain points.

361
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:22,419
So they are there helping
shape what people do.

362
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,596
Hopefully, that's of use?

363
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,970
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Thank you, Alan.

364
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,579
Very good.

365
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:30,869
I think we've only mentioned
system of systems in the class

366
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:31,369
so far.

367
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,039
We haven't really deep
dived into that topic,

368
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,230
but it's a great point.

369
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,319
OK, and back to MIT.

370
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:43,220
AUDIENCE: Hi, my question is
about the systems engineering

371
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,750
vision you have on the
web site about 2025.

372
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,490
What has been done about the
protocols or languages that

373
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,279
could be developed to
facilitate the communication

374
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,129
between the systems
engineering professionals

375
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,409
and different stakeholders?

376
00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:02,950
MIKE: That's a really
good question--

377
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,039
you know, this idea of
having the same language.

378
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,250
By the way, I'm Mike Celentano,
deputy technical director

379
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,539
of operations.

380
00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:14,531
The idea of having a common
language is really important.

381
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:16,990
One of the things that I've
struggled with in health care--

382
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,819
that's my industry--

383
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:23,559
is trying to convince people
to speak the same language,

384
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,509
and I've since given that up.

385
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:27,789
What I'm teaching people
now is to understand

386
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:30,009
the other people's
language, so that they

387
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,329
can communicate better.

388
00:19:31,329 --> 00:19:33,519
And so when you go
from domain to domain,

389
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,710
it's important that you
spend some time learning

390
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,809
the language, a lot like
it's important to learn

391
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,539
how to say hello and goodbye
in the language of the country

392
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:41,889
that you're visiting.

393
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,490
It's important to understand the
domain that you're exploring,

394
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,529
so that you can make
the interpretation

395
00:19:47,529 --> 00:19:50,500
and help those people
with systems engineering.

396
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,640
Does that answer your question?

397
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,957
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

398
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:57,290
DAVID: Ollie, if you don't
mind, I'm going to follow up,

399
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:59,359
and then Art will as well.

400
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,459
What that question
calls out, and what

401
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,470
I think Mike's
answer calls out, is

402
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,089
there are two very important
dimensions, in my opinion,

403
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:09,589
of systems engineering.

404
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:11,750
We are the glue to
the project team,

405
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,640
but we are the glue in
two different dimensions.

406
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,060
There is the engineering
aspect of what we do,

407
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,329
and there is very real
engineering analysis that needs

408
00:20:20,329 --> 00:20:22,099
to occur at the systems level.

409
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:24,289
We unify the subject
matter experts,

410
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,710
and we bring those
understandings together

411
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,160
whether it's in medical, whether
it's in aerospace, regardless.

412
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,730
But the other aspect that
we cannot avoid as systems

413
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,670
engineers, is the
communication role.

414
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,440
Because we are
working with people

415
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,480
who do not speak the
same common language,

416
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,589
whether that's speaking
between aerospace and medical,

417
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,990
or whether that's on
an aerospace project

418
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,359
speaking between
computer science,

419
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:52,639
reliability,
mechanical, electrical.

420
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,259
As systems engineers, we must
embrace the communication

421
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,069
aspect and the translator
aspect that Mike called out,

422
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:02,990
because each of us speak
a different language

423
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,920
for a particular reason.

424
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,420
Art?

425
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,240
ART: And to help in that
regard, one of the products

426
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,230
that INCOSE has helped create
is a systems engineering

427
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:21,380
body of knowledge, which is
available on a website, which

428
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,780
Ollie is quite familiar with--

429
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:26,299
which has several
hundred articles

430
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,549
about systems engineering.

431
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,119
But one of the projects
that we are going to be--

432
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,250
and it's its domain
neutral, so it's not

433
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,829
tied to a specific
business sector.

434
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:41,629
One of the projects that we are
expecting to begin in 2016 is

435
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,890
to create a variant of
that, in some fashion,

436
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,270
for the health care community--
tying it to the unique way they

437
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,160
talk about things--

438
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,130
their approaches, but tie it
back to the common underlying

439
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,400
principles.

440
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,180
And if we are successful
in that, as we expect,

441
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,660
I can imagine us spinning
up ones for transportation,

442
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,720
for telecommunications,
et cetera.

443
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,920
So that that can become a
glue, in essence, for people

444
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,130
across many different
business sectors.

445
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,780
OLIVIER DE WECK: Very good.

446
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:17,269
So I will make sure
that we provide

447
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,910
the link to the body of
knowledge, which I know

448
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,330
was a very big effort
to put together.

449
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:27,369
We'll provide that information
for the students as well.

450
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:29,529
TINA: Great, that's excellent.

451
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:31,089
Unfortunately, for
time, I'm going

452
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,269
to have to ask Art
to give us a wrap up.

453
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,940
But let me just say one
thing because I'm not sure

454
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,519
how well you can see
the video over here.

455
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,400
But you guys are talking to
a group of about 20 people

456
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
from around the world.

457
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,170
We have people here from
France, Sweden, Australia.

458
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,120
And the people that
you just talked to

459
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:58,839
are also senior engineering
leaders that Airbus and BAE,

460
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:03,129
and so they kind of arrange a
broad spectrum here-- and also

461
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,510
rose from different industries.

462
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:09,609
So I'll hand it over to Art
to give you a good summary,

463
00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:13,413
but I hope that you continue to
keep in touch with this group.

464
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:14,829
GUEST SPEAKER:
Well, this is where

465
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:18,429
I'm going to make my small
pitch for membership.

466
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:24,250
So as students, you have an
opportunity for only 38 dollars

467
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:30,339
US annually to be members of
INCOSE, which gives you access

468
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:34,419
to all of our products,
which includes videos

469
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,029
that are recorded
every month, handbooks,

470
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:39,940
all sorts of documents.

471
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,920
And I'd really like
to encourage you

472
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,710
to consider that as an option.

473
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,610
It's great.

474
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,149
It's something like a
quarter of what you'd have

475
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:52,920
to pay as a full professional.

476
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,869
And so I'm going to
let it go with that.

477
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,909
OLIVIER DE WECK: No, Art,
I think that was great.

478
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,920
And I'll just say
from my perspective,

479
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,759
I first got involved in INCOSE
a little more than a decade ago,

480
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,900
and I think both the
industry-academic mix,

481
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,120
the conferences-- you
know, this is real.

482
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,099
This is not a community
that's living in a bubble,

483
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,859
and so I would I would
fully endorse, Art.

484
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:22,179


485
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,799
All right, well, I think we're
at the end of this interview.

486
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,819
You know, this is cool.

487
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:29,679
I mean, that technology
has gotten to the point

488
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,720
where, certainly, the
audio part of this

489
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,930
was very clear for all of
us, and that's terrific.

490
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,580
So we want to thank
you for your time.

491
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:43,419
Have a great continuation
of your board meeting,

492
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,904
and we're going to keep
learning over here.

493
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,000
DAVID: Very good.

494
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,189
Thank you so much, Ollie.

495
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,230
GUEST SPEAKER: Thank you.

496
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:53,720
OLIVIER DE WECK: Take care.

497
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,289
All right, well, I hope
you found that useful.

498
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:01,490
And I'll provide you a link
to the body of knowledge.

499
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,980
I think that's one thing that
we haven't sort of pointed out.

500
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,829
So let's go back to--

501
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:09,139
EPFL, are you still with us?

502
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,000


503
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,366
GUEST SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

504
00:25:15,366 --> 00:25:16,450
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

505
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:18,190
Thank you.

506
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,519
So let me just sort of
finish on the midterm.

507
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,240
Yes, Veronica?

508
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,895
VERONICA: [INAUDIBLE] can I
ask, a question I would have

509
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:26,076
asked to the board, to you?

510
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:26,910
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

511
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,772


512
00:25:29,771 --> 00:25:30,665
VERONICA: Thank you.

513
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,289
When I was looking
over their web site,

514
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:33,970
I see a lot about
kind of communicating

515
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,200
for the sake of engineers
and everything else.

516
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,410
But I think that systems
engineering, in particular,

517
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,550
has an ability to shape the
way that we kind of regulate

518
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:43,490
policy developments.

519
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,530
I feel like a lot of times
scientific advancement

520
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:48,250
is working against international
regulatory standards, where

521
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,990
I feel like an
entity like INCOSE

522
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,200
has an ability to kind of shape
international collaboration

523
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,569
in a way that can help
scientists achieve more

524
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:56,919
together.

525
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,370
And so I was kind of wondering
what the role they might have

526
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,929
seen-- or what you
might see as kind

527
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,029
of an international
collaboration,

528
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:08,920
like that, taking, in terms of
shaping the ways in which we

529
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,340
engineer together-- not just the
ways in which we kind of create

530
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:14,259
in systems engineering
naturally, but kind

531
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:16,150
of more collaborative.

532
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,250
OLIVIER DE WECK: I think
it's a great question.

533
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,440
And I think the system
engineering is sort

534
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,180
of evolving and broadening.

535
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,700
The classic view of system
engineering is you know,

536
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,170
that's what a company
or a big project

537
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,680
that's producing a physical
deliverable, a new airplane,

538
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:38,320
a new computer, health care
device, a new software system.

539
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,210
That's the out-- you
know, and then that's

540
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,370
a capability that you
put out into the market

541
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,959
and to the field.

542
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,819
And regulations and
policies are given to you--

543
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,869
you know, their constraints,
their requirements.

544
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:53,229
I think what you're saying is,
well, the policies, themselves,

545
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,894
are something to be designed--

546
00:26:54,894 --> 00:26:55,769
VERONICA: I think so.

547
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:57,185
OLIVIER DE WECK:
--and negotiated.

548
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,859
And that's a broadening
of the system boundary

549
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,199
and the mandate for
system engineering.

550
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,759
And so here, at MIT, over
the last 15 years or so,

551
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,519
the word we've used for that
is, engineering systems.

552
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:11,559
So we kind of flipped
the two words,

553
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:14,710
and say that system engineering,
in a more traditional sense,

554
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,980
is scope, scope, smaller.

555
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,730
And then when you
internalize the externalities

556
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,910
like economics, policy,
and you consider

557
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,970
that part of the
design space as well,

558
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,299
then you're in the world
of engineering systems

559
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:33,789
or complex
sociotechnical systems.

560
00:27:33,789 --> 00:27:36,351
And so, absolutely, there's a--

561
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:39,790
and you heard the answer
that Alan Harding, who's

562
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:41,539
the President-elect of INCOSE.

563
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:44,619
He will take over from
Dave Long next year.

564
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,479
When he started talking
about system of systems--

565
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,420
well, you know, what
our system of systems?

566
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,390
For example, air
traffic management.

567
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,370
Let's take an example,
air traffic management,

568
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:55,969
air transportation.

569
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,100
In North America, there's
this project called next-gen--

570
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:02,079
right, next generation--

571
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,689
that's a very complex
system of systems.

572
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:08,370
And in Europe, the equivalent
is a project called SESAR.

573
00:28:08,369 --> 00:28:11,689
It's essentially the
Unified European airspace.

574
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,590
Well, you've got-- it's not
just about flight controllers,

575
00:28:14,589 --> 00:28:18,490
and radar stations, and
GPS-enabled navigation.

576
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,890
A lot of it has
to do with policy.

577
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,080
And how do you do the hand offs?

578
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:27,730
Who is responsible to
report any anomalies?

579
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,829
How do you do backup operations?

580
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:30,589
And so forth.

581
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:33,819
So a good example when
that came to the fore is--

582
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:36,339
I don't know if you remember
the Icelandic volcano

583
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,659
a few years ago?

584
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,440
The volcano erupted, and then
there was this big ash cloud.

585
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,340
And then the question
was, well, is it

586
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:47,409
safe to fly through
this ash cloud?

587
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,720
And who actually
has the authority

588
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,413
to decide which part of the
airspace is closed and is open?

589
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,079
And then you've got
the airlines saying,

590
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,960
you know, open up the
airspace because we're losing

591
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,700
a lot of business every day.

592
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:04,029
And the regulators
are saying, wait,

593
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:06,430
we need to be cautious here.

594
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,220
So I think what you're saying
is that's a system engineering

595
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,490
problem that we could
sort of address.

596
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,750
And so things are
moving that way,

597
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,869
but I think our
methodologies for doing

598
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:20,000
that work in a rigorous way
are not quite there yet.

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,940
It's still evolving,
but great question.

600
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,440
VERONICA: Is that
a type of advocacy

601
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,160
that a group like INCOSE
could move toward?

602
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,710
I can see from their mission
statement and everything,

603
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,210
that's something
they are doing now.

604
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,552
But is that a place that you
see that they could fill?

605
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:34,759
OLIVIER DE WECK: It could be.

606
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:37,180
And I think I think
they're moving that way.

607
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,039
VERONICA: Thank you.

608
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:38,955
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

609
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:41,139
OK, any other
points anybody wants

610
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,220
to add from the discussion?

611
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:44,720
OK.

612
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,329
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one
question from our side--

613
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:47,413
OLIVIER DE WECK: Go ahead.

614
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,630
AUDIENCE: --if I can.

615
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,560
So I think that's a very
good point, Veronica,

616
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,619
in terms of how do you transfer
this to policy or business

617
00:29:54,619 --> 00:29:56,096
management?

618
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,430
Some time ago, I was trying
to see if there are actually

619
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,730
jobs or careers that are
called systems engineer,

620
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:05,900
but besides IT, there's
really not a profession.

621
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,259
For example, if you're doing
this in the policy domain,

622
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:12,890
could you just be the systems
engineer of, say for example,

623
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,036
the Swiss energy--
you know, what

624
00:30:15,036 --> 00:30:17,160
I'm working on currently--
kind of the Swiss energy

625
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,650
transition-- you know,
the systems engineer,

626
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,920
and that would be your role.

627
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,740
Are their careers
and career names

628
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,779
that are explicitly, like,
designing the systems

629
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,089
and engineering them?

630
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:30,839
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's
a question, right?

631
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:39,419


632
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,539
Katya, I think the mic is off.

633
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:44,315
Go ahead.

634
00:30:44,315 --> 00:30:45,760
AUDIENCE: Hear me now?

635
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,066
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes.

636
00:30:48,066 --> 00:30:50,960
AUDIENCE: Are there
jobs that do this?

637
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,930
Are there systems
engineering jobs,

638
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,224
or is that project management?

639
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:56,889
OLIVIER DE WECK:
That's a good question.

640
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:02,560
So the job profiles of system
engineers have been broadening.

641
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,690
There is also,
system architects.

642
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,370


643
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:10,029
When we talk about
concept generation here,

644
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:13,399
concept selection,
that's, in a sense,

645
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,440
a specialty within
system engineering

646
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
known as system architecture.

647
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,190
So you'll have more and
more people hand you

648
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,190
a business card that says,
I'm the system architect.

649
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,700
And what that means is they're
in charge of the high level

650
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,480
decisions, the upper left side
of the V that's shown here.

651
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,110
So system architect,
system engineers.

652
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:35,809
And there's also a very--
this didn't come up

653
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:37,730
in the discussion with
INCOSE, but there's

654
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,890
a very active discussion
going on right now

655
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:44,120
between INCOSE, that
has about 10,000 members

656
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,989
and is 25 years old,
and an organization

657
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,339
called PMI, Project Management
Institute, which is older

658
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:55,799
and has about 400,000
members globally.

659
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,450
And that's the people
running big projects.

660
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,640
So those job
descriptions are still

661
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,950
coming from different
angles, but we

662
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,500
do see this bigger
discussion emerging.

663
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,920
And I think the organizations
that are enlightened,

664
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:13,009
that really understand that
these big system decisions are

665
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:17,329
critical-- and that you can't
just make those arbitrarily.

666
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,679
You need people who actually
think about the whole system,

667
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,000
who model and simulate
the whole system, who

668
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,589
look at different scenarios.

669
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,659
You need dedicated
people for that.

670
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,250
Who not just have the education
and the experience to do it,

671
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,490
but have the job title to do
it as well, and the authority.

672
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,190
And so, I think we're
seeing a transition

673
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,420
to those new kinds of jobs,
especially in the enlightened

674
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:44,130
organizations.

675
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,550
OK.

676
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:46,129
Yes?

677
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,380
VERONICA: One more, I promise.

678
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,830
OLIVIER DE WECK: One more
and then we'll move on.

679
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:49,329
Yep?

680
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,289
VERONICA: So when
you say that someone

681
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:52,538
needs to have a designated
title of a systems engineer

682
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:56,230
to really do it well, is there
an advantage or disadvantage

683
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:59,774
to having everyone be a systems
engineer with a specialty,

684
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:01,689
so that you're training
an entire organization

685
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,620
to think about the big picture?

686
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,899
Because I can see pros and
cons, but I'm wondering,

687
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,781
is there a hard
answer either way.

688
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,279
OLIVIER DE WECK:
My position on this

689
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,349
is-- you remember, we
talked a little bit

690
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:14,230
about the value of
system engineering,

691
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,569
like how much should you
invest in system engineering?

692
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,759
And we'll come back to
this at the end of term.

693
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:21,819
But generally, you
can see that there's

694
00:33:21,819 --> 00:33:26,139
empirical data that says you
should spend roughly 10% to 20%

695
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,090
of your budget--

696
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,759
maybe 15% is sort
of the sweet spot--

697
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,509
on systems engineering, system
architecture type activities,

698
00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:38,259
which happens to be 1 in 7.

699
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:41,470
1 over 7, that's
15% roughly, right?

700
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,309
So if you're going to,
on average, decompose

701
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:51,009
your systems into seven chunks
at each level of decomposition

702
00:33:51,009 --> 00:33:55,299
then you need about one
out of seven people--

703
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,059
or one out of eight or
one out of seven people--

704
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:01,480
their primary focus should be
on how the chunks fit together,

705
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,810
not designing the
individual chunks.

706
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,559
And so there's a lot
of empirical evidence

707
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,849
that suggests that if you spend
a lot less effort on system

708
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:13,239
integration than about
15% of your total budget,

709
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,190
you're going to
have real problems.

710
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,719
You will miss requirements.

711
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,670
You'll have poorly
managed interfaces.

712
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,250
You'll have surprises
during testing.

713
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,639
If you spend a lot more than
15% on system engineering

714
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,579
activities, the project
will be very heavy,

715
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:31,569
too much bureaucracy,
too many processes.

716
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,949
It gets slower.

717
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:35,710
So we'll come back to that.

718
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,920
But everybody should
have some understanding

719
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,010
of what system engineering is
even if you're a subject matter

720
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,699
expert specialty person,
if you do cost modeling,

721
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:50,320
or if you do control
systems, propulsion,

722
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,239
in the medical field,
biocompatible materials.

723
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:56,320
Whatever it is you do,
everybody should know something

724
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,000
about system engineering.

725
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,750
But then you do need, that's my
opinion, the dedicated people

726
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,769
who really focus on the
integration, the interfaces,

727
00:35:05,769 --> 00:35:08,259
how the chunks fit together.

728
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:10,780
And if you don't have
that for projects

729
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:14,080
that are of a certain
level of complexity,

730
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,849
you're going to
have big problems.

731
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:21,059
OK, Katya, was that
was that reasonable?

732
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:22,110
All right.

733
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:26,730
So let's move on here with the
exam because we have a very,

734
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,400
I think, exciting, interesting
presentation to get to.

735
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,519
So the V is essentially--
you have this vision.

736
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:36,449
You then decompose
requirements, subsystems.

737
00:35:36,449 --> 00:35:38,909
And then the bottom of
the V is the details.

738
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:42,269
Every little detail
needs to be defined.

739
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:45,960
And then the right side is we
go and then integrate everything

740
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,699
together, and we
go to operations.

741
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:53,460
So I think most of you really
explained that quite well.

742
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:57,059
Question four, what is
the most important aspect

743
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,404
of the V-model that is not
shown explicitly in the V?

744
00:36:00,405 --> 00:36:03,000


745
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,670
There are two answers here,
and I think both are correct.

746
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,980
The iterative nature
of design, we'll

747
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,280
hear about this in
the Octanis project.

748
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,790
So the V-model does not imply
that you're automatically doing

749
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,710
a waterfall stage gate process.

750
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:20,610
You're only doing
trade studies once.

751
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,530
You're only testing once.

752
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,920
That's not what it means.

753
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,970
It just means that
there's a logical sequence

754
00:36:26,969 --> 00:36:28,919
to the activities,
but you could actually

755
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,670
spiral through the V multiple
times, so the iterative nature

756
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,240
of design.

757
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,599
And then the possibility of
schedule and cost overruns,

758
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,650
this is the programmatic side,
is not shown in the V-model,

759
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,000
but it's implied.

760
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,050
So both of these are correct,
so this is very good.

761
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,530
Question five, at which of
the following milestones

762
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:52,620
should the main concept, or
architecture, of the system

763
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,659
selected-- so here
we have a little bit

764
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,969
of a spread of answers.

765
00:36:56,969 --> 00:37:02,250
The correct answer here should
be PDR, Polygyny Design Review.

766
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,070
That's when the concept, the
architecture, the high level

767
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,910
decomposition of the system,
the assignment of functions

768
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:14,409
to those chunks at level one or
level two, should be defined.

769
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,559
SRR, it's too early.

770
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,130
All you're trying to do at
the SRR, System Requirements

771
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,380
Review, is agree on what
the requirements are,

772
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,269
what the system should achieve,
but not necessarily how

773
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,769
that will be achieved.

774
00:37:28,769 --> 00:37:32,070
And then at CDR, I
would say it's too late.

775
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:35,160
The CDR is where you
lay out all the details

776
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:38,859
of how the system will be
built, operated, the software.

777
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,420
So that the high level design,
the concept, the architecture,

778
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,740
should have been decided and
agreed upon way before the CDR,

779
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,000
and it's the PDR where
that's happening.

780
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,980
So I think about 3/4 of
you got it right here.

781
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:58,074
The next one was a
little subtle question.

782
00:37:58,074 --> 00:37:59,740
What are the following
attributes should

783
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:02,250
a set of requirements meet?

784
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,460
And I put check marks here
between what were the--

785
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,740
so there were multiple
correct answers.

786
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:11,819
The set of requirements
means multiple,

787
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,800
an ensemble of
requirements, as opposed

788
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,590
to just a single
requirement in isolation.

789
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,300
So, feasible, verifiable,
and unambiguous,

790
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,830
those three answers are correct
for individual requirements.

791
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:29,190
Each individual requirement
should be feasible, verifiable,

792
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,960
and unambiguous.

793
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,940
But when you look at
a set of requirements,

794
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,829
that's when these other
three come into play,

795
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,529
absence of redundancy.

796
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,460
So what this means is that
you shouldn't replicate

797
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,110
the same requirement,
essentially,

798
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:47,190
across multiple requirements
in your requirements set.

799
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,780
And one of the
reasons for that is

800
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,840
if you change a requirement
then you might miss it

801
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,910
somewhere else, right.

802
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:57,389
This redundancy is-- keep it
as simple, as straightforward

803
00:38:57,389 --> 00:38:58,949
as you can.

804
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:01,379
Completeness, that
basically means

805
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,630
that the requirements
set that you develop

806
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,190
should cover all
the requirements.

807
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,639
You shouldn't have big holes
and missing requirements.

808
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,059
And then the last point
is absence of conflicts.

809
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:14,820
If you have requirements
conflicts, essentially,

810
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:19,510
what this means is there's
no feasible solution.

811
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,440
So if you think
about optimization,

812
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,450
you have an
over-constrained problem.

813
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,329
Basically, that's
what that means.

814
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,449
OK?

815
00:39:27,449 --> 00:39:30,500
Any questions about these two?

816
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:35,250
AUDIENCE: Yes, I have a
question for question five.

817
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,869
I think the question
is a little bit

818
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:40,849
ambiguous because if
the main concept is

819
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:42,529
selected on the PDR--

820
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:47,330
on a timescale on the CDR,
you have the main concept.

821
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:52,860
So you can say that
on the CDR, it's

822
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,610
also the main concept
selected already.

823
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:00,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Ah, I
see what you're saying.

824
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,789
Yeah, so maybe I
should have said,

825
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:07,110
what is the earliest milestone
at which the concept--

826
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,750
that's really what
I meant, is what's

827
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:14,400
the milestone where the concept
has to be agreed upon, and then

828
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,450
of course, at the CDR--

829
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,359


830
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,930
unless you had to overturn
your concept selection,

831
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:23,059
which happens sometimes--

832
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:25,500
you should stick with the same.

833
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,400
But the intent here was
to say, this is PDR.

834
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,160
OK, go ahead.

835
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:32,980
AUDIENCE: For this
question, number five,

836
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,199
I think I got concepts
of operations confused

837
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,769
with the concept architecture.

838
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:42,050
So just to be clear about
that, the concept of operations

839
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:46,880
is what the system
does, and architecture

840
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,996
just a list of the subsystems
and what are the mass, energy,

841
00:40:49,996 --> 00:40:50,869
and information flow?

842
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:51,920
Is that correct?

843
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,170
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's right.

844
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,059
The concept of operations,
that's actually an SRR type.

845
00:40:56,059 --> 00:40:57,199
The concept of operations--

846
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:57,649
AUDIENCE: That's what I put.

847
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:00,200
OLIVIER DE WECK: --how will
the system be used, right?

848
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,899
And then the concept,
the architecture

849
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,050
is, given this
concept of operations,

850
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,330
what are the functions
that have to happen,

851
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:10,909
and then which
chunks in your system

852
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:13,009
support or enable
what functions?

853
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,201
That's essentially what it is.

854
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,463
Yep.

855
00:41:16,463 --> 00:41:20,869
OK, anything else?

856
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:23,539
All right, question seven.

857
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:26,039
I think most of
you got this right.

858
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,670
We're going to get to
verification and validation

859
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:31,880
in a lot more detail, but
there is a distinction.

860
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:36,150
Some people use verification
and validation interchangeably.

861
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,849
They think it's the same.

862
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:39,529
It's different words
for the same thing.

863
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,810
That's not quite the case.

864
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:43,969
So here you've got
your verification loop

865
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,079
and your validation loop.

866
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,360


867
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:55,070
To put it very succinctly,
in verification,

868
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,900
you're answering the
question, did you

869
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,889
satisfy the requirements
as they were written?

870
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,389
That's the inner loop.

871
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,369
You've got your
requirements set,

872
00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:07,130
and then you do
verification, or inspection,

873
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,349
or there's different
ways of checking that.

874
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:12,440
But you check, do we
meet the requirements

875
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,200
as they were written?

876
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,230
That's the inner loop.

877
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,639
And then validation is the
outer loop where you say,

878
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:23,509
go back to the stakeholders,
and then you say the CONOPS,

879
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,450
right-- can we actually
execute the CONOPS--

880
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:29,419
and does the system
meet the expectations

881
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:30,320
of the stakeholders?

882
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,570
Does it deliver value to them?

883
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,590
And so it's quite
possible-- and there

884
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:38,300
are examples of systems that
actually successfully pass

885
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,200
verification.

886
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:42,079
You can check every
requirements, say, yup, yup,

887
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,739
yup, we can do that.

888
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,759
And then you demonstrate
the product, or the system,

889
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,690
to the stakeholders, and they
say, oh no, that's not at all

890
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:52,340
what we were looking for.

891
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,480
And then the question is,
well, did you change your mind?

892
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,510
You know, customer,
beneficiary--

893
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,660
did you change the mind from
today to when we started this

894
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:08,509
project, or was there some
error in translation going from

895
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,246
the stake--

896
00:43:09,246 --> 00:43:11,119
or the stakeholders
didn't change their mind.

897
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,480
You know, their use
cases, their CONOPS,

898
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,300
the value they want
to get from the system

899
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,310
hasn't changed since
you started the project,

900
00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:21,380
but there was some
error in translation

901
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,410
between those high level
stakeholder expectations

902
00:43:24,409 --> 00:43:25,989
and then the requirements.

903
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:28,039
No, maybe you missed
a requirement.

904
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,250
So that's the key idea
here between V and B,

905
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,409
and we'll talk a lot more about
this in the next few weeks.

906
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:38,420
All right, now comes
the one you've all

907
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,730
been waiting for, I know.

908
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,219
Question eight.

909
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:45,489
So here's the rocket equation.

910
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,519
Delta v, the change in velocity
of a rocket that you can

911
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,769
achieve is equal to gravity
times the specific impulse

912
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:57,769
times the log of
your initial mass--

913
00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:01,489
so this is your rocket
on the launch pad--

914
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:06,079
and over M i, which is the
final mass after the burn

915
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,119
has happened.

916
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,969
And so, one thing
that's important

917
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:13,339
is to define those masses.

918
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,760
And we got a lot of emails.

919
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,090
Right, [INAUDIBLE]?

920
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,829
Would you say this
was probably the most

921
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:20,922
emails we've gotten
all semester-- is

922
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:21,755
about this question?

923
00:44:21,755 --> 00:44:24,079
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

924
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,819
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
a bunch of questions

925
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,000
were just about the
definition of mass fraction.

926
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,619
What is the mass fraction?

927
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:32,839
And there are really two
different interpretations

928
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,524
of it.

929
00:44:33,523 --> 00:44:34,940
And it turned out
it didn't matter

930
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:37,700
which one you used because
the answer was the same.

931
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,559
So the one that I'm
showing you here

932
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:46,059
is that the initial mass
here is 1 plus alpha times M

933
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:49,320
f, your mass of fuel,
plus your payload.

934
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,850
So in this case, alpha
is the percentage

935
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:55,429
of the mass that
you're launching,

936
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:57,079
the fuel and the payload--

937
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:58,579
that's made up of
structure, which

938
00:44:58,579 --> 00:45:02,599
includes tankage, support
structure, the engines

939
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,219
themselves, et cetera.

940
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:07,819
The other definition you could
use which is equally valid,

941
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,090
you just have to define it,
is that alpha is only applied

942
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,950
to the fuel mass, right.

943
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:15,649
That you've got the
fuel, which in this case

944
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:18,829
is liquid oxygen,
liquid hydrogen.

945
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:21,500
And then you have your
tanks and your engine.

946
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,610
That's your mass fraction.

947
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,829
And then the
payload sits on top,

948
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,289
and there's no overhead
for carrying the payload.

949
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:30,829
And either way, it didn't
matter in this question

950
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,670
because the answer was the same.

951
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,440
So here the initial mass
is 1 plus alpha times

952
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,349
the mass of the fuel,
which is unknown,

953
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:44,779
and the mass of the payload,
which is given, 20 metric tons.

954
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,040
And then M1 is simply alpha
times mass of the fuel and mass

955
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:50,429
of the payload.

956
00:45:50,429 --> 00:45:53,779
So you can slightly rearrange--
there are different ways

957
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,210
of solving this problem.

958
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,440
A simple way is this.

959
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,659
You just basically
bring the constants

960
00:45:59,659 --> 00:46:01,409
over to the left side.

961
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:07,759
So delta V over g i s p, and
then basically, the right side

962
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,080
has to be larger than that.

963
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,670
So this is essentially your
1 plus alpha divided by alpha

964
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,880
because the M f plus
M p term falls out,

965
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,860
if you formulated that way.

966
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,079
So you can just plug
in the numbers that

967
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,969
were given in the
problem, and you

968
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:26,449
can see that the left hand side
does not match the right hand

969
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,500
side, right?

970
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,010
And the conclusion from this--

971
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,110
some of you tried to
solve for the fuel mass.

972
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,610
You know, there's
all kinds of ways.

973
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:39,480
And it's super frustrating,
and I know a lot of you

974
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,210
spent a lot of time trying
to solve this problem.

975
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:46,349
And no matter what way,
you get negative fuel mass.

976
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:47,789
You get all kinds
of weird things

977
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:49,259
trying to make this work.

978
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,550
The bottom line is
infeasible requirement.

979
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:59,150
It's not possible
with the required--

980
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,960
this is an example of an
infeasible requirement.

981
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,119
And I did this on
purpose to show you

982
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:13,869
that just because somebody
writes a requirement down,

983
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:16,639
it doesn't mean it's feasible.

984
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:20,960
So I think many of you got
this and were frustrated by it,

985
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,949
but I want to show you a real
project where this happened.

986
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:27,980
So you could then ask,
well, what would we

987
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,869
have to do to make it feasible?

988
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:33,409
So some of you said, well, maybe
we can achieve less delta V?

989
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:37,069
Or we need even better
propulsion, higher i s p.

990
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:41,809
Or-- which is maybe a little
bit more straightforward, what

991
00:47:41,809 --> 00:47:44,570
would be the mass fraction,
the alpha, that you would have

992
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,890
to achieve to make this work?

993
00:47:46,889 --> 00:47:50,359
And the answer is
somewhere around 8%,

994
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,970
depending on which definition
of mass fraction you used,

995
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:56,119
it's 7% to 8%.

996
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,170
So it means that if you want to
achieve single stage to orbit

997
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,570
flight with no staging, which
is the current way we do it,

998
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,950
you have to get the
mass fraction below 8%.

999
00:48:09,949 --> 00:48:14,819
And that includes everything,
the tanks, the support

1000
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,890
structure, the engines.

1001
00:48:16,889 --> 00:48:19,349
And that's really,
really, really tough.

1002
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:23,400
So I know you were frustrated
by this problem many of you,

1003
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,940
but let me tell you this story.

1004
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,710
Those folks were
really frustrated.

1005
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,280
So there was actually
a program here

1006
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:39,480
in the US in the late '90s
that tried to as a small scale

1007
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,079
technology demonstrator
demonstrate the technologies

1008
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,929
required to get to orbit
with a single stage vehicle.

1009
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:50,460
And that program was called the
X-33, run by Lockheed Martin--

1010
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,340
so, single stage to orbit,
reusable launch vehicle

1011
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,910
demonstrator.

1012
00:48:54,909 --> 00:49:00,710
The target mass, this is your M
0, total mass, 130 metric tons.

1013
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,990
The target mass
fraction was 0.1.

1014
00:49:03,989 --> 00:49:10,349
And fuel was just the same as
in this problem, LOX hydrogen.

1015
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:16,860
And the project basically
was canceled in 2001

1016
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:21,809
after about $1.3 billion
had been spent on it,

1017
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:25,349
and the thing that eventually
really led to the cancellation

1018
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:27,299
was the fuel tank.

1019
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,850
There was a composite
material fuel tank

1020
00:49:29,849 --> 00:49:33,739
that was embedded inside the
wing here, inside this body,

1021
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:35,909
has very complex shape.

1022
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:39,329
And those of you that know
about-- hydrogen atoms

1023
00:49:39,329 --> 00:49:40,469
are very, very small.

1024
00:49:40,469 --> 00:49:47,889
It's very tough to contain
hydrogen. It wants to leak.

1025
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:50,129
Its natural tendency
is to leak out.

1026
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,220
So this composite
fuel tank basically

1027
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:57,209
couldn't be built and
tested under pressure

1028
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,190
to be leak proof, and
they really tried.

1029
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,429
They spent a lot of money
on it, a lot of effort,

1030
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:03,659
couldn't be done.

1031
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:06,269
And so NASA
concluded, you know--

1032
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:11,699
and the goal was to achieve,
essentially, this mass fraction

1033
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,939
of 10% or below.

1034
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,720
And at that time, in the
late '90s, early 2000s,

1035
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,449
this was just not feasible
with the state of technology.

1036
00:50:22,449 --> 00:50:25,899
And so, think about
how frustrated--

1037
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,039
I know you spent an hour
or so trying to solve this,

1038
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,619
and we're not happy about it.

1039
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,039
But think about how they
felt. So the purpose of this--

1040
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,079
I think most of
this midterm exam

1041
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,226
was kind of a gift up
until this question.

1042
00:50:42,226 --> 00:50:44,309
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
about the mass fraction.

1043
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:48,549
I read the text over there,
and it says it's suborbital.

1044
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,289
So was the plan to reduce the
mass fraction even further

1045
00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:53,400
if this was a success?

1046
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
so this would not

1047
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,110
have achieved orbital velocity.

1048
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,579
So it's not a
complete one to one

1049
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:03,029
map because I gave you also
a higher delta V, right?

1050
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,820
I gave you 11
kilometers per second,

1051
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:11,010
which is escape velocity, and
you need to achieve about 7.5.

1052
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:13,590
But with drag and
gravity losses,

1053
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:16,900
you really needed
achieve about 9, 9.5.

1054
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:22,050
So it's not a one to one map,
but you sort of get the idea.

1055
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,300
Any question about this at EPFL?

1056
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:28,621


1057
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,369
Did you hear this?

1058
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:31,980
Was it was it fairly clear?

1059
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,619
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think everything

1060
00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:34,494
is clear on our side.

1061
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:35,327
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

1062
00:51:35,327 --> 00:51:36,130
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

1063
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,671
OLIVIER DE WECK:
All right, so if you

1064
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,099
want to read more
about the X-33,

1065
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,829
the Wikipedia article is
pretty good and there's a lot.

1066
00:51:42,829 --> 00:51:46,119
So just to say,
you know, I think

1067
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:47,690
we're going to try this again.

1068
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,730
I think there's going
to be new efforts.

1069
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:52,070
Composite materials
have come a long way--

1070
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:55,980
composite manufacturing,
15 years later,

1071
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:59,280
we might try this
again pretty soon.

1072
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,960
OK, question nine.

1073
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,500
So this was a little
bit of computation here.

1074
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,650
So the intent of
this question was

1075
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:11,840
for you to think about
competing objectives.

1076
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,309
Right, the Pareto frontiers,
we talked about this

1077
00:52:16,309 --> 00:52:18,029
in the concept selection.

1078
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:23,480
So this is the idea of, you're
designing a can or container

1079
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,280
for containing liquids.

1080
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,060
The shape is cylindrical
as shown in red.

1081
00:52:29,059 --> 00:52:31,579
And so the two things
you care about is volume.

1082
00:52:31,579 --> 00:52:34,880
How much liquid can you
carry inside the can?

1083
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,530
That's simply pi r-squared h--

1084
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,530
and then your
surface area, which

1085
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:44,780
you could say that's the
cost of the container, right.

1086
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:48,980
That's the amount of material
you need to use, is 2 pi r.

1087
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,840
Those at the top and bottom.

1088
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,490
And then 2 r pi h, which
is your circumference.

1089
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:59,750
And if you then plot four
different combinations

1090
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:04,760
of radius and height, what
is the volume and surface

1091
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,280
area, which is shown
in this plot here?

1092
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,990
Surface area as the y-axis
and volume on the x-axis.

1093
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:15,559


1094
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,570
The idea is you want
to maximize volume

1095
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:21,920
while minimizing
surface area by changing

1096
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,920
the radius and the height
subject to these constraints

1097
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,470
shown here, you should
have gotten something that

1098
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:29,569
looks like this blue curve.

1099
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:33,050
This is the Pareto frontier,
and the question was, well,

1100
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,150
where's the Utopia Point?

1101
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:38,660
The Utopia Point is
down to the lower right.

1102
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:41,329
Maybe you plotted it
differently, and that's fine.

1103
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:43,610
So you want as high
a volume as you

1104
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:50,099
can with minimum surface area,
but the best you can achieve--

1105
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:52,199
there's nothing in
this white space here.

1106
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:56,089
The best you can achieve is
this blue curve and above it.

1107
00:53:56,090 --> 00:54:00,750
And so then I'm plotting
to a small and a big one.

1108
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:04,159
So the Coca-Cola can is shown.

1109
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:06,719
The soda can is in
the lower left corner,

1110
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:09,199
and you can see it's pretty
much on the Pareto front.

1111
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,119
And then this is the standard
55 US gallon oil barrels.

1112
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:19,069
You know, if you go to like
a junkyard or a refinery,

1113
00:54:19,070 --> 00:54:22,430
you'll see these barrels of oil.

1114
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,081
Actually, it's not exactly
on the Pareto front,

1115
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:26,164
but it's very, very close.

1116
00:54:26,164 --> 00:54:28,849


1117
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,269
So that was the intent here.

1118
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:32,869
Any questions about this?

1119
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:33,542
Yes?

1120
00:54:33,543 --> 00:54:35,709
AUDIENCE: Are you trying
to determine whether or not

1121
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:39,951
the oil and the soda can
were on the Pareto front,

1122
00:54:39,952 --> 00:54:46,990
didn't that depend on how
you defined the assumptions?

1123
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,689
OLIVIER DE WECK: Not really,
one of the key assumptions

1124
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,860
that was given was that you
should assume zero thickness.

1125
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,120
Right, so it's just a
volume versus surface.

1126
00:54:56,119 --> 00:54:58,889
There's no actual thickness.

1127
00:54:58,889 --> 00:55:00,342
AUDIENCE: In terms of the--

1128
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:04,480


1129
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,590
I need to double check the--

1130
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:11,980
so when I looked at the
height of the different cans,

1131
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,710
were we supposed to leave
the problem as defined

1132
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:19,300
in terms of the original units?

1133
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:21,880
If you updated the units
as the maximum height

1134
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:26,530
to be within a more reasonable
range, not 2 meters versus 900

1135
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:32,140
millimeters, neither point
was on the Pareto front.

1136
00:55:32,139 --> 00:55:35,000
It just depended on how well you
defined your upper limit to be.

1137
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:35,389
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, I see.

1138
00:55:35,389 --> 00:55:36,730
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering if we were expected

1139
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,679
to maintain the
original upper limit,

1140
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:40,440
or if we were
allowed to change it.

1141
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,563
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, if
you change it, that's fine.

1142
00:55:42,563 --> 00:55:43,879
AUDIENCE: OK.

1143
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,880
OLIVIER DE WECK: The basic
idea of this question

1144
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:49,170
was to understand what
is a Pareto frontier.

1145
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:53,599


1146
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,909
And you know, to actually
think about something

1147
00:55:56,909 --> 00:56:00,429
we use almost every day.

1148
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:03,609
You know, we drink a soda
or something like that,

1149
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:07,240
and that shape is not a
randomly selected shape.

1150
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,159
It's actually based
on a trade off

1151
00:56:09,159 --> 00:56:15,250
between volume and efficiency--
right, volume and surface area.

1152
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:19,030
And here you go, here's where
it falls on the Pareto frontier.

1153
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:20,769
That's sort of the general idea.

1154
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:22,869
Well, we haven't
graded the exams yet,

1155
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:26,900
but I think we'll be fairly
generous on this question.

1156
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,840
OK, so then the last
one was really the--

1157
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,380
that's very recent happenings.

1158
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,510
If you read the article,
you realized, wow,

1159
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,562
there's kind of a
prehistory here.

1160
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:41,769
This is not just something
that happened a month ago.

1161
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:46,000
There's a long history leading
up to this emissions scandal,

1162
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:52,070
and the key table in the article
is this table shown here.

1163
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:56,230
It's essentially
these n o x numbers

1164
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:59,409
for emissions where you had
the different-- so these

1165
00:56:59,409 --> 00:57:00,519
are requirements.

1166
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:03,009
These are regulatory
requirements.

1167
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,820
And a big part of the story
is that the requirements--

1168
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,730
this is just for diesel
engines, the supplies

1169
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:15,610
for diesel engines in the US
and in Europe are different.

1170
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,670
And so you can see that
the limit is essentially

1171
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,750
the regulatory requirement.

1172
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,920
The dyno shown in green
here is demonstrate--

1173
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,220
this is verification.

1174
00:57:27,219 --> 00:57:30,219
Did you satisfy the
requirement as written?

1175
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:35,349
And you can argue that because
these vehicles had software

1176
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:38,319
in them, the purpose
of the software

1177
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,350
was to detect whether
or not the vehicle is

1178
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:43,239
being tested for emissions.

1179
00:57:43,239 --> 00:57:46,719
And the reason you can do it
is because the drive cycles

1180
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:48,159
are very tightly prescribed.

1181
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,159
So if the vehicle
is operating exactly

1182
00:57:51,159 --> 00:57:52,960
at the speeds and
velocities that

1183
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,829
correspond one to one to
those test drive cycles,

1184
00:57:56,829 --> 00:58:00,190
the software knew, ah, I'm
being tested for emissions.

1185
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:03,490


1186
00:58:03,489 --> 00:58:06,519
And you know, it's like
knowing that you're

1187
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,230
being watched as
a kid, and you're

1188
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,949
behaving because you know
you're being watched.

1189
00:58:11,949 --> 00:58:14,230
And then whenever you think
you're not being watched,

1190
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:15,699
you do something very different.

1191
00:58:15,699 --> 00:58:17,419
That's the general idea.

1192
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,829
So the green was
basically the dyno results

1193
00:58:20,829 --> 00:58:25,690
with the cheating, essentially,
with the software embedded.

1194
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:29,470
And then the West Virginia
University results,

1195
00:58:29,469 --> 00:58:31,959
which were this
independent testing,

1196
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:36,760
showed that the actual emissions
during regular operations

1197
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:41,780
were about 30 times
worse than this.

1198
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,670
And the trade off here is, of
course, with fuel efficiency.

1199
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,950
That's the big trade off.

1200
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:52,899
And so, we haven't read your
answers yet to this question,

1201
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,809
but it's extremely relevant
to system engineering

1202
00:58:55,809 --> 00:58:58,000
and in particular,
to the distinction

1203
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,900
between verification
and validation.

1204
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,200
So you can argue that
verification was passed here

1205
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:08,169
because it passes the dyno test.

1206
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,829
These are the regulatory
tests that are prescribed,

1207
00:59:11,829 --> 00:59:14,289
but it fails,
essentially, in the field

1208
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,119
to satisfy the requirements.

1209
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,849


1210
00:59:18,849 --> 00:59:22,389
And of course,
Volkswagen has admitted

1211
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:24,879
that they cheated in essence.

1212
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,050
But I'll be very interested to
see how the legal side of this

1213
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:34,920
works out because if you
interpret this very narrowly--

1214
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:39,130
and you cannot say that those
vehicles failed their emission

1215
00:59:39,130 --> 00:59:43,740
standard tests because they've
performed properly on the dyno.

1216
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:47,369
So to what extent are
these requirements,

1217
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:50,789
these environmental
requirements, which are very,

1218
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:52,949
in a sense, narrowly
defined in terms

1219
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:57,039
of how these requirements
are verified legally binding

1220
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:00,570
in terms of being able to
perform at those levels

1221
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:03,570
outside of the drive
cycle test cases

1222
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:05,100
that are prescribed by law?

1223
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:06,670
Did you see what I'm saying?

1224
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,889
So even though morally,
people generally

1225
01:00:10,889 --> 01:00:15,029
say that Volkswagen has cheated
because they're essentially

1226
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:17,580
reconfiguring the vehicle
depending on whether it's

1227
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:20,279
being tested officially or not.

1228
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,660
But from a legal
perspective, I'm

1229
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:27,599
not sure this is fully
done yet, so we'll

1230
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:31,710
have to see how the lawsuits
and all these things play out.

1231
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:33,059
Go ahead [INAUDIBLE].

1232
01:00:33,059 --> 01:00:34,949
AUDIENCE: Would you
would you say that,

1233
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:38,129
looking at it from the
regulators perspective,

1234
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,849
that they had set up
an expectation that

1235
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,659
didn't flow into a requirement?

1236
01:00:43,659 --> 01:00:48,399
And if it was a requirement,
it was unverifiable until WVU--

1237
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,769
it was an unverifiable
requirement in a sense.

1238
01:00:51,769 --> 01:00:53,519
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's
one way to say it.

1239
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,019
And you know, what is
the response to this?

1240
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,789
Well, one response could be
that a whole bunch of more test

1241
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,389
cases--

1242
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:02,909
you know, the
actual drive cycles

1243
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:04,440
that are going to
have to be tested

1244
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,579
are going to be much more--

1245
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,420


1246
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:09,059
I don't know.

1247
01:01:09,059 --> 01:01:09,559
We'll see.

1248
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:12,739
This is a big deal not
just for Volkswagon,

1249
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,759
but I think it's a very big deal
in the bigger picture of how

1250
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,390
do regulatory requirements
and standards apply

1251
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:25,960
to all kinds of products,
and how do you check them.

1252
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,309
Let's see real quick if
there is a question at EPFL.

1253
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:31,090
Any comments, questions?

1254
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:34,090


1255
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,400
AUDIENCE: Regulation,
actually, in Europe,

1256
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,920
it was forbidden and
explicitly forbidden

1257
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,296
to introduce a [? defect ?]
device in the car.

1258
01:01:42,295 --> 01:01:45,460
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, and
there's penalties for that,

1259
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,594
right?

1260
01:01:47,594 --> 01:01:48,710
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.

1261
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,226
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

1262
01:01:50,226 --> 01:01:52,815
Nathan, you had a point?

1263
01:01:52,815 --> 01:01:54,190
NATHAN: I was
wondering if you've

1264
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:58,599
seen any analysis on like WVU
doing tests on other vehicles

1265
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:01,217
to compare what they show on
their dyno results versus what

1266
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,550
they're admitting in real
life, even though it might not

1267
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,150
be this extreme.

1268
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,400
OLIVIER DE WECK: I don't know.

1269
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,733
I don't know what tests
they've done internally.

1270
01:02:08,733 --> 01:02:13,567
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it's
like a result [INAUDIBLE]----

1271
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:14,400
what do you call it?

1272
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,880
The test being so different from
the actual real life driving

1273
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,570
because nobody accelerates
from zero to 30 in 30 seconds.

1274
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:23,660
That's what they've
been testing.

1275
01:02:23,659 --> 01:02:25,289
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

1276
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:28,050
So there's a real,
real strong connection

1277
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:29,550
here with system engineering.

1278
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,000
And that was the purpose of this
question, is to sort of push--

1279
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,920
this question was not a gift.

1280
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,860
This sort of really
required you to dig in,

1281
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,420
and it was very timely, I think.

1282
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:42,360


1283
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,200
So cheat to meet requirements
failed validation.

1284
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:48,750
That's what I would
say as a quick summary.

1285
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:54,610
Any final questions,
comments about the online--

1286
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:57,052
the quiz, the midterm quiz?

1287
01:02:57,052 --> 01:03:00,760
OK, we've had we've had
our interactive discussion

1288
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,690
with the INCOSE
board of directors,

1289
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,599
so hopefully you enjoyed that.

1290
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:12,099
And we are now right on time
to hand it over to Octanis.

1291
01:03:12,099 --> 01:03:16,170
And Rafael will present this--

1292
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,500
Rafael Fabian Tychui.

1293
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,159
So essentially, you'll hear it's
about the design manufacturing

1294
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:24,279
and deployment of a rover
for extreme environment--

1295
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:26,330
Antarctica, in particular.

1296
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:29,829
And so, we look forward
to Rafael's presentation.

1297
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:31,869
And as you listen
to Rafael, think

1298
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,789
about what you
learned in this class

1299
01:03:33,789 --> 01:03:35,920
so far, how does it connect.

1300
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,950
And I think Rafael also tried
to gear the presentation a bit

1301
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:41,679
to the system
engineering concepts.

1302
01:03:41,679 --> 01:03:43,105
RAFAEL: So I'm Rafael.

1303
01:03:43,105 --> 01:03:46,389
I'm just going to
present myself quickly.

1304
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:51,639
I'm studying here at my master's
in nano and micro-electronics,

1305
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:54,339
and I'm speaking on
behalf of Octanis.

1306
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,670
So just in case, the image
quality wouldn't be perfect,

1307
01:03:57,670 --> 01:04:05,360
you can find this presentation
at MIT and on tiny.cc/octanis

1308
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,370
just to see the picture.

1309
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:10,609
And well, Octanis
is an association

1310
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:13,730
that was just recently founded.

1311
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,889
We have certain key values.

1312
01:04:15,889 --> 01:04:19,339


1313
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,329
So fascination is one of them.

1314
01:04:21,329 --> 01:04:26,599
We set in-shop goals and then
get very passionate about this.

1315
01:04:26,599 --> 01:04:29,509
We want to build
affordable products,

1316
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:34,260
so we use open source software,
we 3D print parts, and so on.

1317
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:37,040
We use off-the-shelf components.

1318
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,279
And we want to do open design,
so we share our code on GitHub.

1319
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,410
We share our mechanical
designs to the community.

1320
01:04:46,409 --> 01:04:49,849
And one point is also
education, so we, ourselves,

1321
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:53,420
want to learn from
what we're doing

1322
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:56,059
and want to make others
benefit from our learning,

1323
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,869
and try to help them, as
well, with their projects.

1324
01:04:59,869 --> 01:05:05,630
And how we tackle things is kind
of summarized in this statement

1325
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:11,210
from Tom Chi from Google X.
So we minimise the time to try

1326
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:15,750
things and maximize
the time of learning.

1327
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:19,500
That means we iterate very fast.

1328
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:20,880
We do a prototype very fast.

1329
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,660
We go on with the
idea, with a prototype,

1330
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:26,359
with a sketch, a
design, and so on.

1331
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,250
And we try it.

1332
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,920
If you fail, just move,
try the next thing.

1333
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,250
And you know, that's
basically how it is.

1334
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:40,969
And the first project that just
emerged out of this procedure

1335
01:05:40,969 --> 01:05:45,750
is Octanis I, so that's what
I'm going to talk about today.

1336
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:48,570
So maybe quickly
about the team--

1337
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:51,920
so the rule 7 plus minus 1--

1338
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,840
plus minus 2 applies
here as well.

1339
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,240
So we are eight members
now working on that rover--

1340
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:03,719
from different fields,
from engineering, physics,

1341
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,559
life science as well.

1342
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,949
And the story began actually
when Sam was here as well.

1343
01:06:10,949 --> 01:06:13,359
For the QHN, just in case.

1344
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:17,329
And Anna found about this
competition or that call

1345
01:06:17,329 --> 01:06:22,610
from Ecuador that
was about building--

1346
01:06:22,610 --> 01:06:28,160
or sending a student project,
or whatever, to Antarctica.

1347
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,619
And they thought, well,
let's [INAUDIBLE] take

1348
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:35,739
this challenge, and we're going
to put a rover on a weather

1349
01:06:35,739 --> 01:06:39,609
balloon, send it from South
America to Antarctica,

1350
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:43,370
deploy it there, let it
drive around for one summer.

1351
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:45,599
And let's see what happens.

1352
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,349
And well, they
started immediately

1353
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:51,380
with doing simulations.

1354
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:55,829
There's the online tool that
allows to kind of predict

1355
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:59,889
the optimal time for a
trajectory in the air, so

1356
01:06:59,889 --> 01:07:02,389
a particle or an
object in the air that

1357
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:05,299
will have a desired trajectory.

1358
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:08,630
And you can kind of find out
the best moment in the year

1359
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,809
to do this.

1360
01:07:09,809 --> 01:07:13,500
And it was actually
demonstrated, kind of,

1361
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:19,239
to show that this is possible
to have this trajectory.

1362
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:22,459
Well, I heard about this
later, and they asked me

1363
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:25,630
if I could do the
electronics design of this--

1364
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:27,559
so the main board and so on.

1365
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:30,449
And I was fascinated
by the project,

1366
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:32,951
so I joined immediately,
but at the same time,

1367
01:07:32,952 --> 01:07:35,410
I saw all the challenges that
we're going to have to solve.

1368
01:07:35,409 --> 01:07:38,750
So I thought about all
the problems we have.

1369
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,599
For instance, what happens if we
lose the balloon in the ocean?

1370
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:46,039
What happens if we run out
of power and the temperature

1371
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:48,029
drops--

1372
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:53,130
if an arm breaks, and you
know, we cannot get up anymore?

1373
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:55,849
But at some point,
I just realized

1374
01:07:55,849 --> 01:08:00,380
that, well, all we do is
we just send a balloon

1375
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:03,019
with the rover to
Antarctica, and we're

1376
01:08:03,019 --> 01:08:05,750
going to deploy it there,
and it will drive it down.

1377
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,489
And I think that
that's something

1378
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:10,009
we saw also in this
class because I'm

1379
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:15,800
following this class passively
on WebEx and with the videos.

1380
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:20,640
So yeah, the thing
that you have to see

1381
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:22,970
is the big picture as a
system engineer, right.

1382
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:25,310
You see the whole
mission, and you

1383
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,202
don't care about the
details at this level.

1384
01:08:29,202 --> 01:08:30,909
But you're going to
decompose the problem

1385
01:08:30,909 --> 01:08:34,159
into specific sub-problems
and have groups of people

1386
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,858
working on this, and that's it.

1387
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,579
So it just looked easy to me.

1388
01:08:40,579 --> 01:08:42,979
In the end, we're
just going to do it,

1389
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:45,380
and we started with
the first problem.

1390
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,300
And just to give
you an idea, that's

1391
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,909
one of our last prototypes.

1392
01:08:48,909 --> 01:08:52,800
So that's how the rover
is going to look like.

1393
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:58,670
We see two struts with wheels
on each side, solar panels

1394
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:03,789
and 3D printed parts for 3D
printed wheels and struts.

1395
01:09:03,789 --> 01:09:08,050
And you see the
balloon in our logo.

1396
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:10,949
And we're not going to
do the balloon right now,

1397
01:09:10,948 --> 01:09:14,989
but the first mission will
just be the rover itself.

1398
01:09:14,989 --> 01:09:18,380
And that slide basically
summarizes the goal.

1399
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:22,689
So the mission of Octanis I is
to build a reusable autonomous

1400
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:27,279
solar powered and open source
for outdoors, and in this case,

1401
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:31,819
for an extreme environment
like Antarctica.

1402
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:34,420
So let's go down
to V-model, right.

1403
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,369
We'll start with the
stakeholder analysis.

1404
01:09:37,369 --> 01:09:40,430
In our case, it's pretty simple.

1405
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:44,950
It's the Antarctic
Institute from Ecuador,

1406
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:48,519
which we contacted and
showed our project,

1407
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:53,410
and they were pretty happy about
this, and I want to learn more.

1408
01:09:53,409 --> 01:09:54,880
So we presented our project.

1409
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,670
We sent in a proposal
and are right now,

1410
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:01,409
writing the final
documents for them.

1411
01:10:01,409 --> 01:10:03,399
And what we basically
have to provide

1412
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:08,979
is just the goals of the mission
and the scientific findings

1413
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:11,079
we're going to have, so
we will produce a paper

1414
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:16,630
at the end of this and
write about what we found.

1415
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:21,159
And further down, the V-models,
will be the requirements.

1416
01:10:21,159 --> 01:10:25,800
So we can look at some
Shall requirements.

1417
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,949
So the power system of the
rover shall provide 10 watts

1418
01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:35,539
on average, so we
figured that out after

1419
01:10:35,539 --> 01:10:36,939
like riding on a power budget.

1420
01:10:36,939 --> 01:10:42,079
Should We want to drive around
that will cost that much power,

1421
01:10:42,079 --> 01:10:47,260
and that will be that much
time during the day, and so on.

1422
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:50,655
So that was the number
we came up with.

1423
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:53,019
Oh, and the interior
temperature shall not

1424
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:56,890
drop below minus
20 degrees Celsius,

1425
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,400
so about 10 Fahrenheit.

1426
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:06,159
That's basically the point where
you cannot charge the battery

1427
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:12,109
any more because of the
chemical composition of it.

1428
01:11:12,109 --> 01:11:13,809
So standard batteries,
you shouldn't

1429
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:16,270
go below minus 10 degrees.

1430
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,840
That's really a hard
requirement we have to provide.

1431
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,050
The total weight shall
not exceed 2.5 kilograms.

1432
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:26,770
Basically, we look already for
the mission, for the balloons--

1433
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:30,730
so it shouldn't be too
expensive to put the helium--

1434
01:11:30,729 --> 01:11:33,009
like, to buy the
helium and so on.

1435
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:36,480
And the rover shall be
able to communicate to us

1436
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:38,089
from any point of the Earth.

1437
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:42,819
For that, they basically
used the Iridium Network,

1438
01:11:42,819 --> 01:11:47,139
which you can pay like
for a text message.

1439
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:51,250
You can pay something and
you can send your message

1440
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,350
from any point as well.

1441
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,630
There's a bunch of satellites
covering the whole planet

1442
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,850
basically.

1443
01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:02,260
And [INAUDIBLE] managed to climb
the slope, a certain slope.

1444
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:08,050
That's just to assure
that we can not just

1445
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,027
drive on flat terrain.

1446
01:12:10,027 --> 01:12:11,609
There's also some
should requirements.

1447
01:12:11,609 --> 01:12:13,371
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Rafael, quick question.

1448
01:12:13,371 --> 01:12:13,869
RAFAEL: Yes?

1449
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:16,149
OLIVIER DE WECK: Where did
the 14 degrees come from?

1450
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:19,019
Did you do like a terrain
analysis on Antarctica,

1451
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:22,870
or how did you come up with
14 degrees as the requirement

1452
01:12:22,869 --> 01:12:26,670
for this hill climbing?

1453
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:29,940
RAFAEL: We basically
looked at the motors

1454
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:33,989
we would have in mind to
take, and then figured out

1455
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,939
that that's basically
what they can do.

1456
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,116
And we tested it.

1457
01:12:37,117 --> 01:12:38,699
So I'm going to talk
about this later.

1458
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:45,449
We didn't do this up, down only,
but we looked at what we have

1459
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:46,399
and what we can do.

1460
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:47,899
And that's what we
figured out would

1461
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:51,420
be a reasonable kind of choice,
but yeah, good question.

1462
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:54,716


1463
01:12:54,716 --> 01:13:00,409
So the should requirements
cover reproducibility,

1464
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:03,675
so any non-expert should
also be able to build

1465
01:13:03,675 --> 01:13:09,570
this rover without being
an engineer user as well.

1466
01:13:09,569 --> 01:13:12,779
The cost should
stay below $1,000,

1467
01:13:12,779 --> 01:13:16,710
so the material costs only,
of course, not the R&D.

1468
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:19,840
The range should be
around 1 kilometers a day.

1469
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,310
That's kind in the order of
magnitude of the Curiosity

1470
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,150
Rover, so we're not stressed.

1471
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:27,359
We don't have to go fast.

1472
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:33,029
We have weeks or months to be
there, so one kilometer per day

1473
01:13:33,029 --> 01:13:35,509
is just fine.

1474
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,810
There should be for
a scientific payload.

1475
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:42,180
Room means physical
space and also

1476
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:46,079
certain conditions like
temperature, humidity inside,

1477
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:48,539
depending on the experiment.

1478
01:13:48,539 --> 01:13:51,739
And well, it should survive
one Antarctic summer,

1479
01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:54,389
so that implies
also the conditions

1480
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:59,500
that we have there like
the weather and the sun,

1481
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,800
the radiation, and so on.

1482
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,210
So with all of this done,
we had our first diagram,

1483
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:07,789
so pardon the [INAUDIBLE].

1484
01:14:07,789 --> 01:14:11,170
Our representation is not
what we learned in this class,

1485
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,840
but that's what we had, right?

1486
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,650
So this graph is mostly
on the electronics.

1487
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:18,399
It's focused.

1488
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:21,378
There's a main
board in the middle.

1489
01:14:21,378 --> 01:14:22,920
I'm not sure if you
see that clearly,

1490
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:27,090
but a main board with a
bunch of sensors up here,

1491
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:32,199
and also a camera, and RF
modules for communications,

1492
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:35,039
and maxillary board for
the scientific payload,

1493
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:36,336
for instance.

1494
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:42,449
And we kept going with this,
and we basically designed a PCB

1495
01:14:42,449 --> 01:14:43,619
with all these components.

1496
01:14:43,619 --> 01:14:46,399
And most of it worked as well.

1497
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:50,199
We also thought about
the mechanics of course.

1498
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:56,309
This design is inspired
from a NASA project that

1499
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:59,400
was, in the end,
abandoned because it was

1500
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:02,289
too high in cost, but still--

1501
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:05,609
this manner of
[INAUDIBLE] was kind

1502
01:15:05,609 --> 01:15:08,579
of having the same
structure-- so two struts

1503
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:12,569
that would allow to flip the
rover entirely around if it

1504
01:15:12,569 --> 01:15:16,949
gets clipped by the wind,
and also put it more flat

1505
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:19,920
or align it to the
sun, so that it

1506
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,989
gets the maximum of the energy.

1507
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:25,519
And yeah, that's what we had.

1508
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,200
And we went out with
our first prototype.

1509
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:30,210
It's pretty cute, right?

1510
01:15:30,210 --> 01:15:33,390
We went to Sweden with that.

1511
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:37,710
It has a bunch of cheap Chinese
solar cells from the eBay.

1512
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:41,319
And the rules and everything
are already 3D printed.

1513
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:43,519
Printed It has our
first main board,

1514
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:46,860
and it was just capable of
driving around somewhere

1515
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:48,799
on the snow.

1516
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,659
And we [INAUDIBLE] testing
the parachute, so [INAUDIBLE]

1517
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:53,130
came back.

1518
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:56,819
And it worked a few
times, but in the end,

1519
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:01,389
it had kind of an incident.

1520
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:06,050
So we could really test it
and analyze what happened,

1521
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:09,170
and so really what
we can improve

1522
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:13,170
for the further iterations.

1523
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,340
And I stopped before
at the remodel.

1524
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:18,420
I want to go down a bit
deeper there and show everyone

1525
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,230
a few examples.

1526
01:16:19,229 --> 01:16:21,935
So that that's the
electoral power system.

1527
01:16:21,935 --> 01:16:25,920
And I want to summarize again,
that the relevant requirements

1528
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,399
that are 10 watts on average
that should be produced

1529
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:34,619
and the temperature that should
be held inside the rover.

1530
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:39,029
So we have this choice of
having the small, one chip

1531
01:16:39,029 --> 01:16:42,899
solution on the left.

1532
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:43,739
That was cheap.

1533
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:45,155
It was easy.

1534
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:48,192
It was reliable.

1535
01:16:48,192 --> 01:16:51,000
Or we could have that
more complex system

1536
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,979
where we have more flexibility.

1537
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:59,489
We have, actually, more power
output than the small chip,

1538
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:04,409
and it's basically adaptable
to what we need exactly.

1539
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:08,369
And we, in the end,
went for the second--

1540
01:17:08,369 --> 01:17:14,099
for the right option mainly
because of the power output

1541
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:16,000
because the 10 wants imply--

1542
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:21,329
a few amps, actually, of output
and a solar powered input

1543
01:17:21,329 --> 01:17:22,930
that would have to be managed.

1544
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:25,200
And that's just not
possible for the small chip

1545
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:28,079
we had in our first
prototype actually.

1546
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:31,769
So we had a concept
that was inspired

1547
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:35,120
from the Swiss [? Cube ?]
Satellite because I remember

1548
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,559
going to work there
for his masterpiece,

1549
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,690
and he got inspired from
his concept of having

1550
01:17:42,689 --> 01:17:47,000
this particular
architecture that implies

1551
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,250
having a shared VSS buss.

1552
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:54,800
So you had your 3 volts
that was feed [INAUDIBLE]

1553
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,539
to your system, and
directly to that,

1554
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,390
connected to solar
panels and the battery.

1555
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:04,936
And if the power bus would
drop below the 3.3 volts,

1556
01:18:04,935 --> 01:18:08,099
it will get regulated or
stabilized by discharging

1557
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:12,990
the battery or by solar power,
but you cannot kind of steer

1558
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:13,489
this.

1559
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:16,699
And if it will be too
high then 3.3 volts,

1560
01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:20,590
it will [INAUDIBLE] it again
with charging the battery.

1561
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:23,310
And that was basically
the main concept

1562
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:27,060
that he implemented then.

1563
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:30,810
And the next steps,
if you go further,

1564
01:18:30,810 --> 01:18:33,386
would be the component
selection, the PCB design,

1565
01:18:33,386 --> 01:18:33,885
right.

1566
01:18:33,885 --> 01:18:36,460
The [INAUDIBLE]
materials-- right now,

1567
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,510
we're programming the framework.

1568
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:41,400
And testing, that's
also ongoing.

1569
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:44,819
And at the same time,
optimized for having cheaper

1570
01:18:44,819 --> 01:18:47,569
components-- components
with the smaller footprint,

1571
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:52,099
so you save space on
your PCB and so on.

1572
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:55,060
So that would be really at
the bottom of the [INAUDIBLE]

1573
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:57,370
right now.

1574
01:18:57,369 --> 01:19:01,800
Also, maybe, a good example
that shows this trade space

1575
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,699
exploration would be
the mechanical design.

1576
01:19:06,699 --> 01:19:09,934
So the driving mechanism,
that could be--

1577
01:19:09,934 --> 01:19:11,850
well, wheels like we had
it, but it could also

1578
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:18,539
be like caterpillar or any
other kind of mechanism.

1579
01:19:18,539 --> 01:19:23,579
The motors could be cheap
ones from eBay for $3 a piece

1580
01:19:23,579 --> 01:19:27,015
or like high end Maxon motors
we all love here in Switzerland,

1581
01:19:27,015 --> 01:19:29,149
right?

1582
01:19:29,149 --> 01:19:33,319
And well, you could
print that with a 3D

1583
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:35,189
printer, the structure.

1584
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:37,919
Even the gears, you
can print them out,

1585
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,795
actually, yourself,
with plastic.

1586
01:19:39,795 --> 01:19:41,114
It works actually.

1587
01:19:41,114 --> 01:19:43,349
Or you could select
metallic parts.

1588
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,910
We have also a few--

1589
01:19:44,909 --> 01:19:48,930
like, the worm guy for instance,
we need to take a metallic one.

1590
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,190


1591
01:19:52,189 --> 01:19:56,339
In the end, we had a combination
of all of these things.

1592
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,930
So we had the struts.

1593
01:19:57,930 --> 01:20:01,753
We also have the Maxon motors
that were sponsored luckily,

1594
01:20:01,752 --> 01:20:04,079
so the price isn't too high--

1595
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:08,789
and the metallic worm guy,
as I said, 3D printed struts,

1596
01:20:08,789 --> 01:20:11,082
3D printed wheels.

1597
01:20:11,082 --> 01:20:13,430
And in the end, there was
a trade off between costs,

1598
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:18,510
reproducibility, reliability,
the range of the robot as well,

1599
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:22,750
and the maximum slopes
you could do as well.

1600
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:27,260
So what we could have
done was this [INAUDIBLE]

1601
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:32,369
metrics, or the further points,
to optimize this design,

1602
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:36,539
but we figured out that
kind of without this,

1603
01:20:36,539 --> 01:20:39,949
we just decided, kind of, to
take one of these options,

1604
01:20:39,949 --> 01:20:40,449
I think.

1605
01:20:40,449 --> 01:20:43,109


1606
01:20:43,109 --> 01:20:47,069
So that was what we learned
from the prototype one.

1607
01:20:47,069 --> 01:20:49,889
And then the second one,
we had a few adaptions.

1608
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:52,750
So we changed our
main microcontroller.

1609
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:57,034
We changed the RF module
to a standard that

1610
01:20:57,034 --> 01:20:59,369
is now emerging called LoRa.

1611
01:20:59,369 --> 01:21:02,449
And we also added that
power system I talked about.

1612
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:07,500
But mainly, it remained
the same on that diagram.

1613
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,920
And just to show
you how we actually

1614
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:15,114
are looking at that goal that
we are having the rover that

1615
01:21:15,114 --> 01:21:17,630
is reproducible by someone.

1616
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:19,449
This looks pretty much
like a kit, right?

1617
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:22,619
Its all 3D printed parts.

1618
01:21:22,619 --> 01:21:26,300
You can just assemble them,
the solar cells and you

1619
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:29,130
know, the structure
to build the body.

1620
01:21:29,130 --> 01:21:35,090
And looking at this, you might
see that it's not many parts.

1621
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:39,300
It's almost, as we
discussed, within the range

1622
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:43,570
of a non-complex systems that
could be managed by one person.

1623
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:47,969
But in the end, for instance,
the solar panels that are,

1624
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,390
again, decomposable
in separate parts.

1625
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:56,010
We manufactured them ourselves
taking blemished cells

1626
01:21:56,010 --> 01:21:58,989
from eBay, putting
them into arrays,

1627
01:21:58,989 --> 01:22:00,550
soldering the connection.

1628
01:22:00,550 --> 01:22:03,930
So in the end, you have a
lot of individual parts--

1629
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:06,320
also, all the parts
on the PCB and so on,

1630
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:11,329
so it quickly explodes in size.

1631
01:22:11,329 --> 01:22:13,269
The second prototype
had more power

1632
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:15,610
because of the solar cells--

1633
01:22:15,609 --> 01:22:17,309
and also improved
mechanical design,

1634
01:22:17,310 --> 01:22:21,539
so that the wheels were
lighter and more stable--

1635
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:22,949
also, the struts and so on.

1636
01:22:22,949 --> 01:22:25,889
And we tested that again,
this summer, on a glacier

1637
01:22:25,890 --> 01:22:28,800
here in Switzerland.

1638
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,000
And to wrap that all
up, just a few points,

1639
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,180
we didn't maybe do
like an industry

1640
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:40,039
or like we saw it in this class.

1641
01:22:40,039 --> 01:22:43,119
So as I talked earlier
about this before,

1642
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:46,140
we mainly had this
bottom up approach.

1643
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:48,880
We also had a global
vision, at first,

1644
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,819
to define the subsystems and
so on, but we didn't strictly

1645
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:59,340
iterate from the top of
the model to down part

1646
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,610
because sometimes we just
saw that great components--

1647
01:23:02,609 --> 01:23:04,835
for instance, the RF module--

1648
01:23:04,835 --> 01:23:08,779
that will provide us with all
a lower power consumption,

1649
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:10,920
a higher range, and
was just perfectly

1650
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:14,130
adaptive for our mission.

1651
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:17,699
So we are stuck with this
one, and integrated it

1652
01:23:17,699 --> 01:23:20,489
in the design, and built
the rest of the components

1653
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:22,329
around it.

1654
01:23:22,329 --> 01:23:25,774
There's also, of course-- we
didn't have like formal PDR

1655
01:23:25,774 --> 01:23:30,960
or CDR because we were a small
team and also because we're not

1656
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:31,840
doing this--

1657
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,000
let's say, as a main--

1658
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,630
well, yes, it is kind
of a main occupation,

1659
01:23:36,630 --> 01:23:40,970
but we're still studying
next to it [INAUDIBLE]..

1660
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:46,600
Also, we may change our
design decision on the way,

1661
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,510
not like the complete design
but minor, minor things of it.

1662
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:54,720
And we mainly focus
on this approach

1663
01:23:54,720 --> 01:24:01,050
to do rapid prototyping and do
a lot of iterations on one thing

1664
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:04,260
instead of making
first concept studies,

1665
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:06,900
and then select the
best one, and only then

1666
01:24:06,899 --> 01:24:12,750
really go to build
it, and cut metal--

1667
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:15,359
that's [INAUDIBLE].

1668
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:18,359
That we can do
because we basically

1669
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:22,019
have all these low cost
components, so it doesn't cost

1670
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,420
us a lot to build one
prototype because everything

1671
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:29,000
is 3D printed,
everything is electronics

1672
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,920
that is pretty cheaply
doable right now.

1673
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,930
And yeah, we can do this.

1674
01:24:37,930 --> 01:24:41,760
And to motivate us, or
to give us some pressure,

1675
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,619
we set these
artificial deadlines.

1676
01:24:43,619 --> 01:24:47,319
So we put the design
freezes in our calendar.

1677
01:24:47,319 --> 01:24:49,649
So from this point
on, we will not

1678
01:24:49,649 --> 01:24:52,949
change these parts of
the systems any more.

1679
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:57,329
That allows us to kind
of move on on this

1680
01:24:57,329 --> 01:25:00,809
and get some things
custom, for granted,

1681
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,720
so we don't have to adapt
other things because something

1682
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:05,730
else changed again.

1683
01:25:05,729 --> 01:25:08,639
And we have these field
tests like I talked about

1684
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:11,220
in Sweden and on the
glaciers, so that gives us

1685
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,810
kind of pressure as well.

1686
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:17,590
Because I remember before
the week in Sweden,

1687
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:22,560
we basically relayed in the
lab, and we spent the night

1688
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,700
to keep the 3D printer running.

1689
01:25:26,699 --> 01:25:30,029
And as soon as the part was
done, put the next one on,

1690
01:25:30,029 --> 01:25:34,630
and you know, changing our--

1691
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:38,400
being there in shifts
to keep it running.

1692
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,429
And that was a great experience
because you really have that

1693
01:25:41,430 --> 01:25:44,039
thing to be done because
it cannot be 3D printed

1694
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:45,271
in [INAUDIBLE] method.

1695
01:25:45,271 --> 01:25:46,979
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Rafael, so why don't you

1696
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:49,439
go one more minute
because we want

1697
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:52,359
to do a couple of
questions also, yeah?

1698
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:55,339
RAFAEL: Yeah, I'm
almost done actually.

1699
01:25:55,340 --> 01:26:00,039
So how we structure all this
data is basically on the Wiki.

1700
01:26:00,039 --> 01:26:04,260
That allows you to go deeper
into the different parts,

1701
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:07,430
and we use Trello for
defining milestones.

1702
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:08,980
It's an online tool--

1703
01:26:08,979 --> 01:26:10,799
can use for free.

1704
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,260
And the major
systems engineering

1705
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:17,789
challenges I saw here was
especially the time management,

1706
01:26:17,789 --> 01:26:20,729
and human factor as well
because you kind of need

1707
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:23,317
to have this boundary
between someone who's

1708
01:26:23,317 --> 01:26:24,899
doing the mechanical
design, someone's

1709
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:27,359
who is doing the
electronics design.

1710
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,000
Don't cross the boundary
because that person

1711
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,264
is an expert in his field.

1712
01:26:32,264 --> 01:26:33,930
And if you just come
up with something--

1713
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:35,965
hey, why don't you
do this with this?

1714
01:26:35,965 --> 01:26:37,590
First of all, it will
annoy the person.

1715
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:40,739
And second of all
it's like, that person

1716
01:26:40,739 --> 01:26:42,399
has made a lot of
thought in this,

1717
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:46,439
and you shouldn't just
come with your thing

1718
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:49,149
you have done in five minutes.

1719
01:26:49,149 --> 01:26:50,149
Ask the right questions.

1720
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:54,682
And [INAUDIBLE] thought,
it's difficult to just put

1721
01:26:54,682 --> 01:26:57,449
the design on paper
for components

1722
01:26:57,449 --> 01:27:00,199
you haven't even tested before.

1723
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:06,069
So just like a few
seconds left for this.

1724
01:27:06,069 --> 01:27:07,559
We go out to
[INAUDIBLE] as well.

1725
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:10,718
So we're going to test
this rover in February

1726
01:27:10,717 --> 01:27:14,099
in Antarctica.

1727
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,960
We can only send
one person to there,

1728
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:19,489
so we have this
agreement within 30 days.

1729
01:27:19,489 --> 01:27:24,630
And they allowed us to send
one person in February 2016

1730
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:29,190
to Antarctica, and it's none
of us who's going to go.

1731
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:32,329
But it might be someone
or someone else.

1732
01:27:32,329 --> 01:27:36,659
And you have that chance to go
there, all expenses covered,

1733
01:27:36,659 --> 01:27:40,590
and you will be there
as a field scientist,

1734
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:44,400
collaborate with the bases,
and basically produce

1735
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:46,259
a paper at the end of this.

1736
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:50,630
If you're interested,
octanis.org/apply.

1737
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:52,789
You'll find all the
information's there.

1738
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:56,369
And the deadline is
tomorrow actually.

1739
01:27:56,369 --> 01:27:58,800
OLIVIER DE WECK: All
right, just in time.

1740
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:03,400
Thank you, let's
give Rafael a hand.

1741
01:28:03,399 --> 01:28:07,719
OK, so we have like three to
four minutes for questions,

1742
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:10,800
so let's start with
questions at EPFL

1743
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,572
and then one question--
we'll go back and forth.

1744
01:28:13,572 --> 01:28:17,765


1745
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:19,690
AUDIENCE: And just maybe
a critical question,

1746
01:28:19,689 --> 01:28:24,269
why did you choose to switch
from your first communication

1747
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:25,400
[INAUDIBLE] after?

1748
01:28:25,399 --> 01:28:28,353


1749
01:28:28,354 --> 01:28:30,020
RAFAEL: [INAUDIBLE]
thing we had before?

1750
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:33,220
AUDIENCE: Yes, and
why did you change?

1751
01:28:33,220 --> 01:28:37,270
RAFAEL: Before we had
kind of a DIY component

1752
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:41,380
that was called AHX 1 that
there you basically had

1753
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:43,900
to modulate the
signal that you're

1754
01:28:43,899 --> 01:28:47,170
going to transmit yourself, and
it was just way too complex.

1755
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:50,829
The new component, you can
just send zero commands

1756
01:28:50,829 --> 01:28:54,550
by [INAUDIBLE],, and it
will just do its job.

1757
01:28:54,550 --> 01:29:00,320
And it's higher range, as well,
and lower power consumption.

1758
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,920
AUDIENCE: And how you shoot
to have a [INAUDIBLE]??

1759
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,730
RAFAEL: Oh, sorry,
yeah, that component's

1760
01:29:06,729 --> 01:29:10,659
only to communicate from
the rover to the base,

1761
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:13,460
so that will be
like 20 kilometers.

1762
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:19,131
For the coverage to the land,
we'll use the Iridium network.

1763
01:29:19,131 --> 01:29:21,365
Any questions at MIT?

1764
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:22,239
OLIVIER DE WECK: Sam?

1765
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:25,010


1766
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,710
SAM: This is really
interesting, thanks.

1767
01:29:26,710 --> 01:29:28,510
So I was wondering,
with your focus

1768
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:32,860
on openness and
affordability, I guess, do

1769
01:29:32,859 --> 01:29:37,059
you foresee any participation
by the public in terms

1770
01:29:37,060 --> 01:29:42,280
of like prototyping and testing
or even improving the design--

1771
01:29:42,279 --> 01:29:45,539
and/or data analysis?

1772
01:29:45,539 --> 01:29:48,130
RAFAEL: Yeah, well,
we're completely open,

1773
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:51,880
so we are based here in
[INAUDIBLE] in a place

1774
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,574
called [INAUDIBLE] hacker
space, maker space,

1775
01:29:55,574 --> 01:29:57,065
whatever you want to call it.

1776
01:29:57,065 --> 01:30:01,149
We have open nights over
Wednesdays, so anyone can come.

1777
01:30:01,149 --> 01:30:04,329
And all our design is
on GitHub, so if there's

1778
01:30:04,329 --> 01:30:06,207
going to be remote
collaborations,

1779
01:30:06,207 --> 01:30:07,539
we would really appreciate that.

1780
01:30:07,539 --> 01:30:09,810
So anyone who is
interested in the project,

1781
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:13,500
you can go on our
website, octanis.org/join,

1782
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:19,926
and we [INAUDIBLE] to
collaborate, of course.

1783
01:30:19,926 --> 01:30:21,899
Does that answer your question?

1784
01:30:21,899 --> 01:30:23,689
SAM: Yes, thank you.

1785
01:30:23,689 --> 01:30:25,689
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'd like
to ask you a question.

1786
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:28,449
So you know, I think one of
the things that was quite--

1787
01:30:28,449 --> 01:30:30,849
first of all, the enthusiasm
that you guys have

1788
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,686
is infectious.

1789
01:30:32,685 --> 01:30:34,059
It's very clear
you guys are very

1790
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:38,420
passionate about this mission,
and it's very exciting.

1791
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:40,449
The fact that you didn't
do these milestones,

1792
01:30:40,449 --> 01:30:42,609
you didn't do a
formal PDR or CDR,

1793
01:30:42,609 --> 01:30:45,939
but you're doing essentially,
kind of spiral development.

1794
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:47,979
So two questions,
one is how many

1795
01:30:47,979 --> 01:30:50,769
more spirals do you think
you'll be able to do before you

1796
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:53,680
actually deploy the rover?

1797
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,520
Because you said
you did two spirals.

1798
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:57,310
It sounds like so far.

1799
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:58,690
So how many more spirals?

1800
01:30:58,689 --> 01:31:04,049
And how will you know whether
your mission was successful

1801
01:31:04,050 --> 01:31:04,630
or not?

1802
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:07,890
So what are the success
criteria in the end?

1803
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:12,780
When you look back at
the actual operation,

1804
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:17,259
how will you decide whether
you were successful or not?

1805
01:31:17,260 --> 01:31:18,176
RAFAEL: OK, thank you.

1806
01:31:18,176 --> 01:31:22,580
So for the first one,
we had our design freeze

1807
01:31:22,579 --> 01:31:25,143
for the last iteration already.

1808
01:31:25,143 --> 01:31:29,480
The truth is we're still
adapting some points of it

1809
01:31:29,479 --> 01:31:33,289
because technically, we
decided on all the parts,

1810
01:31:33,289 --> 01:31:35,810
and we're just
implementing it right now,

1811
01:31:35,810 --> 01:31:38,660
and refinding it, and
correcting the bugs.

1812
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:40,399
So that was actually done.

1813
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,329
And we're now building
the last prototype

1814
01:31:44,329 --> 01:31:49,100
or the last, actually, robot
that is going to go there.

1815
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,210
And on the thing about
achieving our goal,

1816
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:55,520
so what are the
mission criterias,

1817
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,880
that's going to be written
down in the project proposal,

1818
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:02,980
or the paper, that we're going
to give to our stakeholders.

1819
01:32:02,979 --> 01:32:06,449
So the Antarctica
Institute of Ecuador.

1820
01:32:06,449 --> 01:32:09,050


1821
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:15,110
So one part will be the
power autonomy and also

1822
01:32:15,109 --> 01:32:17,349
the communication--

1823
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:21,070
like, it has a
reliable communication.

1824
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:24,719
And one part will be also
the scientific payload,

1825
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:27,860
there will be insights
of conducting experiments

1826
01:32:27,859 --> 01:32:28,460
on the field.

1827
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,069


1828
01:32:31,069 --> 01:32:32,856
You want to add something, Sam?

1829
01:32:32,856 --> 01:32:39,000
SAM: Yes, 100 meters
per day [INAUDIBLE]

1830
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,720
Very concrete
goals, can we drive

1831
01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:43,350
100 meters per day, yes or no?

1832
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:47,720
Can we log every
minute, every data point

1833
01:32:47,720 --> 01:32:51,190
that we collect temperature
pressure, et cetera?

1834
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:53,699
Can we log that, and can
we send that to the base?

1835
01:32:53,699 --> 01:32:57,649
Like, does the 15
kilometer range of the LoRa

1836
01:32:57,649 --> 01:32:59,729
is that [INAUDIBLE] or not?

1837
01:32:59,729 --> 01:33:01,219
Does that work?

1838
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:04,670
And of course, does the
satellite communications work?

1839
01:33:04,670 --> 01:33:08,720
So once they will send
back a summary of the data,

1840
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,122
and we want to
see if that works,

1841
01:33:11,122 --> 01:33:12,829
if we can calculate
all the stuff that we

1842
01:33:12,829 --> 01:33:16,029
want, on the rover,
and if we get

1843
01:33:16,029 --> 01:33:18,246
that stuff back [INAUDIBLE]?

1844
01:33:18,246 --> 01:33:20,300
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Good, thank you.

1845
01:33:20,300 --> 01:33:21,150
One final question?

1846
01:33:21,149 --> 01:33:24,759


1847
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:25,940
Anybody at EPFL?

1848
01:33:25,939 --> 01:33:26,529
Here at MIT?

1849
01:33:26,529 --> 01:33:29,559


1850
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,990
OK, Sam has one more.

1851
01:33:31,989 --> 01:33:34,349
SAM: I just have
a question about--

1852
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,920
because it's going to be, I
guess, situated near our base,

1853
01:33:36,920 --> 01:33:39,230
is there any thought
about, sort of like,

1854
01:33:39,229 --> 01:33:43,339
how maintenance would work
when it's in operation

1855
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,340
or if something happens?

1856
01:33:44,340 --> 01:33:49,675


1857
01:33:49,675 --> 01:33:51,762
RAFAEL: Well, the person
who is going to be there

1858
01:33:51,761 --> 01:33:54,250
will be in charge of
doing maintenance,

1859
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:57,027
so if something happens,
if it gets stuck somewhere,

1860
01:33:57,027 --> 01:33:58,460
he will rescue it.

1861
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:03,090
And if some parts fall, he'll
provide the replacement parts,

1862
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:06,119
of course, so we will not
just send that thing there

1863
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:10,289
and hope it works.

1864
01:34:10,289 --> 01:34:13,497
Yeah, we have some
backup plans as well.

1865
01:34:13,497 --> 01:34:14,329
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

1866
01:34:14,329 --> 01:34:14,828
SAM: Great.

1867
01:34:14,828 --> 01:34:17,210
OLIVIER DE WECK: Sounds
like Sam is interested.

1868
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:19,500
RAFAEL: We have another
question here at EPFL as well.

1869
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,520
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, do one more,

1870
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:22,190
and then we'll
close the session.

1871
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,201
Go ahead.

1872
01:34:24,201 --> 01:34:25,699
AUDIENCE: Well, I
was just wondering

1873
01:34:25,699 --> 01:34:29,269
if you believe-- if you had
followed all what we have seen

1874
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:32,300
here in this class about
the procedures, PDR, CDR,

1875
01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:36,320
and so on, would that
have hindered you

1876
01:34:36,319 --> 01:34:38,539
in being so reactive?

1877
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:41,555
Or do you feel that you
can be reactive while still

1878
01:34:41,555 --> 01:34:43,695
following all those procedures?

1879
01:34:43,694 --> 01:34:46,364


1880
01:34:46,364 --> 01:34:49,934
RAFAEL: A good
question, thank you.

1881
01:34:49,935 --> 01:34:53,635
Certain points of the
concepts that we have seen

1882
01:34:53,635 --> 01:34:58,030
would have improved,
especially the efficiency

1883
01:34:58,029 --> 01:35:00,550
in the design procedure.

1884
01:35:00,550 --> 01:35:05,350
So going down step
by step would help

1885
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:11,320
us to exactly create
what we defined before

1886
01:35:11,319 --> 01:35:14,769
and not go too much into
different directions.

1887
01:35:14,770 --> 01:35:19,650
But on the other hand, the fact
that we explore our traits,

1888
01:35:19,649 --> 01:35:21,599
those [INAUDIBLE]
in the beginning,

1889
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:26,470
makes that we might have an
even better solution because we

1890
01:35:26,470 --> 01:35:28,570
wouldn't have thought
about this before when

1891
01:35:28,569 --> 01:35:31,939
we were in the upper
part of the [INAUDIBLE]..

1892
01:35:31,939 --> 01:35:34,149
So it's kind of a mix.

1893
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:38,559
I think a mix of this is
really the perfect approach

1894
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:40,700
for our project.

1895
01:35:40,699 --> 01:35:43,965
