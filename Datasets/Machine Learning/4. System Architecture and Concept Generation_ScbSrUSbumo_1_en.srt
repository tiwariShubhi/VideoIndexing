10
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,300
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,100
So let's see.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,150
Mr. Sticky.

13
00:00:29,149 --> 00:00:30,739
Let's see, EPFL.

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,129
Who picked Mr. Sticky?

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,840
Anybody?

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,230
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

17
00:00:38,229 --> 00:00:42,140
So the definition is a
cylindrical container

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,429
containing a date covered with
a [? basic ?] substance that

19
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:50,600
can be deployed in order to
attract and capture insects.

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,710
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good.

21
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,079
I'm glad you added the
last part because I

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,059
was worried that
you weren't going

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,920
to talk about the function.

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,890
So it's good.

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,640
I think it's good.

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,640
You started describing
the form, and then you

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,049
explained what the
function is at the end.

28
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:08,030
So that's good.

29
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,900
Anybody else do Mr. Sticky here?

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,400
Yeah.

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,780
Do you want to share?

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,310
AUDIENCE: So we said it
was a portable canister

33
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,730
deployable, fly-attracting
sticky tape,

34
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,201
fly-catching mechanism.

35
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,887
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right.

36
00:01:24,887 --> 00:01:26,719
Yeah, I think you've
got the right elements.

37
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,140
I think it needs to
flow a little better,

38
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,480
but you've got the
right ingredients there.

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,790
What about the i3.

40
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,950
Anybody?

41
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,650
Yeah, go ahead.

42
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,149
Justice.

43
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,775
AUDIENCE: You said
it was an efficiency

44
00:01:39,775 --> 00:01:43,287
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

45
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:44,620
OLIVIER DE WECK: Say that again?

46
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,050


47
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:51,605
AUDIENCE: Can you turn
on the mic, please?

48
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:53,079
AUDIENCE: Does yours work?

49
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,489
OLIVIER DE WECK: Do it again.

50
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,239
AUDIENCE: We said
it was an efficiency

51
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,640
and urban-optimized transport
vehicle made by BMW.

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,480
OLIVIER DE WECK: Urban-optimized
transport vehicle.

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,275
I think it's good.

54
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,900


55
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,699
I think you're
missing the effect

56
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,500
that it's an all-electric, the
fact that it's fundamentally

57
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,840
an electric vehicle.

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,185
I think it's key to the i3.

59
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:20,810
Because you have you
have other urban--

60
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,050
like the smart car.

61
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,640
And so architecturally,
distinguishing feature

62
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,299
is definitely the
electric drive.

63
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,090
So I think it's
good, but I think

64
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,610
you're just missing a little
bit on the technology there.

65
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,620
What about i3 and EPFL?

66
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,849
Anybody do the i3?

67
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,425


68
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:39,564
AUDIENCE: Nobody.

69
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:41,409
OLIVIER DE WECK: Nobody.

70
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:42,770
Anybody else here?

71
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,898
Yeah, Veronica.

72
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:46,810
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

73
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,599
Sorry.

74
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,199
A transportation system
responsible for moving people

75
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,239
and products with an
enclosed metal frame

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,040
equipped with various
safety devices

77
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,319
using electrically-powered
control and locomotion

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,912
subsystems.

79
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,800
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK.

80
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,760
That's pretty good.

81
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,120
There's a lot there.

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,750
I would throw a question.

83
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,889
A concept you defined could
almost apply to a Tramway

84
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,659
as well.

85
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,418
If this was like a
streetcar, don't you

86
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:14,960
think it would apply
to that as well?

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,790
So I think the fact that
it's a personal vehicle,

88
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:21,409
I think it's important.

89
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,109
So the key in this is, describe
the concept using few words

90
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,930
precisely, but to set it apart
from neighboring concepts.

91
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,069
What about Rolex Center?

92
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:37,115


93
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

94
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,579
It's a single-layer
building with multiple straw

95
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,820
used as a library for
people to meet and study.

96
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:53,709
OLIVIER DE WECK: A single-story
building using multiple--

97
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,195
AUDIENCE: --floors.

98
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,359
OLIVIER DE WECK: Floors.

99
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:56,860
Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,620
So that's right.

101
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,710
AUDIENCE: You have one layer.

102
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:05,020
However, it has this wave
shape and therefore, you

103
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,370
have something
akin to two floors.

104
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:10,480
So the library is one
something like the upper floor

105
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,229
and the meeting areas, the
noisy areas on the lower floors.

106
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,019
So you can connect
both, but the noise

107
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,324
doesn't connect that easily.

108
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

109
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,340
No, that's very good, and I
think that's the architectural.

110
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:24,939
And then the library is there.

111
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:25,719
That's for sure?

112
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,510
But isn't there a lot of
other things or services

113
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,399
provided in that building
beyond the library?

114
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,085


115
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:41,360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have a bank,
a cafeteria, student services.

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,180
But you could encompass
it in a meeting area.

117
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:50,209
You meet and you do some stuff
like eating, going to the bank.

118
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,120
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,144
AUDIENCE: I think we
missed some functions.

120
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,060
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,540
So I like your
definition, but I think

122
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,129
by pointing out
the library, you're

123
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,980
missing the other functions.

124
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,080
And my understanding is that
the reason this was built

125
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,729
was to put two things.

126
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,129
One, is it's a focal point
for the community at EPFL.

127
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,480
We have a student
center here at MIT.

128
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,129
People go there to do their
banking, their eating,

129
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,550
their meeting, and so forth.

130
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,480
So in that sense,
it's pretty similar,

131
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,720
but I think the Rolex Center
is such an iconic building

132
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,640
that it also serve a kind
of a prestige function,

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,759
to put the institution
on the map in terms

134
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,039
of it's a statement.

135
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
It's not just a
utilitarian building.

136
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,790
Whereas, I would argue
our MIT student center,

137
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,250
it has very similar functions
to the Rolex Center,

138
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,629
but I wouldn't call
it an iconic building.

139
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,870
It doesn't have that wow factor.

140
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:52,000
Would you guys agree with that?

141
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,810
Yeah.

142
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,000
Maybe it did when it
was initially built.

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,790
I'm not sure, but very good.

144
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:02,530
So we could spend a lot of time
on these, but really crisply

145
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,959
refining and thinking about the
concept is very, very important

146
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:11,049
So let me very quickly go
through the refrigerator case

147
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,000
study to show how do we
transition from concept

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,829
to design.

149
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:21,740
So the first thing you do is
understand where is the value--

150
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,250
the stakeholders
and the stakeholder

151
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,240
analysis and the
requirements definition.

152
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,280
And so in order to do that,
you ask the question, first

153
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,469
of all, value identification.

154
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,660
Where is the value?

155
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,120
And so you understand that
then who is the beneficiary?

156
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,470
That's a stakeholder.

157
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,200
The stakeholder has needs.

158
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,819
I'm using OPM here
to describe this.

159
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,639
And then this is a
funny thing here.

160
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,560
The needs have
these little bumps.

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,014
This is meant to
indicate a cloud.

162
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:57,129


163
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:59,680
This is not standard
OPM nomenclature.

164
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,009
Just point that out.

165
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:04,930
So this means that the
needs are somewhat vaporous.

166
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,120
They're not very well defined.

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,439
And then you interpret and
incorporate some of the needs

168
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,110
into goals, which
become requirements.

169
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,050
And so the goals then
are an instrument

170
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,710
of the primary delivery value
delivering process, which

171
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:22,509
is your value proposition.

172
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:24,370
To then actually
deliver that value

173
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,670
you need to design the product,
the product system, the product

174
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:32,680
object, and understand the
operand, the thing that

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,079
is being operated
on or transformed

176
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,740
by the primary value
delivery process.

177
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,360
That's a very abstract,
high-level way

178
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,350
to think about where's
the value in the system.

179
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,910
But fundamentally, this is part
of the reducing ambiguity work

180
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,800
that you do as a
system architect,

181
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
as a system engineer.

182
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,400
And there is a recipe
for doing this.

183
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,419
So first you start examining the
operand associated with value.

184
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,400
What's really the
thing that generates

185
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,789
the value that the user, the
beneficiaries care about.

186
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,129
Next you say, this is
the attribute link.

187
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,550
What attributes of the
upper are changing or being

188
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,069
affected associated with value?

189
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:15,159
And so the
attribute-transforming process

190
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,640
is where the value is generated.

191
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:25,759
So for food, I think we briefly
talked about this before.

192
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,180
Usually people will say, when
you think about a refrigerator,

193
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,829
keep the food cold.

194
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,308
But if you step back
and think about it

195
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:36,649
in a more abstract
way, it's really

196
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,009
about preserving
food or reducing

197
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,960
the spoilage rate of the food.

198
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,350
So the refrigerator
effectively becomes a food

199
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,009
spoilage rate reduction device.

200
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,379
and I know that sounds
terrible, but that

201
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:56,189
is really what it's about.

202
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,910


203
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:01,110
So when once you
think that way, you

204
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,620
can really start being creative
and focus your creativity.

205
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,440
So here we have the
food, and our goal

206
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,990
is to reduce its spoilage rate.

207
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,110
And then you can ask,
well, how can we do this?

208
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,690
What are all the
different ways of reducing

209
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:18,990
the spoilage rate of the food?

210
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,750
So from among the system
operating processes,

211
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:27,539
we then specialize and pick a
particular one for our concept.

212
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:31,019
So beside chilling or
keeping the food cold,

213
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,360
we could irradiate the food.

214
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,259
We could we dry the food.

215
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,889
What are some other ways that
we can reduce the spoilage rate?

216
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,009
So irradiating,
drying, chilling.

217
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:43,509
Sam?

218
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:44,402
AUDIENCE: Preserving.

219
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:45,568
OLIVIER DE WECK: Preserving.

220
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:48,439
So you add chemicals
essentially.

221
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,060
EPFL, how else can we do it?

222
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,289
Spoilage rate reduction?

223
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,573
AUDIENCE: Using chemicals?

224
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:56,490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

225
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,609
So that's chemical.

226
00:09:59,609 --> 00:10:00,150
That's right.

227
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,110
What else?

228
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,600
Keep going.

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,700
Because food is pretty
essential for humans,

230
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,310
this is actually
one of the areas

231
00:10:08,309 --> 00:10:11,259
where humans have
been very creative.

232
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:13,019
There's a lot of
ways to do this.

233
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,535
So keep going.

234
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:18,369
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for example,
for conserving grapes,

235
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,730
maybe you do wine,
which is a process

236
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,590
to conserve this
wonderful [INAUDIBLE]..

237
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,670
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

238
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:32,531
Please keep some wine
for us too, please.

239
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,720
AUDIENCE: Beer is the same.

240
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,000
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,870
So marinating it,
vacuum packing, smoking,

242
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,070
on and on and on.

243
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,010
My favorite is
actually eating it.

244
00:10:49,009 --> 00:10:50,120
What do bears do?

245
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,019
How do bears conserve food?

246
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,184
AUDIENCE: Fat.

247
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:54,059
OLIVIER DE WECK: Fat.

248
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:54,558
Right?

249
00:10:54,558 --> 00:10:57,629
So bears, they actually
consume it and then

250
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:02,159
transform it into fat, into
a different storage form,

251
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,169
store it inside their
bodies, and then

252
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:10,709
as they hibernate,
that energy, that food

253
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,440
is being gradually consumed.

254
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,570
That's a very different
way, but it's essentially

255
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,200
the same function.

256
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,050
So that's the key idea is start
thinking in this abstract way,

257
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:26,309
and all of a sudden all
these other possibilities

258
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,949
become possible.

259
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,640
And that's really the cool part
about design and creativity.

260
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,460
But eventually, you have to
pick a particular concept.

261
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,195
So the chilling
part is not enough.

262
00:11:39,195 --> 00:11:40,200
That's the function.

263
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,120
And then you say, well,
we need a chiller.

264
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,571
In order to chill,
we need a chiller,

265
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,320
and there are different
types of chillers,

266
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,450
like a cooler or refrigerator.

267
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,020
And it's the combination
of this specific way you're

268
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,329
going to operate the system.

269
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,389
The element of form and then
the specialized element of form,

270
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:00,840
in this case the
cooler, that combination

271
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,480
is what we call concept.

272
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,050
So once we have that, we can
start managing complexity,

273
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:11,069
decomposing function and form,
so our system operating process

274
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,820
gets decomposed into the
primary supporting processes

275
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,640
like interfacing,
powering, controlling.

276
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,399
And then our system object,
you can decompose it

277
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
into different elements,
supporting systems,

278
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,620
the operand, the
operator, and so forth.

279
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,909
And then we can start
connecting them.

280
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:30,899
So let's look at for
chilling the food,

281
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:33,509
let's look at a cooler
and a refrigerator

282
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,549
in terms of this decomposition.

283
00:12:35,549 --> 00:12:38,039
So here's a picture of
a very simple cooler

284
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,019
that you would take
out on a picnic.

285
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,509
It has the chilling
function, and then

286
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:47,159
the sub-functions when we
zoom in are holding the food,

287
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,789
exchanging the heat between
the food and the environment,

288
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,519
reducing the heat load,
interfacing, connecting,

289
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,669
powering, regulating the
temperature, et cetera.

290
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:59,009
And then on the form
side, the cooler

291
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:01,559
itself is very
simple structurally.

292
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:05,589
It just has a bottom, a box
with a bottom and a top.

293
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,250
And then we have the
ice, the food supporting

294
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,549
the surface, the external
heat load, ambient light,

295
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:13,009
and the operator.

296
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,559
What's surprising here
is when you map the two,

297
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,529
there's a surprising
amount of complexity.

298
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,110
It's not a very clear
one-to-one mapping.

299
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,700
Let's just look at the ice.

300
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,420
So here's the ice, and you can
just follow these links to see

301
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,799
what functions, sub-functions
does the ice support--

302
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,740
exchanging heat, powering,
and regulating temperature.

303
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,039
So exchanging heat
means, essentially,

304
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,289
the ice itself acts
as a heat exchanger.

305
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:46,360
Just the surface
of the ice is where

306
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,700
the heat exchange happens.

307
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,210
So what forms can you
put ice into a cooler?

308
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,046
What are the different
shapes of ice

309
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,420
that you could
put into a cooler?

310
00:13:58,419 --> 00:14:03,029


311
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:04,470
AUDIENCE: Like an ice pack.

312
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,149
OLIVIER DE WECK: You
could put ice pack

313
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,069
or you could put
a block or chips.

314
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:16,090
And if you put the
same quantity of ice,

315
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,190
but you put a block of
ice, you put little chips,

316
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,660
what will be the difference?

317
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:24,000
Will there be a difference?

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,289
Surface area, right?

319
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:28,349
So the speed at
which the ice will

320
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,290
melt for the same given
external temperature

321
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,409
is going to be different.

322
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:39,629
So there's an attribute of
the ice, which is essentially

323
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,289
its quantity, but also it's
form that will influence the--

324
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,779
but that's the heat
exchanger function.

325
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:49,139
The powering function
is pretty clear.

326
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:55,240
That's essentially the
energy storage right there.

327
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,450
And then the third
one is regulation.

328
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,140
How does that work?

329
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,057
How does the ice provide
a thermal regulation

330
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:02,639
in the cooler?

331
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,379


332
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:07,649
Physics 101.

333
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,601
Yeah?

334
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:10,975
Go ahead.

335
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:11,851
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

336
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:12,809
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right.

337
00:15:12,809 --> 00:15:15,959
So as long as you have any
ice left in the cooler,

338
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,540
what will be the
temperature inside?

339
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,879
Not opening and
closing, but if you

340
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,529
keep it closed, what will be
the temperature in the cooler?

341
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:24,725
AUDIENCE: 0 Celsius.

342
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:25,850
OLIVIER DE WECK: 0 Celsius.

343
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,620
As long as you
have ice left, this

344
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,399
is the phase transformation,
you're at that point.

345
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,019
As soon as the ice
is all melting,

346
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:34,399
the temperature will rise.

347
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,230
So the phase transformation of
the ice from solid to liquid

348
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,330
is what, in fact,
is the regulation

349
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,009
mechanism inside the cooler.

350
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,470
So even though you
think of a cooler

351
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,590
as being something super
simple and trivial,

352
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,720
once you start listing
its internal functions

353
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,370
and how the top, the
bottom the ice itself,

354
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:59,029
how they interact and
support those functions,

355
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:01,339
it's pretty complex.

356
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,139
And you can go
very detailed here,

357
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:07,499
even for something very
simple like a cooler.

358
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,790
One question and then we'll
talk about the refrigerator

359
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:11,689
and how it's
different in a minute.

360
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,380
One question I
often get is what's

361
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:19,000
the difference between system
architecting and system design?

362
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,309
Isn't that the same thing?

363
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:23,399
And I think they're
somewhat different.

364
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,100
They're overlapping, but
there's a distinction.

365
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,629
So architecture selects the
concept, the decomposition,

366
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,970
mapping of function to form.

367
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,490
And architecture
essentially establishes

368
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,039
the vector of design variables.

369
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,949
What are the key design
variables and operating

370
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,110
parameters of the system?

371
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:48,690
Design, then, given that,
selects the actual values

372
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,350
for those design variables,
and then you can optimize.

373
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,279
So if we look at the
example of the cooler here,

374
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:00,839
we have our cooler with the box
in the bottom and then the ice,

375
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,540
and we can decompose
the attributes of that.

376
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,250
So the box with bottom
has length with height.

377
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,380
It has a wall thickness.

378
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,750
It has a type of material.

379
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,180
The top has thickness
and material,

380
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,099
and the ice, like we
just talked about,

381
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:19,019
has quantity, surface area, and
maybe initial water content.

382
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:20,759
And those are the
operating parameters,

383
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,118
and on the upper right, those
are the design variables.

384
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:26,490
So when you are making
a material choice,

385
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,039
we're going to use PVC.

386
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,970
We're going to have a
2.1-inch thick wall.

387
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,839
We're going to use
this much insulation.

388
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,949
This will be the aspect
ratio of the cooler.

389
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,009
It's going to have wheels
maybe, so we can pull it easily.

390
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,559
Those are essentially
design decisions.

391
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,759
You're instantiating
that concept.

392
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:50,940
But the fact that it
has a bottom and a top

393
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,390
and it's hinged and
it uses this phase

394
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,690
transition as the
regulation mechanism,

395
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,920
that's conceptual design.

396
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,840
That's system architecture,
and you need to do both.

397
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:05,129
But they're not quite the same.

398
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,370
Is that pretty clear?

399
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:10,000
That's a very
important distinction.

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
So let's look at
the form function

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,430
mapping for refrigerators.

402
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,590
So this is actually
a big difference

403
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:18,389
between the US and Switzerland.

404
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,870
People in the US, we like
to have big refrigerators,

405
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,989
big gallon of milk, and
refrigerators in Switzerland

406
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,370
are much smaller.

407
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:27,309
I'm not sure why.

408
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,450
Maybe you go
shopping more often,

409
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,880
but it's definitely one
of the big differences.

410
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,170
But here we have essentially
the decomposition

411
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,400
of the refrigerator.

412
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,840
So we have racks.

413
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,709
We have the air.

414
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,019
We have-- I guess
freon is banned now,

415
00:18:43,019 --> 00:18:44,660
so we should use some other.

416
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,710
This is a refrigerant, a
working fluid, the insulation,

417
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,340
the feet and rollers, the frame,
the electric motor, sensors,

418
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:55,113
controller doors, lights.

419
00:18:55,114 --> 00:18:57,029
And then we have those
functions, essentially,

420
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:00,420
the same functions we had for
the cooler, holding the food,

421
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,590
exchanging the heat,
powering, regulating.

422
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:07,230
But the difference is
that we have much more

423
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,740
of a one-to-one mapping.

424
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,220
So in the refrigerator,
each of these elements

425
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,180
supports, essentially, one
of the primary sub-functions.

426
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,750
So the form function
mapping in the refrigerator

427
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,859
is actually much simpler.

428
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,649
It's a much simpler
form function

429
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,480
mapping than the cooler.

430
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,299
And you say, well, I thought
a refrigerator is much more

431
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,409
complex.

432
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,769
How can that be?

433
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,369
Well, the real complexity
comes in when you

434
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,219
look at the form form mapping.

435
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,009
So this is then
the decomposition

436
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:41,365
of the refrigerator in terms
of all the elements of form

437
00:19:41,365 --> 00:19:42,990
and then how they
relate to each other.

438
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,380
And I'm not showing here
all the sub-processes,

439
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,280
but you can see that the
mapping and the relationships

440
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:54,930
are much more complex than
in the case of the cooler.

441
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:01,640
So to wrap up on this piece,
when we do a conceptual design

442
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,950
or system architecture, you
have two major activities.

443
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,370
One is concept generation.

444
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:10,849
So take the requirements
and think creatively

445
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,429
about how these requirements
could be fulfilled.

446
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,950
So that means
understanding the operand,

447
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:18,730
the attribute of the operand
that you're trying to affect--

448
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,960
it could be multiple here--

449
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,660
the intent attribute--
this means the required,

450
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,250
desired state--

451
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,589
what is the system
operating process,

452
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:30,019
and what is your
major element of form.

453
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:33,109
So that's generating this
and specializing that.

454
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,659
That's concept generation,
finding systems

455
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,519
that do the right thing.

456
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:39,446
And then once you
have several concepts,

457
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,029
you've got to select
among them, which

458
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:42,440
we'll talk about next week.

459
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,230
That's our topic next
week is concept selection.

460
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,509
So finding systems
that do the right thing

461
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:51,890
and do it well, deliver value,
and comply with regulations,

462
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,220
standards, and so forth.

463
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,000
So there's going to be
consumables involved,

464
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,710
side effects, like noise,
waste heat, pollution.

465
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,650
The operator, how skilled
does the operator has to be

466
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,820
or how autonomous is the system.

467
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,129
What is the reliability,
safety, cost, the quantity.

468
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,270
All those things are
describing the concept

469
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:16,639
and its instantiation
in more detail

470
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,580
and will help you do
concept selection.

471
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:20,179
Do you do you see
the difference?

472
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,430
Concept generation is
take the requirements

473
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,110
and come up with the fundamental
form function mapping of how

474
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:29,099
the requirements can be met.

475
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:32,869
Then you instantiate
that in terms of designs

476
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,049
and then you can evaluate
those and compare concepts

477
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:39,019
using other criteria
like consumables,

478
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:44,059
quantity, how skilled does the
operator have to be, et cetera.

479
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,919
So those are fundamentally
different activities.

480
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,050
So let me summarize
on system architecture

481
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:54,849
and then talk about the NASA
approach and then creativity.

482
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,250
So architecture
requires consideration

483
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,160
of both function and form
related through concept.

484
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,769
It's about starting
with the operand.

485
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:05,710
What is the thing that the
beneficiary, the stakeholder

486
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,670
cares about, and how
do we transform that?

487
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,640
Concept then elaborate
these into architectures

488
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,370
that have form function
and structural complexity.

489
00:22:15,369 --> 00:22:17,289
And then the goodness
of an architecture

490
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:19,899
is really a pretty
complex concept

491
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,750
where we have multiple
objectives to satisfy,

492
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,859
including performance, resource
utilization, cost, operability,

493
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:29,809
safety, capacity, and so forth.

494
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:33,099
And we'll defer
that to next week.

495
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:36,279
So let me briefly talk about
the NASA approach to this

496
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,500
and then talk about
some methods and tools

497
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,900
for concept generation.

498
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,810
So the NASA approach
is basically

499
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:45,339
described in the
system engineering

500
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,519
handbook in the SE
engine as step 3

501
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,410
called logical decomposition.

502
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,590
And so the logical
decomposition process,

503
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:58,569
as described in
the NASA standard,

504
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:00,549
is used to improve
the understanding

505
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:03,579
of the technical requirements
and the relationship

506
00:23:03,579 --> 00:23:08,919
among those, transforming that
initial set of requirements

507
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,200
into a decomposition.

508
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,410
So the idea that we need
to partition the system

509
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:17,500
and then derive lower-level
technical requirements based

510
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,859
on that lower-level
definition, and that's what's

511
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:23,009
called architecting.

512
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,670
Getting back to our high-level
system design process,

513
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,620
this is, again, that
diagram that we've looked

514
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,199
at several times already.

515
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,450
You can see the red box
is where this happened.

516
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:37,019
So we started with mission
authority, stakeholder

517
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,930
expectation, and then defining
those high-level requirements.

518
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,890
Level 0, level 1 requirements,
but then you get stuck.

519
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,650
You get stuck because you
have to make some decisions

520
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,009
before you can go to lower
level requirements definition.

521
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,589
And that's what's known here
as functional and logical

522
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,029
decomposition.

523
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:56,129
Once you've decided
on a composition

524
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,130
and you can carry several
compositions with you

525
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,990
for a while, then you can do
the lower-level trade studies,

526
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,410
derive and allocate
lower-level requirements refine

527
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,450
your CONOPS, and so forth.

528
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,880
And then do functional
and performance analysis

529
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,090
to see whether you
have enough detail.

530
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,019
Is it workable?

531
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:16,779
Is it safe?

532
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:18,119
Is it reliable?

533
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:22,019
And if yes, then you can select
that as a baseline, if not,

534
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:25,139
you might have to go back
to the red box, which means

535
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,759
that architecture didn't work.

536
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,710
We have to look for a
different decomposition

537
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,269
or different architecture.

538
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,210
And if that doesn't work after
multiple iterations here,

539
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,173
you might have to go back
and change the requirements,

540
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,589
because you come
to the conclusion

541
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:41,589
that the requirements are
not really achievable.

542
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:46,000
So some examples here
of decomposition models,

543
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,029
here's a timing diagram.

544
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:50,099
On the right side, you
have a state diagram,

545
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:52,559
the different states that
the system can be in.

546
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,190
So you can see this relates very
strongly to the system modeling

547
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,809
languages that we talked about.

548
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:59,940
So you use the system
modeling languages

549
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,360
to decompose and define
the system in more detail.

550
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,679
And we really talked about
much of this already.

551
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,820
And in terms of the logical
decomposition flow diagram,

552
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:18,359
you start with your basic
high-level requirements

553
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:19,979
and measures of performance.

554
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,039
You essentially do
your decomposition.

555
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,430
And then on the right side, you
come out with the lower-level

556
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,330
derived technical requirements,
logical decomposition models,

557
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,069
which would be
essentially a description

558
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:37,349
of your different subsystems
and the logical decomposition

559
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,369
work products, which are
essentially lower-level

560
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:44,039
definitions of what these
subsystems look like.

561
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:47,190
And then you can go off and do
the detailed design and then

562
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:50,930
the testing verification
and so forth.

563
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:54,060
So it's essentially
focused on decomposition,

564
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:56,700
which is an important
part of architecting,

565
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:59,600
but it's not the
only thing you do.

566
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,879
So let me talk about methods and
tools for concept generation.

567
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,241
So I'm going to start with this.

568
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,269
This is another really fun
thing we do in the system design

569
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,089
and management program,
which is a full-year program,

570
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:16,029
is the we call it the
creativity workshop.

571
00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:21,009
So what are different ways
of stimulating or organizing

572
00:26:21,009 --> 00:26:21,789
creativity.

573
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,369
And what I'm showing
you here is--

574
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:26,500
that's essentially a
mind map of how to think

575
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,690
about the creativity space.

576
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,630
So I'll briefly go through
this, and then we'll

577
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,170
look at a couple of examples.

578
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:39,100
So one idea is that
creativity is better

579
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:43,309
if it's a group process, that
people stimulate each other.

580
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:46,839
And so this whole group up
there is called group dynamics.

581
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,399
These are all different methods
for stimulating creativity

582
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,640
using groups of people.

583
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,009
And some of these are
authors that have written

584
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:01,839
and methods, so de Bono, Six
Hats, powwows, mind boggling,

585
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:04,389
workouts, creativity
workouts, these

586
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,080
are all different variations
of group dynamic processes.

587
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,240
The one that I'll talk
about in some more detail

588
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,980
is brainstorming.

589
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,990
This is probably the best known.

590
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,089
What's not so much known
about brainstorming

591
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:18,029
is that there's a
right way to do it.

592
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,920


593
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,720
On the upper right
branch, creativity

594
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,589
and system architecture,
this is just

595
00:27:26,589 --> 00:27:29,500
describing the importance of
it, the three themes we talked

596
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,440
about-- creativity,
ambiguity, complexity,

597
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,850
different types of innovation,
radical innovation, modular,

598
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:39,759
or incremental innovation, and
so forth, and the high leverage

599
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,319
that it has.

600
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,799
The next branch are called
models of creativity.

601
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,659
What that essentially
means, and I'll

602
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,990
give you one example here,
which is Leonardo da Vinci,

603
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,109
is understanding
people that universally

604
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:57,879
are claimed as having been
very creative thinkers.

605
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,960
Why were they creative?

606
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,980
What was their
recipe for success?

607
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,470
Below that, we have
structured processes,

608
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,850
which are essentially trying to
organize the creativity, which

609
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:11,759
seems like an oxymoron,
but there are actually

610
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:14,519
ways to have a
structured process

611
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:16,619
to stimulate concept generation.

612
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,589
And we'll talk about very
briefly mind mapping and then

613
00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:21,720
morphological matrices.

614
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,329
And then we have
this whole area here,

615
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:27,240
which I'm going to
mention, but we're not

616
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,049
going to do as part of the
class, which is stimulants.

617
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,049
So this is the idea
that somehow people

618
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,039
are more creative when
their brain, when you put

619
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:40,259
yourself into some other state.

620
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,109
So bio-inspired design
would be you go in nature,

621
00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:48,929
or you read books about
seashells and animals and you

622
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,900
really try to
understand from nature--

623
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,750
and bio-inspired design
is a very important field

624
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,970
of research now.

625
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,890
It's pretty serious.

626
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,230
So you put yourself
in nature and be

627
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,200
inspired by what you see.

628
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,299
Random inputs, provocations,
challenges, and then things

629
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,509
like alcohol, and even drugs.

630
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:16,049
So a lot of the music that
was done in the hippie age

631
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:18,529
in the '60s, I mean,
a lot of these artists

632
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:21,899
were consuming large amounts
of drugs and alcohol.

633
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,160
And there's a big discussion
on is this fundamentally

634
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,509
why they were creative.

635
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,400
So I'm not advocating that.

636
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm just I'm just
telling you that there

637
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,090
is this idea that you
can stimulate creativity

638
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:38,079
in these different ways.

639
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,500
So let's talk
about mind mapping.

640
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,549
So this is an example of a
mind map that I really liked.

641
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:47,220
This is from several years ago.

642
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,329
This is from a student that took
the system architecture class.

643
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:57,000
And so the idea of a mind map
is that you look inside yourself

644
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,250
and you try to put down on a map
different ideas and concepts.

645
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,960
So in the core of it, you
have the key focal point

646
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,950
of the mind map.

647
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,680
In this case, it's
system architecture,

648
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,019
and then you have these
branches coming off.

649
00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:22,049
So the class itself, the skills,
the concepts, the themes,

650
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:24,930
and then it almost looks
like a neural network.

651
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,039
You branch off into the
sub ideas and sub concept.

652
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,680
And in order to really
make it memorable,

653
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,750
you draw it by hand
even though there

654
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,099
is software for doing this.

655
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,109
But I really like this, drawing
it by hand the old style.

656
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:44,490
And then you add icons
and symbols and colors

657
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,700
to really make this
sticky and memorable.

658
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,769
So you can look at that.

659
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:51,660
I really like this example.

660
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,500
And it probably takes
a couple of hours

661
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,390
to do a really good
mind map like this.

662
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,340
But the idea is
that by doing this,

663
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:03,799
you're going to develop
your ideas and concepts.

664
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,079
And there's books
about mind mapping.

665
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,009
I mean, it's a whole
industry almost.

666
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,569
Brainstorming.

667
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:15,480
So by the way, who
has done brainstorming

668
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,630
and organized brainstorming?

669
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,550
Who's been part of a
brainstorming exercise?

670
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:22,980
Do you want to describe
it, how that worked?

671
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,422
Make sure you use the mic.

672
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:30,150
AUDIENCE: So we started
with our problem,

673
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:35,467
and if I remember it right, it
was to redesign a coffee mug.

674
00:31:35,467 --> 00:31:37,050
OLIVIER DE WECK:
This was for a class?

675
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:38,369
AUDIENCE: Yes.

676
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:44,909
And then basically, for the
first part, any idea could go.

677
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,390
And the only role
was you couldn't

678
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,140
criticize anyone else's idea.

679
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,290
So he basically tried to come
up with as much as we could,

680
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,858
wrote as much as we
could on the board,

681
00:31:57,858 --> 00:31:58,899
things along those lines.

682
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,652
And then once we had
all of our ideas down

683
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:07,110
and some people built off of
other ones and then it was oh,

684
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:10,169
but we can also add this.

685
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,769
And then we started
to look at well,

686
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,990
we can't really believe that.

687
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,549
This is going to be
way too expensive

688
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,829
and started down
selecting from there.

689
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:22,799
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did you take
a break between the two parts?

690
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:23,605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

691
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,490
OLIVIER DE WECK: So yeah,
you described it very well.

692
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,599
So the key idea is
there's some rules for how

693
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,539
to properly do brainstorming,
and some of them

694
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,399
are listed here.

695
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,150
And then I have another
on the next chart,

696
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,130
there's sort of a step by step.

697
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,910
So it's really try to
remove creativity barriers,

698
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,470
stimulate each other.

699
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,829
There's an ideal group size,
and it says 5 to 10 here,

700
00:32:46,829 --> 00:32:49,949
but I should probably
revise this to be--

701
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,809
what do you think?

702
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:52,049
7 plus minus 2.

703
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:55,379
If you try to do brainstorming
session with 30 people

704
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,260
in the room, it's too big.

705
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:00,720
It's not going to
be that productive.

706
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,730
So use of intuition,
associations.

707
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,140
What's important
is that you have

708
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,940
a clear idea of why you're
doing the brainstorming session.

709
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,730
So there's some solution
neutral question,

710
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:14,370
like how can we
improve a coffee mug.

711
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,619
What did you come up with,
by the way, at the end?

712
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,186
Did you have a result?

713
00:33:18,186 --> 00:33:19,769
AUDIENCE: I think
it was we were going

714
00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,410
to redesign the handle so
it would be more ergonomic.

715
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,160
But, yeah.

716
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,610
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what can be
done too, how can we improve.

717
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:32,879
There's got to be a driving
question for the brainstorming

718
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,649
session.

719
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:37,439
Actually, the first
time this was described

720
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,230
was by AF Osborn in
this book in 1957.

721
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,839
There's why is
brainstorming useful.

722
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,029
We can talk about that.

723
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:50,460
A lot of it has to do
with this group dynamics.

724
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,920
How to organize and host
a brainstorming session.

725
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,509
I'll talk about that next.

726
00:33:54,509 --> 00:33:57,299
And then there's this killer
sentences you should never

727
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,559
say during a brainstorming.

728
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,329
Some of these are pretty funny.

729
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,909
And then what do you
do with the results.

730
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,430
How do you actually then take
the brainstorming results

731
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:08,849
and use them for further
refining or down-selecting

732
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,349
concepts.

733
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:15,809
So here's a six-step process for
doing a brainstorming session.

734
00:34:15,809 --> 00:34:21,279
So you send out invitations
a few days ahead of time.

735
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,840
And the idea is that people
can think about this question

736
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,300
so that when they come to
the brainstorming session,

737
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,730
their brain is
preloaded with ideas.

738
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:31,780
That's the idea.

739
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,380
You don't just pull people
in like five minutes earlier.

740
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,230
The idea is give a
few days, not weeks,

741
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,480
but a few days of
warning so that people

742
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,769
can think about this and come to
the brainstorming session ready

743
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:51,179
and charged to
share their ideas.

744
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:53,489
7 plus or minus 2 participants.

745
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:56,019
There should be a facilitator.

746
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:00,590
This is somebody who
is helping to moderate.

747
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,720
Participants take turns
expressing thoughts,

748
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,000
suggestions, ideas.

749
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,409
You should take notes.

750
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:09,559
So for example, these big
whiteboards are great for that,

751
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:12,199
with idea paint, the whole wall.

752
00:35:12,199 --> 00:35:13,129
That's great.

753
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,390
Or you can do flip charts.

754
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:17,420
You can do different ways
of capturing these ideas.

755
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,099
And then I think
you mentioned this.

756
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:22,579
It's called the principle
of delayed judgment.

757
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,730
So you're not
allowed to criticize

758
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,740
or particularly praise.

759
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:29,399
So you could, for
example say, oh,

760
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,170
this is the best idea we've
had so far in this session.

761
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,139
Even though it's praise,
it actually implicitly is

762
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:37,609
criticism of the other ideas.

763
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:38,720
So avoid that.

764
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,489
Avoid the killer phrases.

765
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:44,059
And then the idea there
is produce a large amount

766
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,730
and diversity of ideas.

767
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,000
And then at some point, maybe
30 to 60 minutes, you end.

768
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,750
Brainstorming session
that last four hours,

769
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:56,329
the first hour is
probably really good

770
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,759
and then the second hour
OK, and then the rest

771
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,850
is everybody is kind of
shot and, there's not

772
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,469
a lot of new ideas coming.

773
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,539
Creativity killer sentences.

774
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:08,679
I highlighted a few.

775
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:10,869
This will never work.

776
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,980
We don't even need
to talk about this.

777
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,990
Everybody does it this way.

778
00:36:14,989 --> 00:36:17,709
I've already studied
this problem for years.

779
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:20,679
Don't worry, I know I'm
right, and et cetera.

780
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,699
How long have you been
with this company?

781
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,759
Anyway, so that's the idea.

782
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,710
All right Leonardo.

783
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,970
Who's been to Italy
or tour in France,

784
00:36:33,969 --> 00:36:35,829
or who's seen one
of the exhibits

785
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:39,065
know where his notebooks
are on display?

786
00:36:39,065 --> 00:36:41,326
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

787
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:43,289
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

788
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:44,469
What about EPFL?

789
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:47,549
Have you guys seen
these wandering exhibits

790
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,710
about Leonardo's work
and his notebooks?

791
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,130
Anybody had a
chance to see that?

792
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,480
Go ahead.

793
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,889
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

794
00:36:55,889 --> 00:37:00,509
Actually, he do a lot of sketch,
and he [INAUDIBLE] the fact

795
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,344
that sketching is more
important than writing.

796
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:05,260
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah.

797
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,960
That's right.

798
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,900
So really, he didn't
build a lot of his ideas.

799
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,470
So that's one of the--
did he actually then.

800
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:15,329
But he was a head of
his time in many ways.

801
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,869
So he's really been identified
as an exceptional individual.

802
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,739
So here's a book called How
to Think Like Leonardo, Seven

803
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,329
Steps to Genius.

804
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:26,920
And I'm not a big fan
of these popular books,

805
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,039
but this one is
pretty interesting

806
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,025
because what's been
extracted from this

807
00:37:32,025 --> 00:37:37,019
is the seven da Vincian
principles of creativity.

808
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:39,302
And they're here in Italian.

809
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:41,260
I'm just going to go
through them very quickly.

810
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,220
So curiosita, lifelong
quest for learning.

811
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:48,149
Dimostratzione, testing your
knowledge through experience,

812
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,740
trying things out.

813
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:53,679
Sensazione, continual
refinement of the senses.

814
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,750
Sfumato, which is essentially
also a style of painting,

815
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,860
like the Mona Lisa is
painted in sfumato style.

816
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,079
Mastering ambiguity,
paradox, uncertainty.

817
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,190
Arte/Scienza is the whole brain
thinking, left-right brain.

818
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,650
Corporalita, balance of body
and mind, so a healthy mind

819
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,329
and a healthy body.

820
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,279
And then connessione
is interesting.

821
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,740
That gets close to system
architecture, which

822
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:27,059
is the appreciation of patterns,
relationships, connections,

823
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:28,469
and systems.

824
00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:32,099
So the idea is that,
this from Leonardo,

825
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:35,279
his work, his way of thinking,
these seven principles

826
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,240
have been extracted.

827
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,729
And then you can say,
well, which of these

828
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,490
do I feel really
resonate with me?

829
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:42,989
All right.

830
00:38:42,989 --> 00:38:45,699
So we have only a
few minutes left.

831
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:49,319
Let's move to some of
the structured processes

832
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,604
for creativity.

833
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:52,019
So the first one
I want to mention

834
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:54,809
is this is probably the
simplest and the one that's

835
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:55,860
used the most.

836
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:59,050
This is known as a
morphological matrix.

837
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,130
So the idea there
is that you try

838
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,420
to define what are the key
features, factors, or decisions

839
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,250
that you have to
make when you define

840
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,380
a concept or an architecture.

841
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,860
So the key decisions
are the rows.

842
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,079
Let's say there's
n key decisions.

843
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,880
There are factors in the rows.

844
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,369
And then for each row
you think about what

845
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:25,500
are the number of possible
alternatives for doing this.

846
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,019
And then you enumerate
all possible combinations.

847
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:31,050
So an example here
would be here's

848
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,560
our morphological matrix.

849
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:42,360
And then one possible concept
here would be A2, B1, C3.

850
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,130
That's our concept here.

851
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,329
And then you can see that for
a full-factorial enumeration,

852
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,670
you would have 27 architectures
that you could generate.

853
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,460
So the number of
architectures here

854
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,590
is 27, based on this
morphological matrix.

855
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,309
And I find this to be
very, very helpful.

856
00:40:02,309 --> 00:40:04,710
When the table gets
too big, very quickly

857
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,699
because of this being a product,
this can really explode on you.

858
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,349
It can be very large.

859
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:13,480
And the big challenge
with this, of course,

860
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,650
is if you have many factors, you
could generate many infeasible

861
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:17,400
architectures.

862
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,190
Not all these combinations
are actually feasible.

863
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,519
So the question then is,
how do you prevent that,

864
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,780
and that's where so-called
architecture enumeration comes

865
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,740
in.

866
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:31,750
And I'm not going to go
in a lot of detail here.

867
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,159
But the idea is that through
creativity, expert knowledge,

868
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:38,549
and analysis you're going to
define your components, which

869
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,910
are essentially the rows in
the morphological matrix.

870
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,569
But you're also going to
establish rules that tell you

871
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:48,600
which combinations are
actually valid combinations

872
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,949
and which ones are not.

873
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:52,289
And that, in fact,
is [? Narek's ?] PhD

874
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:56,309
topic is, how do you
increase the number

875
00:40:56,309 --> 00:41:01,150
of physics-based rules rather
than just empirical rules.

876
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,400
Because if you think about it.

877
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,410
If you apply rules that are
just based on current practice,

878
00:41:07,409 --> 00:41:09,000
then you're just
going to recreate

879
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,280
concepts and architectures
we already have.

880
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,100
You won't really come up with
something fundamentally new

881
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:16,259
because you've constrained
the combinations

882
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:18,570
to what people do now.

883
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,900
So the real challenge here
is, between generating

884
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,240
all possible combinations,
many of which

885
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,759
are infeasible and only the
ones that we currently have,

886
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,530
there's a middle ground there.

887
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,019
So that's architecture
enumeration,

888
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:36,090
and there's different
ways of doing this

889
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,380
at different layers
of abstraction.

890
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:42,780
So here's an example
of airplanes,

891
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,640
different configurations
of airplanes.

892
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:47,190
If you think about
the tail of airplanes,

893
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:54,269
we have the traditional tail
with a lower stabilizer.

894
00:41:54,269 --> 00:41:55,349
We have T tails.

895
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:59,099
We have we have V tails.

896
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:04,349
I mean, there's like 12
different tail geometries here.

897
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:07,799
And you could think of this for
the wings, for the fuselage,

898
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,300
for the engine
locations, very quickly,

899
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:14,310
you can generate thousands or
even millions of architectures.

900
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:18,119
But at that higher abstraction
layer, it's just a single tail.

901
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:23,190
So how do you combine these
using compositional rules?

902
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,130
That's architecture enumeration.

903
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,880


904
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,510
So here's also an example
from [? Narek's ?] work.

905
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,350
So at an engine, a
turbo prop engine

906
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:36,389
at a high level of
abstraction, that's

907
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:39,809
basically a propeller,
an intake, a core,

908
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,250
and a core nozzle.

909
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:44,309
And then to break that concept
in further detail, the core

910
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:47,489
itself gets shown at a
lower level of detail.

911
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,169
And you can see that
inside the core,

912
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,470
you have, in this case, a single
compressor, a burner, and then

913
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:55,289
a turbine that drives
the compressor.

914
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:58,590
And so one of the
advances in engines

915
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:03,420
has been from World War II to go
from single-stage to two-stage,

916
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,230
thee-stage engines,
and so forth.

917
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,349
So the complexity
has been going up,

918
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:10,710
but you can actually generate
through architectural

919
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,369
enumeration, essentially,
all architectures

920
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:16,500
that have been built
and that are known

921
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,429
and have been certified through
a organized architecture

922
00:43:20,429 --> 00:43:22,589
enumeration process.

923
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:24,329
Some of this can
be done in Excel,

924
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:26,639
for example, where
you essentially

925
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:27,789
list your components.

926
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:29,670
This is your library
of components.

927
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:31,470
And then on a
different sheet, you

928
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:33,750
define all the
different rules that

929
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,690
allow you to combine
different number of instances

930
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,030
of these components
into architectures.

931
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,850
And we'll post some
information on this

932
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:47,219
if you want to try this
out for your concepts.

933
00:43:47,219 --> 00:43:49,169
So let me summarize.

934
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:53,519
So system architecture is
definitely very abstract,

935
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:56,679
but it's also, potentially,
the most influential activity

936
00:43:56,679 --> 00:43:58,095
that we do in
system architecting.

937
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:01,289
The concept is mapping
function to form.

938
00:44:01,289 --> 00:44:03,360
We typically, in the
conceptual design,

939
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,840
don't do all the details.

940
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,490
We just go down two
levels of abstraction.

941
00:44:07,489 --> 00:44:09,929
So not all the
details are defined.

942
00:44:09,929 --> 00:44:14,129
The NASA approach
specify or is really

943
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,800
focused on this idea of
logical decomposition, which

944
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,370
is very important, but
it's not the only thing

945
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,170
we do in system architecture.

946
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,840
And then the really cool
part, the exciting part

947
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,269
in concept generation is
the one that it's really

948
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:29,699
a creative activity.

949
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:34,230
And when you look at the set
of creativity techniques,

950
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,079
you can think of group dynamics
like the brainstorming.

951
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:40,139
That's used very
heavily, but you

952
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:41,819
have to do it the right way.

953
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:43,740
If you organize a
brainstorming session,

954
00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:47,789
and there's some wiggle
room, but if you violate

955
00:44:47,789 --> 00:44:50,039
some fundamental principles
of brainstorming,

956
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:52,679
you're not going to
get the full benefit.

957
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:53,399
Models.

958
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,820
So thinking about really
creative individuals

959
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,970
and what drove them, what
were their principles,

960
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:03,099
and try to emulate some of that.

961
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:04,659
And then the
structured processes,

962
00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:07,420
which include mind maps,
morphological matrices,

963
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,710
and then architecture
enumeration.

964
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,699
So when you look at
assignment A3, which is now

965
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,699
out there, that's
really what it is about,

966
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:19,629
is you've done the stakeholder
analysis and initial CONOPS,

967
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,980
you have a requirements set.

968
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:26,050
So now be unchained, and
within the constraints

969
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,480
that are set by the
competition, come up

970
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,949
with different concepts.

971
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:34,449
And in the homework, what
I ask you to do in A3

972
00:45:34,449 --> 00:45:37,419
is try out at least two
different techniques,

973
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,670
a structured one and
an unstructured one

974
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,889
and then compare the results.

975
00:45:41,889 --> 00:45:44,940
And this will be
due in two weeks.

976
00:45:44,940 --> 00:46:00,758
