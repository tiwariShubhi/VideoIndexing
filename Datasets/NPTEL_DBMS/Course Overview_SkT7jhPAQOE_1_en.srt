1
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:28,450
welcome to database management systems in
this course we will have forty modules each

2
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:39,308
module would be of about half an hour so this
is the first module where we would talk about

3
00:00:39,308 --> 00:00:53,439
the overview of the course 
so we will discuss the importance of database

4
00:00:53,439 --> 00:01:04,039
management systems in modern day applications
and will familiarize you with different aspects

5
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:13,609
of the course so this will be the outline
first we will try to explain why we need databases

6
00:01:13,609 --> 00:01:23,180
and then we will run through a k y c on the
course prerequisites course outline the textbook

7
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:33,940
and the t s who will help us in this course
so first why do we need databases a database

8
00:01:33,939 --> 00:01:44,780
management system contains information about
a particular enterprise so it deals with collection

9
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:56,340
of interrelated data we have a set of programs
which access and manipulate that data and

10
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:06,409
together a d b m s presents an environment
for convenient as well as efficient use of

11
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:17,560
data of the enterprise under consideration
so there could be different database application

12
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,610
actually if we look around in the world that
we are living today every aspect of our life

13
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:33,549
has been touched by certain database application
some of the very common and wide applications

14
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:47,389
will include banking we are doing net banking
very regularly net banking is a highly distributed

15
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:55,070
database application that allow us to do different
kinds of retail as well as corporate banking

16
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:02,729
we have we perform different kind of booking
reservation railway reservation airline reservation

17
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,668
hotel reservations all of these are

18
00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:14,760
now possible over internet as well these are
all big database applications when we are

19
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:24,060
attending colleges universities the students
courses teachers course enrolments performance

20
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:31,969
of the students and different courses examination
all ah are parts of huge university database

21
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:41,379
applications there are different cells applications
online retailing applications like i am sure

22
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:50,650
all of you ah have been using some of the
amazon flip kart e bay snap deal all these

23
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:58,150
are online retail database applications which
allow us to order to select items to make

24
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:07,009
payments and to track the deliveries of different
items that we have ordered there are database

25
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:14,659
applications in terms of manufacturing production
systems inventory management any big factory

26
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:22,399
of manufacturing need to use a huge database
application to manage the supply chain the

27
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:30,939
inventory the orders everything there are
database applications in human resources applications

28
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:43,160
like ah linkedin are huge human resource application
of database the social media applications

29
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,560
all involve different kinds of database applications
so in this database management system course

30
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:00,339
we are going to understand how such applications
can be designed developed and managed over

31
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:07,409
a period of time database applications are
typically characterized by the fact that they

32
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,530
are very large if we have a relatively small
set of data then possibly will be able to

33
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:23,649
manage it in terms of using an excel sheet
or a couple of excel sheets but soon when

34
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:32,189
it goes beyond a certain size we need a database
application so the fact of being large is

35
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:37,740
a critical factor of any d b m s

36
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:45,590
so with all this we as we observe the database
says cover all aspects of our life and hence

37
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:53,310
understanding d b m s s is a critical requirement
for any computer science information technology

38
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:02,680
student so if we talk about a specific ah
database example say ah university database

39
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,530
then will have several application programs
which will allow us to do several required

40
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:15,469
applications like when new students join we
would need to add the students we will need

41
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:23,850
to add new courses when courses are floated
the will need to add new instructors when

42
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:30,390
faculty join will need to do allotments will
need to do registration of students for courses

43
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:36,240
will need to conduct examinations will need
to assign grades to students when they are

44
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:43,870
graded for different courses and compute their
g p a and so on so all the activities that

45
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:52,590
a university has to deal with are application
programs of varied kinds that the university

46
00:06:52,589 --> 00:07:02,459
database need to work with in the earlier
days before the days of databases ah typically

47
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:10,149
such applications used to be managed through
file systems we all know that all our system

48
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:18,418
has a file system where different files text
as well as data files can be stored and information

49
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:25,949
can be written in these files in a certain
order and just to quickly recall file systems

50
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:33,519
typically have ah a large number of sequential
files which can be written and read in a certain

51
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:40,699
order and some random access files where you
can ah reach a particular point in the file

52
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,110
to do certain access operation certain manipulation
operations

53
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,300
so in the earlier days it was a collection
of file systems which managed large enterprise

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:08:00,160
data as is required but over time it was observed
that the file systems to store data to manage

55
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,540
data has a lot of drawbacks for example if
you look at in a file system there is often

56
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:14,580
a lot of data redundancy and inconsistency
ah these are terms which we will loosely define

57
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,490
here and as we go across along the course
will understand these terms better but redundancy

58
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,980
just to explain redundancy is a concept where
the same data is written at multiple places

59
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,579
in different forms and that may give rise
to several forms of inconsistencies because

60
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:41,059
if you write the same data in multiple files
because you need to ah deal with ah many of

61
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:47,069
these aspects so there is a file for students
there is a file for teachers there is a file

62
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,990
for ah particular courses there is a file
for enrolment and so on several data items

63
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,480
may be ah redundantly copied in multiple files
and once that is done then we can it is very

64
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,730
easy to get inconsistent in terms of the data
because you may update the data in one file

65
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,740
and may forget to update the data in another
file

66
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,210
so that is one of the first problems with
using the file systems then this difficulty

67
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:23,990
in accessing the data because as i said the
data is the files often are sequential in

68
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:30,080
nature even if they are random access then
every task might need to use data from multiple

69
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,960
files and opening those files and reaching
to the appropriate point of access is a non

70
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:46,060
trivial task then there is issues of data
isolation because there are multiple types

71
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:52,929
of files there are multiple formats used therein
very importantly there are a lot of integrity

72
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:59,399
problems the database any database ah application
need to have a lot of integrity for example

73
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,289
if you want to withdraw money from an account
bank account then certainly the balance needs

74
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:09,990
to be positive you can you draw only that
much amount up to that much amount which is

75
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:16,310
which exists in the in the account so any
application will need to check for this so

76
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:23,689
if you use a file system based application
to store the data then at every point wherever

77
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:29,390
you are updating the balance you will need
to make such checks which make the application

78
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:35,750
quite complicated and often creates the possibility
that certain integrity checks may be missed

79
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:43,379
out so it is hard to code these new constraints
over a period of time then there are issues

80
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:49,990
of atomicity of update what atomicity means
is the ability to do certain operations in

81
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:58,580
a in a in a single as a single unit so what
you want is ah either that operation happens

82
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,889
or the and and if it happens then it happens
in full in totality whereas otherwise it may

83
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:10,350
not happen at all for example consider that
there is a funds being transformed from one

84
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,250
account to another so this means the account
from which the funds are being transferred

85
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:22,769
needs to be debited certain amount and that
same amount has to get credited to the accounts

86
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:24,970
to which it is being paid

87
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:34,019
now if for some reason of failure or because
of the fact that there was link issues or

88
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:41,750
something if you are not able to um ah make
this whole transfer then it is possible that

89
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,339
you have already debited the account but you
have not been able to create that account

90
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:53,640
now this will be a a major cause of inconsistency
in the in the database so what what you want

91
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,689
is if the transfer can happen then it must
happen in totality that is what that debit

92
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,880
and the credit must happen together or nothing
should happen at all so these are there are

93
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:10,039
several examples of requirement of automaticity
for a update which is critical for maintaining

94
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:19,490
consistency of the data the other aspect which
has become very very deeply required in every

95
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,509
aspect of database is concurrency of access
if there is a database then certainly there

96
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:29,610
is not a single user there are multiple hundreds
of users you think about net banking you think

97
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:39,200
about ah railway reservation multiple users
are trying to make bookings in multiple ah

98
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,610
trains from varied stations to vary stations
in different classes and so on so all of this

99
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,930
must go on at the same time that is what is
called the concurrency of update

100
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:58,469
so it is quite possible that while you are
trying to update you check the um ah but availability

101
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,370
on a certain train on a certain date that
you intend to travel at the same time someone

102
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,560
else may be checking for the berth availability
on the same train on the same date and there

103
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:14,659
could be conflict of concurrency because there
may be one berth available and you are trying

104
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,480
to book that you have seen that one berth
is available so you go ahead and book it try

105
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,300
to book it and there is another user who also
saw that one berth is available and that user

106
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:30,799
makes payments and tries to book that so concurrency
needs to make sure that both of these users

107
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,250
should not be allowed to make the booking
to the same berth because then that will be

108
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:43,070
a disaster so uncontrolled concurrency can
add to several inconsistencies in the application

109
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,940
then certainly there are you all would be
very familiar that today we are living under

110
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,290
a whole lot of security threats

111
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:57,449
so there has to be ah proper security that
it should be possible to ah um access the

112
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:04,790
data by a user to the extent the user is allowed
to do that ah so as a user you should be able

113
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,120
to access certain parts of the data the manager
of the system the administrator should be

114
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,909
able to access a bigger part of the data possibly
so security is hard to provide in terms of

115
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:24,659
a file system based applications to store
data so all these with we conclude the data

116
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:33,409
based systems had those which provide solution
to take care against all those above problems

117
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:41,079
and ah we are trying to learn how to do such
things so moving on ah i would quickly take

118
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:48,389
you through ah familiarizing with you with
the ah overall ah plan of the course so what

119
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:56,100
we we first i talk about are the course prerequisites
ah these prerequisites are kind of certain

120
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,930
elementary level knowledge in computer science
and related discrete mathematics that you

121
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,609
should have you should be that would make
it easier for you to understand and follow

122
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:14,570
the course otherwise if you find at any stage
that you are finding any of this aspect difficult

123
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:20,360
to follow in the course then i would advise
that you ah go back to some of the background

124
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,539
material and try to study them

125
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:30,129
so i have tried to list down ah this prerequisite
topics one certainly is the set theory because

126
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:37,700
that is the basic premise on which databases
are designed on so starting from definition

127
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:44,300
of the set membership concepts of subset superset
power set different operations of union intersection

128
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:51,299
complementation difference cartesian product
de morgans law all these basic set theory

129
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,750
you should be very familiar and conversant
with if you are not i have mentioned one moocs

130
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,480
course ah um this is a past course but you
can access the videos and the contents ah

131
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:10,009
which has a very nice discussion on these
aspects of set theory which you may refer

132
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:19,610
to ah moving on the next which goes on top
of the sets are the concept of relations and

133
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:32,350
functions we all know that a relation is a
um ah subset of a set so if i have a set a

134
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:41,079
then i can define a binary relation over that
set a which is basically the pair of elements

135
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:48,489
from set a or in other words the relation
binary relation is a subset of the cross product

136
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:56,509
of a with itself where the domain and the
range are related together so there are concepts

137
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:04,028
of the image of a domain the pre image of
the range the inverse relation and several

138
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:10,019
basic properties of relations like the relation
being reflexive symmetric antisymmetric transitive

139
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,548
total relations and
so on you should be familiar with these otherwise

140
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:21,269
you will find difficult to ah follow major
concepts in the database systems because this

141
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:26,068
tribal system primarily the one that we are
going to ah take you through in this course

142
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:31,519
is relational in model so it is heavily based
on relations and functions and you should

143
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:37,940
understand one specifically a relation becomes
a function and when what is meant by functions

144
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,909
being injective subjective bijective what
is meant by composition and inverse of functions

145
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:48,700
and so on again if you need you can refer
to this moocs course on discrete mathematics

146
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:58,230
to brush up your knowledge about relations
and functions we also need you to have a basic

147
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:04,480
understanding of the propositional logic which
is truth values true and false and the different

148
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:12,048
operations of conjunction disjunction negation
that is and or not ah what is meant by implication

149
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:20,730
what is meant by equivalence you know that
given two variables which have or two propositions

150
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,179
which can take a value true or false the conjunction
of them can be represented in terms of a truth

151
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:36,100
table where we say that only when both these
propositions are true then the resultant conjunctive

152
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:39,730
proposition becomes true otherwise a conjunctive
proposition is false

153
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:46,778
so you should be familiar with these ah concepts
if you are not please brush up your ah ideas

154
00:18:46,778 --> 00:18:52,700
about propositional logic we need a little
bit of predicate logic as well a predicate

155
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:59,580
logic in contrast to propositional logic deals
with quantification that the knowledge of

156
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:05,329
existential and universal quantifier when
you say that whether certain proposition predicates

157
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:12,089
hold for all values in the domain or for some
value in the domain whether there exists some

158
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:17,738
value for which it holds or whether for all
values it holds and based on that predicate

159
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:26,090
logic is build up we do not need very advanced
concept concept here just basic level familiarization

160
00:19:26,089 --> 00:19:32,148
will help and the same moocs course on discrete
mathematics would be of your help in case

161
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:42,378
you need to ah brush it up further on ah aspects
of computer science certainly you need a ah

162
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:48,158
good familiarity with the data structures
are a list particularly binary search tree

163
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:52,250
what is called a binary search tree what is
meant by a height of a binary search tree

164
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,130
when we say that a binary search tree is balanced
what are the ways and conditions of balancing

165
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:07,239
is particularly um ah the b trees for organizing
good search trees hash tables what is hashing

166
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:14,909
we need you to be familiar with with this
concept because the databases will be heavily

167
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,990
designed based on the concepts of b trees
and hash tables and so on

168
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,378
ah there are courses on design and analysis
of algorithms fundamental of algorithms have

169
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:32,788
mentioned two excellent courses in moocs from
which you can brush up if you need to ah certainly

170
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:40,138
you need certain familiarity with common algorithms
particularly i had mentioned sorting and searching

171
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:47,168
algorithms because these are critical for
database applications and again ah the um

172
00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:54,038
the same moocs courses would be of your help
and it will be good to have familiarity with

173
00:20:54,038 --> 00:21:00,829
programming in c because several of the applications
need some application high level application

174
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:08,079
programming to be performed and we would assume
that those aspects we described in c because

175
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:14,418
that is a fundamental and most commonly known
language ah besides these prerequisites which

176
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:20,619
i have marked as essential ah because they
will certainly be required for the major parts

177
00:21:20,618 --> 00:21:25,839
of the course it will be good if you have
some familiarity with object oriented analysis

178
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:34,249
and design and some language which is more
heavily object oriented object aligned in

179
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:42,929
nature like c plus plus or java so um again
some moocs courses the related moocs courses

180
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:51,419
are mentioned here in case you need to brush
up moving on this is your course outline so

181
00:21:51,419 --> 00:22:00,679
as i said the course comprise forty modules
so it is divided into eight weeks so this

182
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:08,860
plan is given based on what we do in different
weeks from week one to week eight so as the

183
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:13,839
course unfolds you will be able to ah you
will you will take will take you through these

184
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:21,649
modules on these topics and on the right you
can find that i have marked that the initial

185
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:30,100
part of the course which we cover from week
one to first half of week five is primarily

186
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:36,260
meant for application programming which is
a which it means that the database system

187
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,589
has already been designed and basic premises
the schemas and constraints have been set

188
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:43,589
up but

189
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:48,859
now you want to write different data query
different data manipulation applications and

190
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:55,038
that is where the large volume of database
engineers work so they are called application

191
00:22:55,038 --> 00:23:01,048
programmers so that is the i should say the
first level in terms of a database understanding

192
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:09,460
and you must target to become a master of
application programming to get started with

193
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,610
the other half of the course which start from
the middle of week five with the storage and

194
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:23,798
file structure and goes on till the next is
meant for the analysts who are responsible

195
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:30,220
either for designing a particular database
which the application programmer can use ah

196
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:39,200
tune that for performance ah index it properly
design queries to be efficient so these kind

197
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,369
of analysts will be involved the more with
the understanding of the second part of the

198
00:23:44,368 --> 00:23:50,888
course and the second part of the course would
also be useful for the database a d b m s

199
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:57,119
designers if you want to really become an
advanced programmer we want to work on database

200
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:03,048
engineering in terms of creating database
management systems not merely creating databases

201
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:09,388
or database applications then you need to
have a good initial command over the ah second

202
00:24:09,388 --> 00:24:15,628
half of the course so ah while you prepare
for the course where you go through the modules

203
00:24:15,628 --> 00:24:20,848
please keep this in mind that your familiarity
with the application programming must be at

204
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:27,989
the highest level and in the later parts will
be relatively little advanced but they are

205
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:39,419
required for good design and ah good development
of consistent ah efficient system in in future

206
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:46,419
ah we will follow a textbook this is um as
you can see this is a sixth edition that i

207
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:54,419
am following in this course it is called database
system concept by ah silberschatz korth and

208
00:24:54,419 --> 00:25:01,538
sudarshan this is kind of a classical book
in database systems ah ah current version

209
00:25:01,538 --> 00:25:03,798
actually is the seventh edition

210
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:09,509
so if you get access to the seventh edition
you can use that as well but whatever we are

211
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:16,649
following in this course sixth edition is
good enough so i advise the that you try to

212
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:27,489
get a copy of this book to yourself ah so
moving on ah we have different three t as

213
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:37,359
we will help you in this course srijoni majumdar
ah himadri bhushan bhuyan and gurunath reddy

214
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:44,808
so these are their emails i have also put
their mobile numbers however i would advise

215
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:50,878
that unless you are really stuck avoid calling
them on the mobile because they are research

216
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:57,238
students as well ah busy with their own work
as well but they can certainly put all your

217
00:25:57,239 --> 00:26:04,058
questions on the forum which will be promptly
responded by some of these t as or by myself

218
00:26:04,058 --> 00:26:10,589
and in case you would have very specific follow
ups to do you can write email to one or all

219
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,629
of these t as

220
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:23,249
so this is about the course overview so in
this module we have discussed about the importance

221
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:31,220
about database management systems in the modern
day applications and we have tried to familiarize

222
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:38,489
you with different aspects of the course and
i reiterate that please ah give due consideration

223
00:26:38,489 --> 00:26:47,929
to the prerequisites as mentioned we have
ah floated in an assignment called assignment

224
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:55,048
zero where there are questions on different
aspects of these prerequisites please try

225
00:26:55,048 --> 00:27:03,460
to solve that assignment and see your ah performance
ah this assignment i would like to mention

226
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:09,979
that this assignment will not go in the final
evaluation of the performance of the course

227
00:27:09,979 --> 00:27:15,940
this is just to give you an idea for self
assessment of your preparedness for this course

228
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:23,519
so if you find that on questions on certain
topics say on relation function or on data

229
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,638
structure if you have not been able to answer
the questions well then it will be good to

230
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:38,998
check back and go through the prerequisites
once more but please keep in mind that database

231
00:27:38,999 --> 00:27:47,210
management system is a ah course which depends
on these background knowledge quite heavily

232
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:54,989
so if you have gaps in understanding those
topics then all through the course you will

233
00:27:54,989 --> 00:28:02,759
get into several difficulties in understanding
and problem solving so that is about our first

234
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:08,489
module so from the next module we will start
introducing the database management system

235
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:13,838
enjoy the course and try to learn try to become
a good database engineer
