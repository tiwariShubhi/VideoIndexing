00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:20,410
.
Welcome to module 14 of database management

2
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,750
systems.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,259
In the last module we will started our discussions
on the entity relationship model, we will

4
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:33,980
continue that in this module as well, and
actually conclude it in the next module.

5
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:40,148
So, these are the items that we had discussed
in the last module.

6
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:48,230
In the present one, we will first illustrate
the entity relationship diagram notation;

7
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:54,768
that graphical notation for E-R model, how
nicely this can be shown in terms of certain

8
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,079
diagrams.

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:04,829
And then we will explore how E-R models can
be translated to relational schemas, which

10
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:13,379
is a basic step of the logical design . So,
these are the topics.

11
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,709
So, we start with the E-R diagram.

12
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:23,280
Naturally the first thing to represent in
ah an E-R model is the entity set.

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,920
Every entity set is represented by a rectangle.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,900
On the top, we write the name of that entity
set.

15
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,410
As you can see examples here the instructor.

16
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,879
And student are the 2 entity sets and below
that we write the names of the attributes

17
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,530
that are involved.

18
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:47,950
And we underline the attribute or attributes
that form the primary key of that entity set

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,400
.
A relationship between ah 2 entity sets is

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,600
represented by a diamond, and 2 connecting
lines to the 2 entity sets.

21
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:08,169
So, here it says that advisor is a relationship
between entity set instructor, and entity

22
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,609
set student.

23
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:18,620
Trying to convey the real-world situation
that students are advised by the instructors

24
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:27,968
or students have instructors and so on .
As we had mentioned that relationships could

25
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,098
also have attributes.

26
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:37,120
So, if the advisor relationship has an attribute
date then it will be tagged to the adviser

27
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,239
relationship with the attribute coming as
a within a rectangle and attached to the name

28
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,998
of the relationship by a dotted line.

29
00:02:48,998 --> 00:02:52,519
So, this shows that advisor is the relationship
between instructor.

30
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,230
And student and the adviser relationship has
an attribute date .

31
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:11,209
It is possible that ah the relationship that
hold between 2 entity sets can be can use

32
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,878
entity sets which are same.

33
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,310
That is, it is possible that a set is related
to itself.

34
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:27,959
So, as an example we show, the entity set
course which has a relationship prereq, prerequisite

35
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:35,289
which takes a course id, and relates it to
another course id called the prerequisite

36
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:36,289
id.

37
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,628
Because obviously, if a course has a prerequisite.

38
00:03:38,628 --> 00:03:44,638
Then that prerequisite itself is another course
id which must occur in this table itself.

39
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:52,879
So, in this case, if you can see that unlike
the earlier ah case the prereq id is not actually

40
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,688
a field of this ah relation course.

41
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,318
So, we say these are rules.

42
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:12,438
So, we say the rule that prereq relate from
the course relation to itself are course id

43
00:04:12,438 --> 00:04:20,399
and prereq id; where in the actual table both
of them relate to course id, but prereq will

44
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:28,810
pair them to show which course has what prerequisite.

45
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,870
And we often need this kind of; we have ah
seen ah similar instances of this while we

46
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,569
treated dealt with the recursive queries in
databases.

47
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:47,199
The source destination of ah aligns problem
that we discussed has similar kind of relationship

48
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,199
structure.

49
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:58,279
So, you can think about a relationship flies
from the set of ah source to this set of destination,

50
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:04,149
and basically this these 2 sets the places
source places in the destination place are

51
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:11,000
necessarily the same set the same relation
. There could be a constraint on the cardinality.

52
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,560
So, the line that links the relationship diamond
with the rectangles of the relations rectangles

53
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,879
of the entity sets.

54
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:31,149
Those lines could have an arrow at the end
or may not have an arrow at the end.

55
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:38,689
So, if it has got an arrow, then it means
that suppose it has an arrow it means 1.

56
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,540
And if it does not have a arrow if it is simple
then it means many.

57
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:50,780
So, using this rotation we can designate one
to one one to many these all different kinds

58
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:53,779
of cardinalities that we had discussed.

59
00:05:53,779 --> 00:06:02,319
So, for example, if we are showing this ah
arrow on both hands, both ends of this relationship

60
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,829
advisor then, it means that it is a one to
one relationship.

61
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:08,689
Because there is an arrow here.

62
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:12,569
So, this is 1 . There is an arrow here.

63
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:13,689
So, this is 1.

64
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:15,180
There is an arrow here.

65
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:24,129
So, this is 1; which means that a student
is associated at most with at most one instructor.

66
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:30,319
And it also means that and an instructor is
associated with at most student.

67
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,649
This may not be a reality this usually is
not the reality, but this we are just showing

68
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:36,339
this as an example.

69
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:46,139
So, if the student instructor relationship
advisor relationship is one to one, then this

70
00:06:46,139 --> 00:07:00,389
is how we will denote it .
If it is one to many . So, which side is 1,

71
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:03,229
this side is 1 and this side is many.

72
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:11,250
So, it is one to many from instructor to student;
which says that every student has at most

73
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,079
one instructor.

74
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:17,930
And an instructor may have several students.

75
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,269
It could be null also it could be none also.

76
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:25,990
So, for an instructor here there are many
students, but for a student here there are

77
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,750
only at most one instructor.

78
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:35,279
So, it is one to many and this is how we designate
a similar thing will happen, if I read the

79
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,250
same relation in the other direction.

80
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,319
So, instructor to student was one to many.

81
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:51,430
So, student instructor also drawn in the same
way, because this is ah this is the one side,

82
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,990
this is the one side and this is the many
side.

83
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,449
So, if the situation is the same.

84
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:02,060
So, if we read from the student instructor,
then it is also designates the many to one

85
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,519
relationship.

86
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,599
And finally, we can have a many to many relationship,
where there is no arrow at either end which

87
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,530
means that an instructor is associated with.

88
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:19,079
Several possibly none no student why the advisor
relation and the student may also have several

89
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,229
instructors by the advisor relationship.

90
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:28,680
Now, we can you can certainly figure out that
in the particular case of student instructor

91
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,509
scenario of providing advice, one to one as
well as many to many are not the usual real

92
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:43,259
world scenarios, but these are we have just
using to show you how to model this usual

93
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:48,179
scenario would be from instructor to student
it is one to many relationship .

94
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:57,778
A relationship could be total or it could
be partial.

95
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:04,549
If you if one side of the relationship, or
whichever side of the relationship is total,

96
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,058
then we draw a double line.

97
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:12,269
So, you can you can see here in the diagram
we are drawing a double line, which means

98
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:18,179
that in the advisor relationship the involvement
of the student is total, which means that

99
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:22,188
every student must feature in the advisor
relationship.

100
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:27,439
Or in other words every student must have
an advisor.

101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:44,999
But it is partial on the instructor side because
every instructor may not have a student .

102
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:56,439
So, this double life shows that reality . Some
entities may not participate in any relationship

103
00:09:56,438 --> 00:10:04,929
is a partial .
Now, this ah constraints the cardinality constraints

104
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,278
can be made more precise by actually using
numbers.

105
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,470
You can actually say on the 2 sides of the
relationship, that at the minimum how many

106
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,259
entities should relate, and at the maximum
how many entities can relate.

107
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:27,050
For example, if we are saying that we are
on the right-hand side here, if you see we

108
00:10:27,049 --> 00:10:34,349
are saying that it is maximum minimum is one
maximum is one which what does it say it says

109
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,769
that every student the minimum is one.

110
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:42,659
So, every student must feature in the advisor
relationship.

111
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:51,500
So, in real world, every student must have
a an advisor, must have an instructor.

112
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,929
It says maximum is one; which says that every
student can have at most one instructor.

113
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:03,138
So, this one to one one, dot dot one says
that every student must have at least one

114
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:06,680
instructor, every student must have at most
one instructor.

115
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:12,739
So, together it says that every student must
have exactly one instructor.

116
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:20,289
Whereas if I if we see on this side, it says
that 0 dot, dot, star, star stands for no

117
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,389
limit.

118
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,860
It can be anything any number.

119
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:29,310
So, the minimum is 0 which means that an instructor
may not have a student.

120
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:33,278
And star says that if the instructor can have
any number of student.

121
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,688
Naturally 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, or 200.

122
00:11:37,688 --> 00:11:41,049
So, any instructor can advise any number of
students.

123
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:50,919
So, these kind of precise number constraints
can be put in addition to the one to many,

124
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,149
or one to one, many to many kind of notations
in the diagram.

125
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:04,639
So, when we do that we have the precise cardinality
of the complex relations that exist .

126
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:17,009
Next, we take a look into the handling of
the complex attributes.

127
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:22,769
The first you remember that, the first kind
of complex attribute is 1 which is composite.

128
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:34,558
Say, name which has first name middle name,
initial middle initials and last name.

129
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:48,328
So, when we have that, then the way we represent
is at the actual name of the attribute is

130
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:51,138
at the outermost level.

131
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:57,438
And it is composites are written with certain
shift on the left.

132
00:12:57,438 --> 00:13:00,269
So, these all say that these are composites
of name.

133
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:09,379
So, if this says that street city state zip
are composites of address, and further indentation

134
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,438
say, that these are composites of street.

135
00:13:12,438 --> 00:13:19,159
So, this is how graphically we show that how
complex attributes feature .

136
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:29,610
Now, let us go back to discussing the weak
entity sets.

137
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:37,470
In the E-R diagram, a weak entity set is represented
by a double rectangle.

138
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,569
You remember the section is a weak entity
set.

139
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,269
And why is it so?

140
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:48,278
Because the same course may have 2 different,
I am sorry, 2 different courses may have the

141
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:55,739
same section id semester and year that is
2 courses 2 or more courses may run sections

142
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,429
by the same name in the same semester and
the year.

143
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:05,100
So, a section cannot be uniquely identified
by these 3 attributes.

144
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:13,600
It needs a relationship with the identifying
entity set course to be specific the course

145
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,278
id so that the entities here in can be uniquely
specified.

146
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,299
So, since this has happened.

147
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:29,528
So, we designate that by putting this double
rectangle around the weak entity set section

148
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:36,759
. We underlined the discriminator of a weak
entity set with dashed line.

149
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,789
So, you remember these are the discriminators.

150
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:46,169
Because given the identifying attribute in
the identifying set.

151
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:54,139
These are the attributes which distinguish
different tuples of section.

152
00:14:54,139 --> 00:15:01,419
So, they are not shown with solid underline,
they are shown as dotted underline, dashed

153
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:02,419
underlined.

154
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:06,309
So, that you can make out that this is a weak
entity set and these are the discriminators

155
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:12,948
.
The relationship set connecting the weak entity

156
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:18,188
set to the identifying strong entity set,
is also so, this the moment you have weak

157
00:15:18,188 --> 00:15:19,188
entity set.

158
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:24,588
You know that there has to be a relationship
to the strong entity set which identifies

159
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:25,589
it.

160
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:34,739
So, that relationship set course which say
, course id against this minds that is designated

161
00:15:34,739 --> 00:15:36,100
with a double diamond.

162
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,928
So, that you know that this is the identifying
relationship between a weak entity set and

163
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:52,738
the corresponding strong entity set . And
once that happens in the primary key becomes

164
00:15:52,739 --> 00:16:00,689
the discriminators of section the weak entity
set, and the primary key of the identifying

165
00:16:00,688 --> 00:16:03,259
a strong entity set the course.

166
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:11,079
So, that forms our final primary key for this
entity set section.

167
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:17,838
My new course id is not a part of this relation,
but it actually plays the role through this

168
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:26,429
section id as a key for the section relation
without which the section entities in the

169
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,519
section cannot be uniquely identified.

170
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,459
So, having said that this is a the E-R diagram
of the university enterprise.

171
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,528
Some of the points that you could take a look
at.

172
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:42,129
This is the weak entity set we have just seen.

173
00:16:42,129 --> 00:16:50,649
This is the relationship to the identifying
strong entity set . This is a prerequisite

174
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:53,919
multi role relationship.

175
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,988
Ah this we can see is a is a total involvement.

176
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:06,459
So, worry why is it a total involvement, because
every section must have at least one teacher.

177
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:11,230
So, there cannot be a section which does not
feature in the teacher's relationship.

178
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,259
Similarly, every section must get a timeslot
where the classes for that section is held.

179
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,029
So, every section must feature in the sec
timeslot.

180
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,319
So, these are the similarly, it must get a
classroom.

181
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,240
So, these are all different total involvements.

182
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,019
That we total roles that we can see we can
see some of that elsewhere as well.

183
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:42,389
For example, you can see it here, we can see
it here, because in between instructor and

184
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,570
the department the inst department relationship
. Certainly, every instructor must have a

185
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,569
department.

186
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:55,059
So, it is total, but it is not the same for
the department, every department will not

187
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,589
have instructors.

188
00:17:56,589 --> 00:18:01,179
So, these is how if we can you can go through
carefully.

189
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,279
And for example, this is another which is
total, which means that every course need

190
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,039
a department you cannot run a course which
does not have a department.

191
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:18,109
So, this is how we can see that how the E-R
diagram that the first conceptual level diagram

192
00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:25,309
of a very simple university enterprise is
being designed following the notions and symbols

193
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:31,049
of E-R model that we have already developed.

194
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:36,349
Next comes the part where, from this model
which is primarily diagram based we have to

195
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:40,879
really go to the relational schema, which
is names of relations and attributes which

196
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,100
is ah pretty much a straightforward job.

197
00:18:44,099 --> 00:18:50,399
So, entity sets and relationship sets have
to be represented in terms of relational schema.

198
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,620
What is the beauty of the E-R model?

199
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:58,519
And the relational schema is that that, when
you reduce the entity relationship model to

200
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,549
relational schema both entity sets and relationships
sets.

201
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:08,579
Both of them turn out to be relational schemas
. And so, that the database finally, can be

202
00:19:08,579 --> 00:19:16,529
represented simply as a set of schemas each
one of which must have a set of identifying

203
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,460
primary key.

204
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,660
So, let us look into that.

205
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:30,920
So, on the strong entity set, that reduces
to schema with the same attribute as student.

206
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,850
So, student has id name and total credit.

207
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:38,129
So, which we saw earlier.

208
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:45,270
Now this gets converted to a schema with id
being the primary key.

209
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:51,389
The other case of weak entity set, section
which had the 3 discriminators, and through

210
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:57,150
set course relationship was identified from
the strong entity set.

211
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:06,320
Course borrows the primary key of the course
to be defined in terms of this relational

212
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:16,919
schema one moment . This borrows ah the primary
key from here and becomes.

213
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:25,370
So, you can see that in the E-R model, the
section did not have course id as an attribute,

214
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:33,139
but while we reduce this to the relational
schema through this sec course relationship,

215
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,020
we have borrowed this primary key from course.

216
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:43,139
The primary key of course, the course id and
added that to section to make it a complete

217
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:52,110
relational schema .
Next comes the representation of relationships.

218
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,859
So, we are showing a relationship advisor.

219
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,269
So, which relates instructors to students.

220
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:05,789
So, naturally every instructor is identified
by id every student is identified by id.

221
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:08,369
Since both of the attributes have the same
name id.

222
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:14,299
We are calling them as s underscore id, and
for the student and I underscore id for the

223
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:15,299
instructor.

224
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:21,399
So, the advisor relation is basically a pairing
of these 2 ids.

225
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,240
Which gives rise to a relationship which looks
like this relationship schema which looks

226
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
like this.

227
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,319
So, it can in general say that if we have
a relationship ah in the E-R model, which

228
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:41,210
we want to represent in the schema then we
will take, we will create a schema which has

229
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:46,120
the primary key of both the sets, and put
them together.

230
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:52,439
And if the names clash we will just change
the name with the name of the relation, and

231
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,720
that will give us the schema for the relationship
in this case the advisor.

232
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:04,880
So, you have seen how to represent entity
sets, weak entity sets and relationships ah

233
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,100
let us look at how do we deal with composite
attributes.

234
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:15,099
Because so far, we had assumed that the relational
schema has attributes, and every attribute

235
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,569
has a domain.

236
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:19,589
The type from where it is values come.

237
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,740
So, if I have a composite attribute, where
every attribute has a set of components.

238
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:31,009
Then the easiest way to handle this is to
what is known as flatten the composite attribute.

239
00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:36,720
So, flattening basically is for example, if
I take a name it has 3 components.

240
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:44,440
So, each one of them I can call by given new
name name underscore first name name underscore

241
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:52,180
middle initial name underscore last name . By
prefixing with the attribute name, I make

242
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,630
the names of these components necessarily
unique.

243
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,500
Now after I do the prefix thing I might figure
out that actually prefixing is not required

244
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,799
first name itself is a unique.

245
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:09,799
Because it does not occur anywhere else if
it is then I can I may drop the prefix name.

246
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:14,960
But in general, I can take the attribute name
prefix on the component, and just flatten

247
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,870
them out make them all attributes each separate
attribute.

248
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:28,069
So, here when we ah flatten out we will have
ah first name, middle, initial, last name

249
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:35,859
as you can see these flattened out from here.

250
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:43,579
Then we have street number, street name, apartment
number, flattened out from the street.

251
00:23:43,579 --> 00:23:46,929
Subsequently, we have city state zip flattened
out from here.

252
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,890
So, all of them flattened out has become separate
attributes.

253
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,570
And flattening is a very straightforward mechanism
by which you can convert complex composite

254
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:02,710
attributes into the regular schema design
.

255
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:06,640
Getting to little bit of issue if you have
a multi valued attribute.

256
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,040
Multivalued attribute is one where one attribute
may have multiple values at the same time.

257
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,799
And the example we talked about is ah a phone
number.

258
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,730
I may have multiple phone numbers.

259
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,120
So, certainly against an attribute I can keep
only one value.

260
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,909
So, if I if my attribute is multiple value.

261
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:31,130
Then the basic idea is to use a separate schema
to maintain this multiple values.

262
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,180
For example, if I have to maintain multiple
phone numbers of an instructor.

263
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,410
I may have a separate I may decide to have
a separate relation . Which relates the key

264
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:48,690
of the instructor relation, and the attribute
that I want to ah maintain multipally.

265
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:56,529
So, in this relationship in this relation
inst underscore phone against the same id

266
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,660
I can have different phone numbers.

267
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:02,529
So, there will be different records which
match on the id, but do not match on the phone

268
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:07,609
number which gives me the different values
that the phone number can take.

269
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:15,109
And then this inst phone in conjunction with
the instructor relation will actually denote

270
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:19,389
the multi valued phone number attribute.

271
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:29,110
So, this is just an example showing that for
one primary key of an instructor 1 to 2 2

272
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:31,109
2 2 and there are 2 phone numbers.

273
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:35,269
So, this will basically mean you have 2 tuples
in the new relation.

274
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:42,490
So, with that we can ah handle multiple multivalued
attributes also.

275
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:49,309
Some of the relationships that we may have
modeled, which we have done ah in ah doing

276
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:54,500
the database E-R schema could have redundancy.

277
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,220
For example, take a case here we have the
instructor.

278
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,680
And we have the student advisor relation is
incidental here, and we have department.

279
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,870
So, we want to say that the instructors belong
to certain departments.

280
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:12,679
Every instructor belongs to one department
which is the totality of the relationship

281
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
here.

282
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,590
Similarly, every student belongs to a department,
totality of the relationship on this side.

283
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:25,500
And inst dept inst dept in that context is
a relationship which is between instructor

284
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,740
and department.

285
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:38,029
Similarly , so, we can there is certain redundancy
in this, because ah we can get make this simpler

286
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:48,160
if we just take the primary key of this relation
and put in here.

287
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,150
If we do that then basically this become redundant
these are no more required.

288
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:58,720
So, all that you are saying is the instructor
has a dept name field which says which department

289
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,259
does it belong to.

290
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:08,799
So, if there is a choice between whether you
will keep such relationships or you will actually

291
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:16,309
reduce the redundancy in the schema, and involve
the primary key of the other relation into

292
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:24,240
your primary table which is instructor or
the student here . So, instead instead of

293
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,890
creating a schema for relationship set inst
department.

294
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,250
You will simply add a department name.

295
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:36,259
So, mind you this is at the at the E-R model
level you did have a separate relationship,

296
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:44,299
but while you reduce it to your relationship
relational schema you are reducing that relationship

297
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:48,089
by including the dept name as an attribute
in instructor.

298
00:27:48,089 --> 00:27:53,349
So, that is called the reduction of schema
which is often used.

299
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:56,240
Ah for one to one relationship.

300
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,349
So, this is this, was ah this is ah good if
you have many to one relation.

301
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:06,929
Because this was possible, because every instructor
has one department.

302
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,019
So, if you just include the department name
with the instructor.

303
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:14,259
Or every student has one department ah.

304
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:21,379
So, it is possible that way, but if you have
a one to one relationship, then naturally

305
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,720
you can do the similar reduction by I by choosing
the either side as the many.

306
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,130
You know, because because the the unique side
has to come on the many side.

307
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,070
The unique side here . This is the unique
side here.

308
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:40,099
Because every instructor has a unique department,
and this is the many side here.

309
00:28:40,099 --> 00:28:43,189
So, the unique side has to attribute has to
come in here.

310
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,840
The unique side primary key has to come in
here.

311
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:53,409
So, instead of ah so, you can apply the same
principle to a one to one relationship by

312
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:59,400
treating any one of them as a many side, and
add the extra attribute on the other side

313
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,580
to get rid of this additional schema.

314
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,449
The schema corresponding to a relationship
set linking a weak entity set to it is underlying

315
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:13,130
strong entity set is certainly redundant,
we have already seen this.

316
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:24,490
So, this ah is made redundant by including
the primary key of the identifying relation,

317
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:30,089
identifying entity set in the weak entity
set . So, that is another reduction of schema

318
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:31,869
that can be done.

319
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:42,219
So, to summarize we have in this module illustrated
the entity relationship diagram, which are

320
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,809
very nice ways of graphically representing
what we see in the real world.

321
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:56,669
So, it has graphical representation of entity
sets, attributes the key attributes primary

322
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:08,970
key attributes the weak entity sets, and the
relationships along with the cardinality information.

323
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:17,720
And then we have shown that using certain
reduction rules how we can easily reduce this

324
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:26,549
entity relationship diagram or entity relationship
model into the traditional relational schema.

325
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:33,849
And we have seen that both the entity sets
as well as the relationship sets become relational

326
00:30:33,849 --> 00:30:34,219
schemas.
